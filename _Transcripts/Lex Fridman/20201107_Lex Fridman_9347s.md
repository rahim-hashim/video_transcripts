# Alex Filippenko: Supernovae, Dark Energy, Aliens & the Expanding Universe | Lex Fridman Podcast #137
**Lex Fridman:** [November 07, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxfA1OSev4c)
*  The following is a conversation with Alex Filippenko, an astrophysicist and professor
*  of astronomy from Berkeley. He was a member of both the Supernova Cosmology Project and the
*  Hi-Z Supernova Search Team which used observations of the extragalactic supernova to discover that
*  the universe is accelerating and that this implies the existence of dark energy. This
*  discovery resulted in the 2011 NOBA Prize for Physics. Outside of his groundbreaking research,
*  he is a great science communicator and is one of the most widely admired educators in the world.
*  I really enjoyed this conversation and am sure Alex will be back again in the future.
*  Quick mention of each sponsor, followed by some thoughts related to the episode.
*  Neuro, the maker of functional sugar-free gum and mints that I used to give my brain
*  a quick caffeine boost. BetterHelp, an online therapy with a licensed professional.
*  MasterClass, online courses that I enjoy from some of the most amazing humans in history.
*  And CashApp, the app I use to send money to friends. Please check out these sponsors in
*  the description to get a discount and to support this podcast. As a side note, let me say that,
*  as we talk about in this conversation, the objects that populate the universe are both
*  awe-inspiring and terrifying in their capacity to create and to destroy us. Solar flares and
*  asteroids lurking in the darkness of space threaten our humble, fragile existence here on Earth.
*  In the chaos, tension, conflict, and social division of 2020, it's easy to forget just how
*  lucky we humans are to be here. And with a bit of hard work, maybe one day we'll venture out
*  towards the stars. If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube, review it with 5 Stars

*  Friedman. And now, here's my conversation with Alex Filopenko. Let's start by talking about the
*  biggest possible thing, the universe. Will the universe expand forever or collapse on itself?
*  Well, that's a great question. That's one of the big questions of cosmology. And of course,
*  we have evidence that the matter density is sufficiently low that the universe will
*  expand forever. But not only that, there's this weird repulsive effect. We call it dark energy
*  for want of a better term, and it appears to be accelerating the expansion of the universe.
*  So if that continues, the universe will expand forever. But it need not necessarily continue.
*  It could reverse sign, in which case the universe could, in principle, collapse at some point in the
*  far, far future. So in terms of investment advice, if you were to give me and then to bet all my
*  money on one or the other, where does your intuition currently lie? Well, right now,
*  I would say that it would expand forever because I think that the dark energy is likely to be
*  just quantum fluctuations of the vacuum. The vacuum zero energy state is not a state of zero energy.
*  That is the ground state is a state of some elevated energy, which has a repulsive effect to it.
*  And that will never go away because it's not something that changes with time. So if the
*  universe is accelerating now, it will forever continue to do so. And yet, I mean, you so
*  effortlessly mentioned dark energy. Do we have any understanding of what the heck that thing is?
*  AC Well, not really, but we're getting progressively better observational constraints. So
*  different theories of what it might be predict different sorts of behavior for the evolution
*  of the universe. And we've been measuring the evolution of the universe now. And the data
*  appear to agree with the predictions of a constant density vacuum energy, a zero point
*  energy. But one can't prove that that's what it is because one would have to show that the measured
*  numbers agree with the predictions to an arbitrary number of decimal places. And of course, even if
*  you've got eight, nine, 10, 12 decimal places, what if in the 13th one, the measurements significantly
*  differ from the prediction, then the dark energy isn't this vacuum state, ground state energy
*  of the vacuum. And so then it could be some sort of a field, some sort of a new energy, a little
*  bit like light, like electromagnetism, but very different from light, that fills space. And that
*  type of energy could in principle change in the distant future. It could become gravitationally
*  attractive for all we know. There is a historical precedent to that. And that is that the inflation
*  with which the universe began when the universe was just a tiny blink of an eye old, a trillionth
*  of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second, the universe went whoosh, it exponentially expanded.
*  That dark energy like substance, we call it the inflaton, that which inflated the universe,
*  later decayed into more or less normal gravitationally attractive matter. So the
*  exponential early expansion of the universe did transition to a deceleration, which then
*  dominated the universe for about 9 billion years. And now this small amount of dark energy
*  started causing an acceleration about 5 billion years ago. And whether that will continue or not
*  is something that we'd like to answer, but I don't know that we will anytime soon.
*  LW So there could be this interesting field that we don't yet understand
*  that's morphing over time, that's changing the way the universe is expanding. I mean,
*  it's funny that you were thinking through this rigorously like an experimentalist.
*  AC Yeah.
*  LW But what about like the fundamental physics of dark energy? Is there any understanding
*  of what the heck it is? Or is this the kind of the God of the gaps or the field of the gaps?
*  So like, there must be something there because of what we're observing.
*  AC I'm very much a person who believes that there's always a cause, you know, there are no
*  miracles of a supernatural nature. Okay. So I mean, there are two broad categories, either
*  it's the vacuum zero point energy, or it's some sort of a new energy field that pervades the
*  universe. The latter could change with time. The former, the vacuum energy cannot. So if it turns
*  out that it's one of these new fields, and there are many, many possibilities, they go by the name
*  of quintessence and things like that. But there are many categories of those sorts of fields.
*  We try with data to rule them out by comparing the actual measurements with the predictions.
*  And some have been ruled out, but many, many others remain to be tested. And the data just
*  have to become a lot better before we can rule out most of them and become reasonably convinced
*  that this is a vacuum energy. LW So there is hypotheses for different fields,
*  with names and stuff like that. AC Yeah, generically quintessence,
*  like the Aristotelian fifth essence. But there are many, many versions of quintessence.
*  There's K-essence. There's even ideas that this isn't something from within this dark energy,
*  but rather there are a bunch of, say, bubble universes surrounding our universe. And this
*  whole idea of the multiverse is not some crazy madman type idea anymore. It's real card carrying
*  physicists are seriously considering this possibility of a multiverse. And some types
*  of multiverses could have a bunch of bubbles on the outside, which gravitationally act outward
*  on our bubble because gravity or gravitons, the quantum particle that is thought to carry gravity
*  is thought to traverse the bulk, the space between these different little bubble membranes and stuff.
*  And so it's conceivable that these other universes are pulling outward on us. That's not a favorite
*  explanation right now, but really nothing has been ruled out. No class of models has been ruled out
*  completely. Certain examples within classes of models have been ruled out. But in general,
*  I think we still have really a lot to learn about what's causing this observed acceleration of the
*  expansion of the universe, be it dark energy or some forces from the outside, or perhaps,
*  I guess it's conceivable that, and sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night screaming,
*  that dark energy, that which causes the acceleration and dark matter, that which causes
*  galaxies and clusters of galaxies to be bound gravitationally, even though there's not enough
*  visible matter to do so. Maybe these are our 20th and 21st century Ptolemaic epicycles.
*  So Ptolemy had a geocentric and Aristotelian view of the world. Everything goes around Earth.
*  But in order to explain the backward motion of planets among the stars that happens every year
*  or two, or sometimes several times a year for Mercury and Venus, you needed the planets to go
*  around in little circles called epicycles, which themselves then went around Earth.
*  AC Yes.
*  AC And in this part of the epicycle where the planet is going in the direction opposite to
*  the direction of the overall epicycle, it can appear in projection to be going backward among
*  the stars, so-called retrograde motion. And it was a brilliant mathematical scheme. In fact,
*  he could have added epicycles on top of epicycles and reproduced the observed positions of planets
*  to arbitrary accuracy. And this is really the beginning of what we now call Fourier analysis.
*  Any periodic function can be represented by a sum of sines and cosines of different periods,
*  amplitudes, and phases. So it could have worked arbitrarily well. But other data show that,
*  in fact, Earth is going around the Sun. So are dark energy and dark matter just these band-aids
*  that we now have to try to explain the data, but they're just completely wrong? That's a possibility
*  as well. And as a scientist, I have to be open to that possibility as an open-minded scientist.
*  AC How do you put yourself in the mindset of somebody that,
*  where a majority of the scientific community or majority of people believe that the Earth,
*  everything rotates around Earth, how do you put yourself in that mindset and then take a leap
*  to propose a model that the Sun is, in fact, at the center of the solar system?
*  AC Sure. So that puts us back in the shoes of Copernicus 500 years ago, where he had this
*  philosophical preference for the Sun being the dominant body in what we now call the solar system.
*  The observational evidence in terms of the measured positions of planets was not better explained by
*  the heliocentric Sun-centered system. It's just that Copernicus saw that the Sun is the source of
*  all our light and heat. He knew from other studies that it's far away, so the fact that it appears
*  as big as the Moon means it's actually way, way bigger because even at that time, it was known
*  that the Sun is much farther away than the Moon. So he just felt, wow, it's big, it's bright.
*  What if it's the central thing? But the observed positions of planets at the time
*  in the early to mid 16th century under the heliocentric system was not a better match,
*  at least not a significantly better match than Ptolemy's system, which was quite accurate and
*  lasted 1500 years. AC Yeah. That's so fascinating to think that the philosophical predispositions
*  that you bring to the table are essential. So you have to have a young person come along
*  that has a weird infatuation with the Sun. That almost philosophically is like however
*  their upbringing is, they're more ready for whatever the simpler answer is. It's kind of
*  sad. It's sad from an individual descendant of a perspective because then that means like me,
*  you as a scientist, you're stuck with whatever the heck philosophies you brought to the table.
*  You might be almost completely unable to think outside this particular box you've built.
*  AC Right. This is why I'm saying that as an objective scientist, one needs to have an open
*  mind to crazy sounding new ideas. Even Copernicus was very much a man of his time and dedicated
*  his work to the Pope. He still used circular orbits. The Sun was a little bit off center,
*  it turns out, and a slightly off center circle looks like a slightly eccentric elliptical orbit.
*  So then when Kepler in fact showed that the orbits are actually in general ellipses, not circles,
*  the reason that he needed to Cobra has really great data to show that distinction was that
*  a slightly off center circle is not much different from a slightly eccentric ellipse.
*  And so there wasn't much difference between Kepler's view and Copernicus's view and Kepler
*  needed the better data, to Cobra's data. And so that's again a great example of science
*  and observations and experiments working together with hypotheses and they kind of
*  bounce off each other. They play off of each other and you continually need more observations.
*  And it wasn't until Galileo's work around 1610 that actual evidence for the heliocentric hypothesis
*  emerged. It came in the form of Venus, the planet Venus, going through all of the possible phases
*  from new to crescent to quarter to gibbous to full to waning gibbous, third quarter waning
*  crescent and then new again. It turns out in the Ptolemaic system with Venus between Earth
*  and the Sun, but always roughly in the direction of the Sun, you could only get the new and crescent
*  phases of Venus. But the observation showed a full set of phases. And moreover, when Venus was
*  gibbous or full, that meant it was on the far side of the Sun. That meant it was farther from Earth
*  than when it's crescent. So it should appear smaller and indeed it did. So that was the nail
*  in the coffin in a sense. And then Galileo's other great observation was that Jupiter has
*  moons going around it, the four Galilean satellites. And even though Jupiter moves through space,
*  so too do the moons go with it. So first of all, Earth is not the only thing that has other things
*  going around it. And secondly, Earth could be moving as Jupiter does and things would move
*  with it. We wouldn't fly off the surface and our moon wouldn't be left behind and all this kind of
*  stuff. So that was a big breakthrough as well, but it wasn't as definitive in my opinion as the phases
*  of Venus. Perhaps I'm revealing my ignorance, but I didn't realize how much data they were working
*  with. So it wasn't Einstein or Freud thinking in theories. It was a lot of data and you're playing
*  with it and seeing how to make sense of it. So it isn't just coming up with completely abstract
*  thought experiments. It's looking at the data. Sure. And you look at Newton's great work,
*  the Principia. It was based in part on Galileo's observations of balls rolling down inclined planes,
*  supposedly falling off the Leaning Tower of Pisa, but that's probably apocryphal.
*  In any case, the Inquisition actually did, or the Roman Catholic Church, did history a favor,
*  not that I'm condoning them, but they placed Galileo under house arrest. And that gave Galileo time
*  to assemble and publish the results of his experiments that he had done decades earlier.
*  It's not clear he would have had time to do that had he not been under house arrest. And so
*  Newton, of course, very much used Galileo's observations.
*  Let me ask the old Russian overly philosophical question about death. So we're talking about the
*  expanding universe. Sure. How do you think human civilization will come to an end if we avoid the
*  near-term issues we're having? Will it be our sun burning out? Will it be comets? Oh, okay.
*  Will it be, what is it? Do you think we have a shot at reaching the heat death of the universe?
*  Yeah. So we're going to leave out the anthropogenic causes of our potential destruction,
*  which I actually think are greater than the celestial causes.
*  So if we get lucky and intelligent, I don't know.
*  Yeah. So no way will we as humans reach the heat death of the universe. I mean, it's conceivable
*  that machines, which I think will be our evolutionary descendants, might reach that,
*  although even they will have less and less energy with which to work as time progresses,
*  because eventually even the lowest mass stars burn out, although it takes them trillions of years
*  to do so. So the point is that certainly on earth, there are other celestial threats,
*  existential threats, comets, exploding stars, the sun burning out. So we will definitely need
*  to move away from our solar system to other solar systems. And then the question is,
*  can they keep on propagating to other planetary systems sufficiently long?
*  In our own solar system, the sun burning out is not the immediate existential threat.
*  That'll happen in about five billion years when it becomes a red giant. Although I should hasten
*  to add that within the next one or two billion years, the sun will have brightened enough
*  that unless there are compensatory atmospheric changes, the oceans will evaporate away.
*  And you need much less carbon dioxide for the temperatures to be maintained roughly
*  at their present temperature, and plants wouldn't like that very much. So you can't
*  lower the carbon dioxide content too much. So within one or two billion years, probably the
*  oceans will evaporate away. But on a sooner time scale than that, I would say an asteroid
*  collision leading to a potential mass extinction, or at least an extinction of complex beings such
*  as ourselves that require quite special conditions, unlike cockroaches and amoebas to survive.
*  You know, one of these civilization changing asteroids is only one kilometer or so in diameter
*  and bigger. And a true mass extinction event is 10 kilometers or larger. Now it's true that we can
*  find and track the orbits of asteroids that might be headed toward Earth. And if we find them 50 or
*  100 years before they impact us, then clever applied physicists and engineers can figure out
*  ways to deflect them. But at some point, some comet will come in from the deep freeze of the
*  solar system. And there we have very little warning, months to a year.
*  CB What's the deep freeze, Sergeant?
*  RL Oh, the deep freeze is sort of out beyond Neptune. There's this thing called the Kuiper
*  belt. And it consists of a bunch of dirty ice balls or icy dirt balls. It's the source of the
*  comets that occasionally come close to the Sun. And then there's an even bigger area called the
*  scattered disk, which is sort of a big donut surrounding the solar system way out there,
*  from which other comets come. And then there's the Oort cloud, W-O-R-T after Jan Oort, a Dutch
*  astrophysicist. And it's the better part of a light year away from the Sun, so a good fraction
*  of the distance to the nearest star. But that's like a trillion or 10 trillion
*  comet-like objects that occasionally get disturbed by a passing star or whatever,
*  and most of them go flying out of the solar system. But some go toward the Sun, and they come in with
*  little warning. By the time we can see them, they're only a year or two away from us. And moreover,
*  not only is it hard to determine their trajectories sufficiently accurately to know whether they'll hit
*  a tiny thing like Earth, but outgassing from the comet of gases when the ices sublimate,
*  that outgassing can change the trajectory just because of conservation of momentum.
*  It's the rocket effect. Gases go out in one direction, the object moves in the other
*  direction. And so since we can't predict how much outgassing there will be and in exactly
*  what direction, because these things are tumbling and rotating and stuff, it's hard to predict
*  the trajectory with sufficient accuracy to know that it will hit. And you certainly don't want to
*  deflect a comet that would have missed, but you thought it was going to hit and end up having it
*  hit. That would be like the ultimate Charlie Brown goat instead of trying to be the hero, right? He
*  ended up being the goat. What would you do if it seemed like in a matter of months that there is
*  some non-zero probability, maybe a high probability that there would be a collision?
*  From a scientific perspective, from an engineering perspective, I imagine you would actually be in the
*  room of people deciding what to do. What philosophically too.
*  It's a tough one, right? Because if you only have a few months, that's not much time in which to
*  deflect it. Early detection and early action are key. Because when it's far away, you only have to
*  deflect it by a tiny little angle. And then by the time it reaches us, the perpendicular motion is
*  big enough to miss Earth. All you need is one radius or one diameter of the Earth, right?
*  That actually means that all you would need to do is slow it down so it arrives four minutes
*  later or speed it up so it arrives four minutes earlier and Earth will have moved through one
*  radius in that time. So it doesn't take much. But you can imagine if a thing is about to hit you,
*  you have to deflect it 90 degrees or more, right? And you don't have much time to do so and you have
*  to slow it down or speed it up a lot if that's what you're trying to do to it. And so decades
*  is sufficient time, but months is not sufficient time. So at that point, I would think
*  the name of the game would be to try to predict where it would hit.
*  And if it's in a heavily populated region, try to start an orderly evacuation perhaps.
*  But that might cause just so much panic. How would you do it with New York City or Los Angeles or
*  something like that, right? I might have a different opinion a year ago. I'm a bit
*  disheartened by, you know, in the movies, there's always extreme competence from the government.
*  Competence, yeah. But we expect extreme incompetence, if anything, right?
*  Yes, now. So I'm quite disappointed. But sort of from a medical perspective, I think
*  you're saying there in a scientific one, it's almost better to get better and better,
*  maybe telescopes and data collection to be able to predict the movement of these things or like
*  come up with totally new technologies that you can imagine actually sending out like probes out
*  there to be able to sort of almost have little finger sensors throughout our solar system to
*  be able to detect stuff. Well, that's right. Yeah. Monitoring the asteroid belt is very important.
*  99% of the so-called near-Earth objects ultimately come from the asteroid belt. And so there we can
*  track the trajectories. And even if there's a close encounter between two asteroids which deflects
*  one of them toward Earth, it's unlikely to be on a collision course with Earth in the immediate
*  future. It's more like, you know, tens of years. So that gives us time. But we would need to improve
*  our ability to detect the objects that come in from a great distance. And fortunately, those are
*  are much rare. The comets come in, you know, 1% of the collisions perhaps are with comets that come
*  in without any warning hardly. And so that might be more like, you know, a billion or two billion
*  years before one of those hits us. So maybe we have to worry about the sun getting brighter
*  on that time scale. I mean, there's the possibility that a star will explode near us
*  in the next couple of billion years. But over the course of the history of life on Earth,
*  the estimates are that maybe only one of the mass extinctions, you know, was caused by a star
*  blowing up in particular, a special kind called a gamma ray burst. And I think it's the Ordovician
*  Solarian extinction 420 or so, 440 million years ago, that is speculated to have come from one of
*  these particular types of exploding stars called gamma ray bursts. But even there, the evidence is
*  circumstantial. So those kinds of existential threats are reasonably rare. The greater danger,
*  I think, is civilization changing events where it's a much smaller asteroid, which those are
*  harder to detect, or a giant solar flare that shorts out the grid in all of North America,
*  let's say. Now, astronomers are monitoring the sun 24-7 with various satellites, and we can tell
*  when there's a flare or a coronal mass ejection. And we can tell that in a day or two, a giant
*  bundle of energetic particles will arrive and twang the magnetic field of Earth and send all
*  kinds of currents through long distance power lines. And that's what shorts out the transformers.
*  And transformers are expensive and hard to replace and hard to transport and all that kind
*  of stuff. So if we can warn the power companies and they can shut down the grid before the big
*  bundle of particle hits, then we will have mitigated much of this. Now, for a big enough
*  bundle of particles, you can get short circuits even over small distance scales. So
*  not everything will be saved, but at least the whole grid might not go out. So again,
*  astronomers, I like to say, support your local astronomer. They may help someday save humanity by
*  telling the power companies to shut down the grid, finding the asteroid 50 or 100 years before it
*  hits, then having clever physicists and engineers deflect it. So many of these cosmic threats,
*  cosmic existential threats, we can actually predict and do something about or observe before
*  they hit and do something about. So- It's terrifying to think that people would listen
*  to this conversation. It's like when you listen to Bill Gates talk about pandemics in his Ted talk
*  a few years ago and realizing we should have supported our local astronomer more.
*  Well, I don't know whether it's more because as I said, I actually think human induced threats
*  or things that occur naturally on earth, either a natural pandemic or perhaps a bioengineering type
*  pandemic or something like a super volcano. There was one event, Toba, I think it was 70
*  plus thousand years ago that caused a gigantic decrease in temperatures on earth because
*  it sent up so much soot that it blocked the sun. It's the nuclear winter type disaster scenario
*  that some people including Carl Sagan talked about decades ago. But we can see in the history
*  of volcanic eruptions even more recently in the 19th century, Tambora and other ones,
*  you look at the record and you see rather large dips in temperature associated with
*  massive volcanic eruptions. Well, these super volcanoes, one of which by the way exists
*  under Yellowstone in the central US. I mean, it's not just one or two states, it's a gigantic region
*  and there's controversy as to whether it's likely to blow anytime in the next 100,000 years or so.
*  But that would be perhaps not a mass extinction because you really need to, or perhaps not a
*  complete existential threat because you have to get rid of the very last humans for that.
*  But at least getting rid of killing off so many humans, truly billions and billions of humans.
*  The one that there have been ones tens of thousands of years ago, including this one
*  Toba I think it's called, where it's estimated that the human population was down to 10,000
*  or 5,000 individuals, something like that. If you have a 15 degree drop in temperature
*  over quite a short time, it's not clear that even with today's advanced technology,
*  we would be able to adequately respond at least for the vast majority of people.
*  Maybe some would be in these underground caves where you'd keep the president and a bunch of
*  other important people, but the typical person is not going to be protected when all of agriculture
*  is cut off. It could be hundreds of millions or billions of people starving to death.
*  Exactly. That's right. They don't all die immediately, but they use up their supplies.
*  Or again, this electrical grid. First of toilet paper.
*  There you go. Dash that toilet paper. Or the electrical grid. Imagine North America without
*  power for a year. We've become so dependent. We're no longer the cave people. They would
*  do just fine. What do they care about the electrical grid? What do they care about
*  agriculture? They're hunters and gatherers. But we now have become so used to our way of life
*  that the only real survivors would be those rugged individualists who live somewhere out in
*  the forest or in a cave somewhere completely independent of anyone else.
*  Yeah. I've recently, I recommend it. It's totally new to me, this kind of survivalist folks, but
*  there's a lot of shows of those, but I saw one on Netflix and I started watching them and they
*  make a lot of sense. They reveal to you how dependent we are on all aspects of this
*  beautiful systems we humans have built and how fragile they are.
*  Incredibly fragile. This whole conversation is making me realize how lucky we are.
*  Oh, we're incredibly lucky, but we've set ourselves up to be very, very fragile. And
*  we are intrinsically complex biological creatures that, except for the fact that we have brains and
*  minds with which we can try to prevent some of these things or respond to them, we as a
*  living organism require quite a narrow set of conditions in order to survive. We're not
*  cockroaches. We're not going to survive a nuclear war.
*  So we're kind of this, this beautiful dance between, um, we've been talking about astronomy
*  that astronomy, the stars like inspires everybody. And at the same time, there's this pragmatic
*  aspect that we're talking about. And so I see space exploration as the same kind of way
*  that it's, uh, reaching out to other planets, reaching out to the stars, this really beautiful
*  idea. But if you listen to somebody like Elon Musk, he talks about space exploration
*  as very pragmatic. Like we have to, uh, if we, we have to be,
*  he has this ridiculous way of sounding like an engineer about it, which is like,
*  it's obvious we need to become a multi-planetary species if we were to survive longterm. So maybe
*  both philosophically in terms of beauty and in terms of practical, what's your thoughts on, um,
*  space exploration on the challenges of it, on how much we should be investing in it. And on a
*  personal level, like how excited you are by the possibility of going to Mars, colonizing Mars,
*  and maybe going outside the solar system. Yeah. Yeah. Great question. Uh, there's a lot to unpack
*  there. Humans are by their very nature, explorers, pioneers. They want to go out,
*  climb the next mountain, see what's behind it, um, explore the ocean depths, explore space.
*  This is our destiny to go out there. And, and of course, from a pragmatic perspective, yes, we need
*  to, uh, plant our seeds elsewhere really, because things could go wrong here on earth. Now some
*  people say that's, that's an excuse to not take care of our planet that, well, we say we're
*  elsewhere and so we don't have to take good care of our planet. No, you know, we should take
*  the best possible care of our planet. We should be cognizant of the potential impact of what we're
*  doing. Nevertheless, it's prudent to have us be elsewhere as well. So in that regard, I actually
*  agree with Elon. Uh, it'd be good to be on Mars. That would be yet another place for us to, from
*  which to, you know, explore further. Would that be a good next step? Well, that's the good,
*  it's a good next step. I have to happen. I happen to disagree with him as to how quickly it will
*  happen. Right. I mean, I think he's very optimistic. Now you need visionary people like Elon to, to get
*  people going and to inspire them. I mean, look at the success he's had with multiple companies.
*  So maybe he gives this very optimistic timeline in order to be inspirational to those who are,
*  who are going out there and certainly his success with, you know, the rocket that
*  is reusable cause it landed upright and all that. I mean, you know what, that's a game changer.
*  It's sort of like every time you flew from San Francisco to Los Angeles, you discard the airplane.
*  Right. I mean, that's crazy. Right. So that's a game changer, but nevertheless, the time scale
*  over which he thinks that there could be a real thriving colony on Mars, I think is far too
*  optimistic. What's the biggest challenges to you? One is just getting rockets, not rockets,
*  but people out there. And two is the colonization. Yeah. What do you have thoughts about this?
*  Challenges of this kind of prospect. Yeah. I haven't thought about it in great detail
*  other than recognizing that Mars is a harsh environment. Yeah. You don't have much of an
*  atmosphere there. You've got less than a percent of earth's atmosphere. So you'd need to build
*  some sort of a dome right away. Right. And that would take time. You need to melt the water that's
*  in the permafrost or have canals dug from which you transport it from the polar ice camps. You know,
*  I was reading recently in terms of like, what's the most efficient source of nutrition for humans
*  that were to live on Mars. And people should look into this, but it turns out to be insects.
*  Yeah. So you want to build giant colonies of insects and just be eating them. Insects have
*  a lot of protein. A lot of protein. And they're easy to grow. You can think of them as farming.
*  Right. But it's not going to be as easy as growing a whole plot of potatoes like in the movie,
*  The Martian or something, right? It's not going to be that easy. But you know, so there's this
*  thin atmosphere. It's got the wrong composition. It's mostly carbon dioxide. There are these violent
*  dust storms. The temperatures are generally cold. You know, you'd need to do a lot of things. You
*  need to terraform it basically in order to make it nicely livable without some dome surrounding
*  you. And if you insist on a dome, well, that's not going to house that many people, right?
*  So let's look briefly then. You know, we're looking for a new apartment to move into.
*  Let's look outside the solar system. Do you think you've spoken about exoplanets as well?
*  Do you think there's possible homes out there for us outside of our solar system?
*  There are lots and lots of homes, possible homes. I mean, there's a planetary system around nearly
*  every star you see in the sky. And one in five of those is thought to have a roughly Earth-like
*  planet. And that's a relatively new discovery. I mean, the Kepler satellite, which was flying
*  around above Earth's atmosphere, was able to monitor the brightness of stars with exquisite
*  detail. And they could detect planets crossing the line of sight between us and the star,
*  thereby dimming its light for a short time, ever so slightly. And it's amazing. So there are now
*  thousands and thousands of these exoplanet candidates of which something like 90% are
*  probably genuine exoplanets. And you have to remember that only about 1% of stars have their
*  planetary system-oriented edge on to your line of sight, which is what you need for this transit
*  method to work, right? Some arbitrary angle won't work and certainly perpendicular to your line of
*  sight. That is, in the plane of the sky won't work because the planet is orbiting the star and
*  never crossing your line of sight. So the fact that they found planets orbiting about 1% of the
*  stars that they looked at in this field of 150 plus thousand stars, they found planets around
*  1%. You then multiply by the inverse of 1%, which is, right, 1% is about the fraction of the
*  stars that have their planetary system oriented the right way. And that already, back of the
*  interval calculation, tells you that of order 50 to 100% of all stars have planets, okay? And then
*  they've been finding these Earth-like planets, et cetera, et cetera. So there are many potential
*  homes. The problem is getting there, okay? So then a typical bright star, Sirius, the brightest star
*  in the sky, maybe not a typical bright star, but it's 8.7 light years away, okay? So that means the
*  light took 8.7 years to reach us. We're seeing it as it was about nine years ago, okay? So then you
*  ask, how long would a rocket take to get there at Earth's escape speed, which is 11 kilometers per
*  second, okay? And it turns out it's about a quarter of a million years, okay? Now that's 10,000
*  generations, okay? Let's say a generation of humans is 25 years, right? So you'd need this colony
*  of people that is able to sustain itself, all their food, all their waste disposal, all their water,
*  all their recycling of everything. For 10,000 generations, they have to commit themselves
*  to living on this vehicle, right? I just don't see it happening. What I see potentially happening,
*  if we avoid self-destruction, intentional or unintentional here on Earth, is that machines
*  will do it, robots that can essentially hibernate. They don't need to do much of anything for a long,
*  long time as they're traveling. And moreover, if some energetic charged particle, some cosmic ray
*  hits the circuitry, it fixes itself, right? Machines can do this. I mean, it's a form of
*  artificial intelligence. You just tell the thing, fix yourself basically. And then when you land on
*  the planet, start producing copies of yourself, initially from materials that perhaps sent,
*  or you just have a bunch of copies there. And then they set up factories with which to do this. I
*  mean, this is very, very futuristic, but it's much more feasible, I think, than sending flesh and
*  blood over interstellar distances, a quarter of a million years to even the nearest stars.
*  You're subject to all kinds of charged particles and radiation. You have to shield yourself really
*  well. That's, by the way, one of the problems of going to Mars is that it's not a three-day
*  journey like going to the moon. You're out there for the better part of a year or two, and you're
*  exposed to lots of radiation, which typically doesn't do well with living tissue, right?
*  Or living tissue doesn't do well with the radiation. And then the hope is that the robots,
*  the AI systems might be able to carry the fire of consciousness or whatever makes us humans,
*  like a little drop of whatever makes us humans so special, not to be too poetic about it.
*  But I like being poetic about it because it's an amazing question. Is there something beyond just
*  the bits, the ones and zeros to us? It's an interesting question. I like to think that
*  there isn't anything and that how beautiful it is that our thoughts, our emotions, our feelings,
*  our compassion all come from these ones and zeros, right? That to me actually is a beautiful
*  thought. And the idea that machines, silicon-based life effectively could be our natural evolutionary
*  descendants, not from a DNA perspective, but they are our creations and they then carry on.
*  That to me is a beautiful thought in some ways, but others find it to be a horrific thought.
*  So that's exciting to you. It is exciting to me as well because to me from a purely
*  an engineering perspective, I believe it's impossible to create, like whatever
*  systems we create that take over the world, it's impossible for me to imagine that those
*  systems will not carry some aspect of what makes humans beautiful. So a lot of people
*  have these kind of paperclip ideas that will build machines that are cold inside or philosophers
*  call them zombies. That naturally the systems that will outcompete us on this earth will be cold and
*  non-conscious, not capable of all the human emotions and empathy and compassion and love
*  and hate, the beautiful mix of what makes us human. But to me, intelligence requires all of that.
*  So in order to outcompete humans, you better be good at the full picture.
*  Right. So artificial general intelligence in my view encompasses a lot of these attributes
*  that you just talked about. Curiosity, inquisitiveness, right?
*  It might look very different than us humans, but it will have some of the magic.
*  But it'll also be much more able to survive the onslaught of existential threats that either we
*  bring upon ourselves or don't anticipate here on earth or that occasionally come from beyond. And
*  there's nothing much we can do about a supernova explosion that just suddenly goes off. And really,
*  if we want to move to other planets outside our solar system, I think realistically that's a much
*  better option than thinking that humans will actually make these gigantic journeys.
*  And then I do this calculation from my class. Einstein's special theory of relativity says
*  that you can do it in a short amount of time in your own frame of reference if you go close to
*  the speed of light. But then you bring in E equals MC squared and you figure out how much energy it
*  takes to get you accelerated to close enough to the speed of light to make the time scales short
*  in your own frame of reference. And the amount of energy is just unfathomable. We can do it at the
*  Large Hadron Collider with protons. We can accelerate them to 99.9999% of the speed of light,
*  but that's just a proton. We're gazillions of protons, okay? And that doesn't even count
*  the rocket that would carry us the payload. And you would need to either store the fuel in the
*  rocket, which then requires even more mass for the rocket, or collect fuel along the way,
*  which is difficult. And so getting close to the speed of light, I think, is not an option either
*  other than for a little tiny thing like Yuri Milner and others are thinking about this
*  star shot project where they'll send a little tiny camera to Alpha Centauri 4.2 light years away.
*  They'll zip past it, take a picture of the exoplanets that we know orbit that three or
*  more star system and- Say hello real quick. Say hello real quickly and then send the images back
*  to us, okay? So that's a tiny little thing, right? Maybe you can accelerate that to, they're hoping,
*  20% of the speed of light with a whole bunch of high-powered lasers aimed at it. It's not clear
*  that other countries will allow us to do that, by the way. But that's a very forward-looking
*  thought. I very much support the idea, but there's a big difference between sending a little tiny
*  camera and sending a payload of people with equipment that could then mine the resources
*  on the exoplanet that they reach and then go forth and multiply, right?
*  LW Well, let's talk about the big galactic things and how we might be able to leverage them to
*  travel fast. I know this is a little bit science fiction, but ideas of wormholes and
*  the ideas at the edge of black holes that reveal to us that this fabric of space-time
*  could be messed with, perhaps? Is that at all an interesting thing for you? I mean,
*  in looking out at the universe and studying it as you have, is that also a possible dream for you
*  to find clues on how we can actually use it to improve our transportation?
*  AC It's an interesting thought. I'm certainly excited by the potential physics that suggest
*  this kind of faster-than-light travel effectively, or cutting the distance to make it very, very
*  short through a wormhole or something like that. LW Possible? No?
*  AC Well, call me not very imaginative, but based on today's knowledge of physics,
*  which I realize people have gone down that rabbit hole. A century ago, Lord Kelvin,
*  one of the greatest physicists of all time, said that all of fundamental physics is done,
*  the rest is just engineering. And guess what? Then came special relativity, quantum physics,
*  general relativity, how wrong he was. So let me not be another Lord Kelvin. On the other hand,
*  I think we know a lot more now about what we know and what we don't know and what the physical
*  limitations are. And to me, most of these schemes, if not all of them, seem very far-fetched,
*  if not impossible. So travel through wormholes, for example. It appears that for a non-rotating
*  black hole, that's just a complete no-go because the singularity is a point-like singularity,
*  and you have to reach it to traverse the wormhole, and you get squished by the singularity.
*  Now for a rotating black hole, it turns out there is a way to pass through the event horizon,
*  the boundary of the black hole, and avoid the singularity and go out the other side, or even
*  traverse the donut hole-like singularity. In the case of a rotating black hole, it's a ring
*  singularity. So there's actually two theoretical ways you could get through a rotating black hole
*  or a charged black hole, not that we expect charged black holes to exist in nature because
*  they would quickly bring in the opposite charge so as to neutralize themselves.
*  But rotating black holes, definitely a reality. We now have good evidence for them. Do they have
*  traversable wormholes? Probably not because it's still the case that when you go in, you go in with
*  so much energy that it either squeezes the wormhole shut or you encounter a whole bunch of incoming and
*  outgoing energy that vaporizes you. It's called the mass inflation instability, and it just
*  vaporizes you. Nevertheless, you could imagine, well, you're in some vapor form, but if you make
*  it through, maybe you could reform or something. So it's still information.
*  Yeah, it's still information. It's scrambled information, but there's a way maybe of bringing
*  it back, right? But then the thing that really bothers me is that as soon as you have this
*  possibility of traversal of a wormhole, you have to come to grips with a fundamental problem,
*  and that is that you could come back to your universe at a time prior to your leaving,
*  and you could essentially prevent your grandparents from ever meeting. This is called the grandfather
*  paradox, right? And if they never met, and if your parents were never born, and if you were never
*  how would you have made the journey to prevent the history from allowing you to exist, right?
*  It's a violation of causality, of cause and effect. Now, physicists such as myself take
*  causality violation very, very seriously. We've never seen it.
*  You took a stand.
*  Yeah, I mean, it's one of these right back to the future type movies, right? And you have to work
*  things out in such a way that you don't mess things up, right? Some people say that, well,
*  you come back to the universe, but you come back in such a way that you cannot affect your journey.
*  But then, I mean, that seems kind of contrived to me, or some say that you end up in a different
*  universe, and this also goes into the many different types of the multiverse hypothesis,
*  and the many worlds interpretation, and all that. But again, then it's not the universe from which
*  you left, right? And you don't come back to the universe from which you left. And so,
*  you're not really going back in time to the same universe, and you're not even going forward in
*  time necessarily then to the same universe, right? You're ending up in some other universe.
*  So, what have you achieved, right?
*  You've traveled.
*  You've traveled.
*  You ended up in a different place than you started in more ways than one.
*  Yeah, and then there's this idea, the Alcubierre Drive, where you warp space-time in front of you
*  so as to greatly reduce the distance, and you can expand the space-time behind you.
*  So, you're sort of riding a wave through space-time. But the problem I see with that,
*  beyond the practical difficulties and the energy requirements, and by the way, how do you get out
*  of this bubble through which you're riding this wave of space-time? And Miguel Alcubierre
*  acknowledged all these things. He said, this is purely theoretical, fanciful, and all that. But
*  a fundamental problem I see is that you'd have to get to those places in front of you
*  so as to change the shape of space-time, so as to make the journey quickly. But to get there,
*  you got there in the normal way at a speed considerably less than that of light.
*  So, in a sense, you haven't saved any time, right? You might as well have just
*  taken that journey and gotten to where you were going.
*  What have you done? It's not like you snap your fingers and say,
*  okay, let that space there be compressed, and then I'll make it over to Alpha Centauri
*  in the next month. You can't snap your fingers and do that.
*  LW Yeah, but yeah, we're sort of assuming that we can fix all the biological stuff that requires
*  for humans to persist through that whole process because ultimately it might boil down to just
*  extending the life of the human in some form, whether it's through the robot, through the
*  digital form, or actually just figuring out genetically how to live forever. Because that
*  journey that you mentioned, the long journey, might be different if somehow our understanding
*  of genetics, our understanding of our own biology, all that kind of stuff would... That's another
*  trajectory that possibly... LW Well, right. If you could put us into some sort of suspended
*  animation, hibernation or something, and greatly increase the lifetime. And so these 10,000
*  generations I talked about, what do they care? It's just one generation and they're asleep.
*  LW Yeah, just a long nap. LW So then you can do it. It's still not easy,
*  right? Because you've got some big old huge colony and that just through E equals MC squared, right?
*  That's a lot of mass. That's a lot of stuff to accelerate. The Newtonian kinetic energy is
*  gigantic, right? So you're still not home free, but at least you're not trying to do it in a short
*  amount of clock time, right? Which if you look at E equals MC squared, requires truly unfathomable
*  amounts of energy because the energy is sort of... It's your rest mass, M not C squared,
*  divided by the square root of one minus V squared over C squared. And if your listeners want to just
*  stick into their pocket calculator as V over C approaches one, that one over the square root of
*  one minus V squared over C squared approaches infinity. So if you wanted to do it in zero time,
*  you'd need an infinite amount of energy. That's basically why you can't reach, let alone exceed
*  the speed of light for a particle moving through a pre-existing space. It's that it takes an infinite
*  amount of energy to do so. So that's talking about us going somewhere. What about...
*  One of the things that inspires a lot of folks, including myself, is the possibility that there's
*  other... That this conversation is happening on another planet in different forms with
*  intelligent life forms. Well, first we could start... As a cosmologist, what's your intuition
*  about whether there is or isn't intelligent life out there, outside of our own?
*  Yeah. I would say I'm one of the pessimists in that I don't necessarily think that we're the only
*  ones in the observable universe, which goes out roughly 14 billion years in light travel time and
*  more like 46 billion years when you take into account the expansion of space. So the diameter
*  of our observable universe is something like 90, 92 billion light years. That encompasses
*  100 billion to a trillion galaxies with 100 billion stars each. So now you're talking about
*  something like 10 to the 22nd, 10 to the 23rd power stars and roughly an equal number of
*  Earth-like planets and so on. So there may well be other intelligent life.
*  But your sense is our galaxy is not teeming with life.
*  Yeah. Our galaxy, our Milky Way galaxy with several hundred billion stars and potentially
*  habitable planets is not teeming with intelligent life.
*  Intelligent.
*  Well, I'll get to the primitive life, the bacteria in a moment. But we may well be the only ones in
*  our Milky Way galaxy, at most a handful I'd say, but I'd probably side with the school of thought
*  that suggests we're the only ones in our own galaxy just because I don't see human intelligence
*  as being a natural evolutionary path for life. I mean, there's a number of arguments. First of
*  all, there's been more than 10 billion species of life on Earth in its history. Nothing has
*  approached our level of intelligence and mechanical ability and curiosity.
*  Whales and dolphins appear to be reasonably intelligent, but there's no evidence that they
*  can think abstract thoughts that they're curious about the world. They certainly can't build
*  machines with which to study the world. So that's one argument. Secondly, we came about
*  as early hominids only four or five million years ago and as homo sapiens only about a
*  quarter of a million years ago. So for the vast majority of the history of life on Earth,
*  an intelligent alien zipping by Earth would have said there's nothing particularly intelligent
*  or mechanically able on Earth. Thirdly, it's not clear that our intelligence is a long-term
*  evolutionary advantage. Now it's clear that in the last 100 years, 200 years, we've improved the lives
*  of millions, hundreds of millions of people, but at the risk of potentially destroying ourselves,
*  either intentionally or unintentionally or through neglect as we discussed before.
*  That's a really interesting point, which is it's possible that there's a huge amount of
*  intelligent civilizations have been born even through our galaxy, but they live very briefly
*  and they die. Flash bulbs in the night. That brings me to the fourth issue, and that is the
*  Fermi paradox. If they're common, where the hell are they? Notwithstanding the various UFO reports
*  in Roswell and all that, they just don't meet the bar. They don't clear the bar of scientific
*  evidence in my opinion. So there's no clear evidence that they've ever visited us on Earth
*  here. And SETI has been now, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence has been scanning
*  the skies. And true, we've only looked a couple of hundred light years out and that's a tiny
*  fraction of the whole galaxy, a tiny fraction of these hundred billion plus stars. Nevertheless,
*  if the galaxy were teeming with life, especially intelligent life, you'd expect some of it to have
*  been far more advanced than ours. There's nothing special about when the industrial revolution
*  started on Earth. The chemical evolution of our galaxy was such that billions of years ago,
*  nuclear processing and stars had built up clouds of gas after their explosion that were rich enough
*  in heavy elements to have formed Earth-like planets, even billions of years ago. So there
*  could be civilizations that are billions of years ahead of ours. And if you look at the exponential
*  growth of technology among Homo sapiens in the last couple of hundred years, and you just project
*  that forward, there's no telling what they could have achieved even in 1,000 or 10,000 years, let
*  alone a million or 10 million or a billion years. And if they reach this capability of interstellar
*  travel and colonization, then you can show that within 10 million years or certainly 100 million
*  years, you can populate the whole galaxy. So then you don't have to have tried to detect them beyond
*  a hundred or a thousand light years. They would already be here. Do you think as a thought
*  experiment, do you think it's possible that they are already here, but we humans are so human-centric
*  that we're just not like our conception of what intelligent life looks like.
*  Yeah.
*  We don't want to acknowledge it. Like what if trees?
*  Right. Right, right. Yeah.
*  Okay. I guess in the form of a question, do you think we'll actually detect
*  intelligent life if it came to visit us?
*  Yeah. I mean, it's like, you're an ant crawling around on a sidewalk somewhere. And do you notice
*  the humans wandering around? Exactly.
*  And the empire state building and rocket ships flying to the moon and all that kind of stuff.
*  Right. It's conceivable that we haven't detected it and that we're so primitive compared to them
*  that we're just not able to do so. Like if you look at dark energy, maybe we call it as a field.
*  It's just that my own feeling is that in science now through observations and experiments,
*  we've measured so many things and basically we understand a lot of stuff.
*  Fabric of reality.
*  Yeah. The fabric of reality we understand quite well. And there are a few little things like dark
*  matter and dark energy that may be some sign of some super intelligence, but I doubt it. Okay.
*  Why would some super intelligence be holding clusters of galaxies together? Why would they be
*  responsible for accelerating the expansion of the universe? So the point is that through science
*  and applied science and engineering, we understand so much now that I'm not saying we know everything,
*  but we know a hell of a lot. Okay. And so it's not like there are lots of mysteries flying around
*  there that are completely outside our level of exploration or understanding.
*  Yeah. I would say from the mystery perspective, it seems like the mystery of our own cognition
*  and consciousness is much grander than like the degrees of freedom of possible explanations
*  of what the heck is going on is much greater there than in the physics of the observer.
*  How the brain works. How did life arise? Yeah. Big, big questions. But they to me don't indicate
*  the existence of an alien or something. I mean, unless we are the aliens, we could have been
*  contamination from some rocket ship that hit here a long, long time ago and all evidence of it has
*  been destroyed. But again, that alien would have started out somewhere. They're not here watching us
*  right now. Right? They're not among us. And so though there are potential explanations for the
*  Fermi paradox, and one of them that I kind of like is that the truly intelligent creatures are those
*  that decided not to colonize the whole galaxy because they'd quickly run out of room there
*  because it's exponential. Right? You send a probe to a planet, it makes two copies. They go out,
*  they make two copies each and it's an exponential. Right? They quickly colonize the whole galaxy.
*  But then the distance to the next galaxy, the next big one like Andromeda, that's two and a half
*  million light years. That's a much grander scale now. Right? And so it also could be that the reason
*  they survived this long is that they got over this tendency that may well exist among sufficiently
*  intelligent creatures, this tendency for aggression and self-destruction. Right? If they bypass that,
*  and that may be one of the great filters if there are more than one, right? Then they may not be
*  a type of creature that feels the need to go and say, oh, there's a nice looking planet.
*  And there's a bunch of ants on it. Let's go squish them and colonize it. No, it could even be the
*  kind of Star Trek-like prime directive where you go and explore worlds, but you don't interfere
*  in any way. Right? And also we call it exploration is beautiful and everything, but there is
*  underlying this desire to explore is a desire to conquer. I mean, if we're just being really honest.
*  Right now for us it is. Right. And you're saying it's possible to separate, but I would venture
*  to say that those are coupled. So I could imagine a civilization that lives on for billions of years
*  that just stays on us, like figures out the minimal effort way of just peacefully existing.
*  It's like a monastery. Yeah. And it limits itself. Yeah. It limits itself. You know, it's planted
*  its seeds in a number of places. So it's not vulnerable to a single point failure. Right?
*  Supernova going off near one of these stars or something, or an asteroid, or a comet coming in
*  from the Oort cloud equivalent of that planetary system and without warning, you know, thrashing
*  them to bits. So they've got their seeds in a bunch of places, but they chose not to colonize
*  the galaxy. And they also choose not to interfere with this incredibly prevalent primitive organism,
*  homo sapiens. Right. Or they, this is like a, they enjoy, this is like a TV show for them.
*  Yeah. It could be like a TV show. Right. So they just tuned in. Right. So those are possible
*  explanations. Yet I think that to me, the most likely explanation for the Fermi paradox is that
*  they really are very, very rare. And you know, Carl Sagan estimated a hundred thousand of them.
*  If there's that many, some of them would have been way ahead of us. And I think we would have
*  seen them by now. If there are a handful, maybe they're there. But at that point,
*  you're right on this dividing line between being a pessimist and an optimist.
*  And what are the odds for that? Right. If you look at all the things that had to go right for us.
*  And then, you know, getting back to something you said earlier, let's discuss, you know, primitive
*  life. Yeah. That could be the thing that's difficult to achieve. Just getting the random
*  molecules together to a point where they start self-replicating and evolving and becoming better
*  and all that. That's an inordinately difficult thing, I think, though I'm not, you know, some
*  molecular cell biologist, but just it's, it's, it's the usual argument. You know, you're wandering
*  around in the Sahara Desert and you stumble across a watch. Is your, is your initial response,
*  oh, you know, a bunch of sand grains just came together randomly and formed this watch. No,
*  you, you think that something formed it or it came from some simpler structure that then became,
*  you know, more complex. All right. It didn't just form. Well, even the simplest life is,
*  is a very, very complex structure. Even the, even the simplest prokaryotic cells, not to mention
*  eukaryotic cells, although that transition may have been the so-called great filter as well. Maybe
*  the cells without a nucleus are relatively easy to form. And then the big next step is where you
*  have a nucleus, which then provides a lot of energy, which allows the cell to become much,
*  much more complex and so on. Interestingly, going from eukaryotic cells, single cells to
*  multicellular organisms does not appear to be at least on earth. One of these great filters,
*  because there's evidence that it happened dozens of times independently on earth. So by,
*  by a really great filter, something that happens very, very rarely, I mean that we had to get through
*  an obstacle that is just incredibly rare to get through.
*  And one of the really exciting scientific things is that that particular point
*  is something that we might be able to discover, even in our lifetimes,
*  that find life elsewhere, like Europa or be able to see that would be bad news.
*  Right. Cause if we find lots of pretty advanced life, that would suggest,
*  and especially if we found some, you know, defunct, you know, fossilized civilization or
*  something somewhere else, that would be- Oh, bacteria, you mean? Of like defunct civilization
*  of like primitive lifeforms. Oh, no, I'm sorry. I switched gears there. If we found some intelligent
*  or rather, you know, even trilobites, right? And stuff, you know, elsewhere, that would be bad
*  news for us because that would mean that the great filter is ahead of us, you know, right?
*  Oh, interesting. Because it would mean that lots of, lots of things have gotten roughly to our level.
*  Yeah. But given the Fermi paradox, if you accept that the Fermi paradox
*  means that there's no one else out there, you don't necessarily have to accept that. But
*  if you accept that it means that no one else is out there, and yet there are lots of things we've
*  found that are at or roughly at our level, that means that the great filter is ahead of us. And
*  that bodes poorly for our long-term future. You know, it's funny you said, you started
*  by saying you're a little bit on the pessimistic side, but it's funny because we're doing this
*  dance between pessimism and optimism because I'm not sure if us being alone in the observable
*  universe as intelligent beings is pessimistic. Well, it's good news in a sense for us.
*  Because it means that we made it through. Oh, right. See, if we're the only ones,
*  and there are such great filters, maybe more than one, formation of life might be one of them.
*  Formation of eukaryotic that is with the nucleus cells be another. Development of human-like
*  intelligence might be another, right? There might be several such filters, and we were the lucky
*  ones. And then people say, well, then that means you're putting yourself into a special perspective.
*  And every time we've done that, we've been wrong. And yeah, yeah, I know all those arguments. But
*  it still could be the case that there's one of us, at least per galaxy or per 10 or 100 or 1000
*  galaxies, and we're sitting here having this conversation because we exist. And so there's
*  an observational selection effect there, right? Just because we're special doesn't mean that we
*  shouldn't have these conversations about whether or not we're special, right?
*  Yeah. So that's exciting. That's optimistic. So that's the optimistic part that if we don't find
*  other intelligent life there, it might mean that we're the ones that made it.
*  And in general, outside the great filter and so on, it's not obvious that the Stephen Hawking
*  thing, which is it's not obvious that life out there is going to be kind to us.
*  Oh, yeah. So I knew Hawking and I greatly respect his scientific work and in particular,
*  the early work on the unification of general theory of relativity and quantum physics to two
*  great pillars of modern physics, Hawking radiation and all that. Fantastic work.
*  If you were alive, you should have been a recipient of this year's Physics Nobel Prize,
*  which was for the discovery of black holes and also by Roger Penrose for the theoretical work
*  showing that given a star that's massive enough, you basically can't avoid having a black hole.
*  Anyway, Hawking, fantastic. I tip my hat to him. May he rest in peace.
*  That would have been a heck of a Nobel Prize. Black holes.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  But going back to what he said that we shouldn't be broadcasting our presence to others,
*  there I actually disagree with him respectfully because,
*  first of all, we've been unintentionally broadcasting our presence for 100 years
*  since the development of radio and TV. Secondly, any alien that has the capability of coming here
*  and squashing us either already knows about us and doesn't care because we're just like little
*  ants. When there are ants in your kitchen, you tend to squash them. But if there are ants on
*  the sidewalk and you're walking by, do you feel some great conviction that you have to squash any
*  of them? No, you generally don't. We're irrelevant to them. All they need to do is keep an eye on us
*  to see whether we're approaching the kind of technological capability and know about them
*  and have intentions of attacking them, and then they can squash us. They could have done it long
*  ago. They'll do it if they want to. Whether we advertise our presence or not is irrelevant.
*  I really think that that's not a huge existential threat.
*  This is a good place to bring up a difficult topic. You mentioned
*  that they would be paying attention to us to see if we come up with any crazy technology.
*  There's folks who have reported UFO sightings. I've recently found out there's
*  websites that track the data of these reportings, and there's millions of them in the past
*  several decades, seven decades and so on, that they've been recorded.
*  The UFOlogist community, as they refer to themselves, one of the ideas that I find compelling
*  from an alien perspective is that they started showing up ever since we figured out how to build
*  nuclear weapons. What a coincidence. If I was an alien, I would start showing up then as well.
*  Why not just observe us from afar? I know. I would figure out, but that's why I'm always
*  keeping a distance and staying blurry. Very pixelated.
*  Very pixelated. There is something in the human condition, a cognition that wants to see,
*  wants to believe beautiful things. Some are terrifying. Some are exciting. Goats. Bigfoot
*  is a big fascination for folks. UFO sightings, I think, falls into that. There's people that
*  look at lights in the night sky. It's kind of a downer to think in a skeptical sense,
*  to think that's just the light. You want to feel like there's something magical there.
*  I felt that first when my dad, my dad's a physicist, when he first told me about ball lightning,
*  when I was a little kid. Very weird.
*  Very weird physical phenomena. He said, his intuition was, tell me this as a little kid,
*  I really like math. His intuition was, whoever figures out ball lightning will get a Nobel Prize.
*  I think that was a side comment he gave me. I decided there when I was five years old or
*  whatever, I'm going to win a Nobel Prize for figuring out ball lightning. That was one of the
*  first sparks of the scientific mindset. Those mysteries, they capture your imagination. I think
*  when I speak to people that report UFOs, that fire, that's what I see. That excitement.
*  I understand that.
*  What do we do with that? Because there's hundreds of thousands, if not millions,
*  and then the scientific community, you're like the perfect person. You have an awesome Einstein
*  shirt. What do we do with those reports? Most of the scientific community kind of rolls their eyes
*  and dismisses it. Is it possible that a tiny percent of those folks saw something that's worth
*  deeply investigating?
*  Sure. We should investigate it. It's just one of these things where they've not brought us a hunk
*  of kryptonite or something like that. They haven't brought us actual, tangible physical evidence with
*  which experiments can be done in laboratories. It's anecdotal evidence. The photographs are
*  in some cases, in most cases, I would say quite ambiguous.
*  I don't know what to think about. David Faber is the first person. He's a Navy pilot commander,
*  and there's a bunch of them, but he's one of the most legit pilots and people I've ever met.
*  The fact that he saw something weird, he doesn't know what the heck it is,
*  but he saw something weird. I don't know what to do with that.
*  On the psychological side, I'm pretty confident he saw what he says he saw, which he's saying
*  is something weird. One of the interesting psychological things that worries me is that
*  everybody in the Navy, everybody in the US government, everybody in the scientific community
*  just pretended that nothing happened. That kind of instinct, that's what makes me believe if
*  aliens show up, we would all just ignore their presence. That's what bothered me, that you don't
*  investigate it more carefully and use this opportunity to inspire the world.
*  Like, so in terms of kryptonite, I think the conspiracy theory folks
*  say that whenever there is some good hard evidence that scientists will be excited about,
*  there's this kind of conspiracy that I don't like because it's ultimately negative,
*  that the US government will somehow hide the good evidence to protect it. Of course, there's some
*  legitimacy to it because you want to protect military secrets, all that kind of stuff.
*  I don't know what to do with this beautiful mess because I think millions of people are inspired
*  by UFOs. It feels like an opportunity to inspire people about science.
*  So I would say, as Carl Sagan used to say, extraordinary claims require extraordinary
*  evidence. I've quoted him a number of times. We would welcome such evidence. On the other hand,
*  a lot of the things that are seen or perhaps even hidden from us, you could imagine for military
*  purposes, surveillance purposes, the US government doesn't want us to know, or maybe some of these
*  pilots saw Soviet or Israeli or whatever satellites. Some of the crashes that have occurred
*  were later found to be weather balloons or whatever. When there are more conventional
*  explanations, science tends to stay away from the sensational ones. It may be that someone else is
*  calling in life is to investigate these phenomena. I welcome that as a scientist.
*  I don't categorically actually deny the possibility that ships of some sort could have visited us
*  because, as I said earlier, at slow speeds, there's no problem in reaching other stars. In fact,
*  our Voyager and Pioneer spacecraft in a few million years are going to be in the vicinity
*  of different stars. We can even calculate which ones they're going to be in the vicinity of.
*  Right? There's nothing that breaks any laws of physics if you do it slowly, but that's different.
*  Just having Voyager or Pioneer fly by some star, that's different from having active aliens
*  altering the trajectory of their vehicle in real time, spying on us, and then either zipping back
*  to their home planet or sending signals that tell them about us because they are likely many light
*  years away and they're not going to have broken that barrier as well. Go ahead, study them. Great.
*  For some young kid who wants to do it, it might be their calling. That's how they might find
*  meaning in their lives is to be the scientist who really explores these things. I chose not to
*  because at a very young age, I found the evidence to the degree that I investigated it to be really
*  quite unconvincing and I had other things that I wanted to do. But I don't categorically deny
*  the possibility and I think it should be investigated. Yeah. I mean, this is one of
*  those phenomena that 99.9% of people are almost definitely, there's conventional explanations,
*  and then there's mysterious things that probably have explanations that are a little bit more
*  complicated, but there's not enough to work with. I tend to believe that if aliens showed up,
*  there will be plenty of evidence for scientists to study. Exactly, as you said,
*  avoid your type of spacecraft. I could see some kind of a dumb thing, almost like a sensor to
*  probing, statistically speaking. Flying by. Flying by, maybe lands, maybe there's some kind of robot
*  type of thingies that just move around and so on in ways that we don't understand. But I feel like,
*  I feel like there'll be plenty of hard to dismiss evidence. And I also, especially this year,
*  believe that the US government is not sufficiently competent, given the huge amount of evidence that
*  will be revealed from this kind of thing to conceal all of it. At least in modern times,
*  you can say maybe decades ago, but in modern times. But the people I speak to and the reason
*  I bring it up is because so many people write to me, they're inspired by it.
*  By the way, I wanted to comment on something you said earlier. Yeah, I had said that I'm sort of a
*  pessimist in that I think there are very few other intelligent, mechanically able creatures out there.
*  But then I said, yes, in a sense, I'm an optimist, as you pointed out, because it means that we made
*  it through the great filter. I meant originally that I'm a pessimist in that I'm pessimistic about
*  the possibility that there are many, many of us out there.
*  You know, mathematically speaking, in the Drake equation.
*  Exactly, right, right. But it may mean a good thing for our ultimate survival. So I'm glad
*  you caught me on that. Yeah, I definitely agree with you. It is ultimately an optimistic statement.
*  But anyway, I think UFO research is interesting. And I guess one of the reasons I've not
*  been terribly convinced is that I think there are some scientists who are investigating this,
*  and they've not found any clear evidence. Now, I must admit I have not looked through the literature
*  to convince myself that there are many scientists doing systematic studies of these various reports.
*  So I can't say for sure that there's a critical mass of them. But it's just that you never get
*  these reports from hardcore scientists. That's the other thing. And astronomers, you know,
*  what do we do? We spend our time studying the heavens and you'd think we'd be the ones that
*  are most likely, aside from pilots perhaps, at seeing weird things in the sky. And we just
*  never do of the unexplained UFO type nature. Yeah, I definitely I try to keep an open mind.
*  But for people who listen, it's actually really difficult for scientists. Like I get probably,
*  like this year, I've probably gotten over, probably maybe, maybe over a thousand emails
*  on the topic of AGI. It's very difficult to, you know, people write to me is like, how can you ignore
*  this in AGI side, like this model, this is obviously the model that's going to achieve general
*  intelligence. How can you ignore it? I'm giving you the answer. Here's my document. And there's
*  always just these large write ups. The problem is, it's very difficult to weed through a bunch of BS.
*  It's very possible that you actually saw the UFO, but you have to acknowledge
*  by UFO, I mean an extraterrestrial life. You have to acknowledge the hundreds of thousands of people
*  who are a little bit, if not a lot, full of BS. And from a scientist perspective,
*  it just, it's really hard work. And it's when there's amazing stuff out there, it's like,
*  why invest in Bigfoot when evolution and all of its richness is beautiful? Who cares about a monkey
*  that walks on two feet or eight or whatever? In a sense, it's like there's a zillion decoys
*  at observatories. True fact, we get lots and lots of phone calls when Venus, the evening star,
*  but just really a bright planet happens to be close to the crescent moon because it's such a
*  striking pair. This happens once in a while. So we get these phone calls, oh, there's a UFO
*  next to the moon. And no, it's Venus. And so they're just, and I'm not saying the best UFO
*  reports are of that nature. No, there are some much more convincing cases and I've seen some
*  of the footage and blah, blah, blah. But it's just, there's so many decoys, right? So much,
*  so much noise that you have to filter out. And there's only so many scientists, so it's hard.
*  There's only so much time as well. And you have to choose what problems you work on.
*  This might be a fun question to ask to kind of explore the idea of the expanding universe.
*  So the radius of the observable universe is 45.7 billion light years. And the age of the universe
*  is 13.7 billion years. That's less than the radius of the universe. How's that possible?
*  That's a great question. I meant to bring a little prop I have with ping pong balls on a rubber hose,
*  a rubber band. I use it in many of the lectures that one can find of me online. But you have
*  in an expanding universe, the space itself between galaxies or more correctly, clusters of galaxies
*  expanding. So imagine light going from one cluster to another. It traverses some distance.
*  And then while it's traversing the rest, that part that it already traveled through
*  continues to expand. Now, 13.7 billion years might have gone by since the light that we are seeing
*  from the early stages, the so-called cosmic microwave background radiation, which is the
*  afterglow of the Big Bang or the echo of the Big Bang. Yeah, 13.7 billion years have gone by. That's
*  how long it's taken that light to reach us. But while it's been traveling that distance,
*  the parts that it already traveled continue to expand. So it's like you're walking at an airport
*  on one of these walkways and you're walking along because you're trying to get to your terminal.
*  But the walkway is continuing as well. You end up traveling a greater distance or the same distance
*  faster is another way of putting it. That's why you get on one of these traveling walkways.
*  So you get roughly a factor of pi, but it's more like 3.2, I think. But when you work it all out,
*  you multiply the number of years the universe has been in existence by three and a quarter or so.
*  And that's how you get this 46 billion light year radius.
*  AC But how is that? Let me ask some nice dumb questions. How is that not traveling faster than
*  the speed of light? Yeah, it's not traveling faster than the speed of light because locally,
*  at any point, if you were to measure the light, the photon zipping past, it would not be exceeding
*  the speed of light. The speed of light is a locally measured quantity. After light has traversed some
*  distance, if the rubber band keeps on stretching, then yes, it looks like the light traveled a
*  greater distance than it would have had the space not been expanding. But locally, it never was
*  exceeding the speed of light. It's just that the distance through which it already traveled then
*  went off and expanded on its own some more. And if you give the light credit, so to speak, for having
*  traversed that distance, well, then it looks like it's going faster than the speed of light.
*  AC But that's not how speed works. AC Right. That's not how speed works. And in relativity,
*  also, the other thing that is interesting is that if you take two ping pong balls that are
*  sufficiently far apart, especially in an accelerating universe, you can easily have them
*  moving apart from one another faster than the speed of light. So take two ping pong balls that
*  were originally 400,000 kilometers from each other and let every centimeter in your rubber band
*  expand to two in one second. Then suddenly, this 400,000 kilometer distance is 800,000 kilometers.
*  It went out by 400,000 kilometers in one second. That exceeds the 300,000 kilometer per second
*  speed of light. But that particle limit in special relativity applies to objects moving
*  through a pre-existing space. There's nothing in either special or general relativity that prevents
*  space itself from expanding faster than the speed of light. That's no problem. Einstein wouldn't
*  have had a problem with a universe as observed now by cosmologists. AC Yeah. I'm not sure
*  yet ready to deal emotionally with expanding space. That to me is one of the most awe-inspiring
*  things, starting from the Big Bang. AC That's definitely abstract.
*  AC Space itself is expanding. Could you talk about the Big Bang a little bit?
*  AC Sure. Yeah, yeah. AC So the entirety of it,
*  the universe was very small. AC Right. But it was not a point.
*  AC It was not a point. AC Because if we live in what's called
*  a closed universe now, a sphere or the three-dimensional version of that would be a
*  hypersphere, then regardless of how far back in time you go, it was always that topological shape.
*  You can't turn a point suddenly into a shell. It always had to be a shell.
*  So when people say, well, the universe started out as a point, that's being kind of flippant,
*  kind of glib. It didn't really. It just started out at a very high density.
*  And we don't know actually whether it was finite or infinite. I think personally that it was finite
*  at the time, but it expanded very, very quickly. Indeed, if it exponentiated and continued in some
*  places to exponentiate, then it could in fact be infinite right now. And most cosmologists think
*  that it is infinite. AC Wait, sorry. Infinite in which dimension? Mass, size?
*  AC Infinite in space. And by that I mean that if you were trying to measure, use light to measure
*  its size, you'd never be able to measure its size because it would always be bigger than the distance
*  light can travel. That's what you get in a universe that's accelerating in its expansion.
*  AC Okay. But if a thing was a hypersphere, it's very small, not a point.
*  How can that thing be infinite? AC Well, it expands exponentially. That's what
*  the inflation theory is all about. Indeed, at your home institution, Alan Guth is one of the originators
*  of the whole inflationary universe idea, along with Andre Linde at Stanford University here in
*  the Bay Area. And others, Alexei Starobinsky and others had similar sorts of ideas. But
*  in an exponentially expanding universe, if you actually try to make this measurement,
*  you send light out to try to see it curve back around and hit you in the back of the head.
*  If it's an exponentially expanding universe, the amount of space remaining to be traversed
*  is always a bigger and bigger quantity. So you'll never get there from here. You'll never reach the
*  back of your head. So observationally or operationally, it can be thought of as being infinite.
*  AC Infinite. That's one of the best definitions of infinity, by the way.
*  That's one of the best sort of physical manifestations of infinity.
*  AC Yeah, yeah, because you have to ask how would you actually measure it?
*  Now, I sometimes say to my cosmology theoretical friends, well, if I were God and I were outside
*  this whole thing, and I took a God-like slice in time, wouldn't it be finite no matter how big it
*  is? And they object and they say, Alex, you can't be outside and take a God-like slice of time.
*  AC Because there's nothing outside.
*  AC Well, I'm not, you know, or also, you know, what slice of time you're taking depends on your
*  motion. And that's true even in special relativity that slices of time get tilted in a sense if you're
*  moving quickly, the axes, X and T actually become tilted, not perpendicular to one another.
*  And, you know, you can look at Brian Greene's books and lectures and other things where
*  he imagines taking a loaf of bread and slicing it in units of time as you progress forward.
*  But then if you're zipping along relative to that loaf of bread, the slices of time actually become
*  tilted. And so it's not even clear what slices of time mean. But I'm an observational astronomer.
*  I know which end of the telescope to look through. And the way I understand the infinity is,
*  as I just told you, that operationally or observationally, there'd be no way of seeing
*  that it's a finite universe, of measuring a finite universe. And so in that sense,
*  it's infinite, even if it started out as a finite little dot. Not a dot, I'm sorry, a finite little
*  hypersphere. But it didn't really start out there because what happened before that?
*  Well, we don't know. So this is where it gets into a lot of speculation.
*  Let's go there. Okay, sure. So, you know, nobody can prove you wrong.
*  What happened before T equals zero and whether there are other universes out there.
*  I like to say that these are sort of on the boundaries of science. They're not just ideas
*  that we wake up at three in the morning to go to the bathroom and say, oh, well, let's think about
*  what happened before the Big Bang or let there be a multiplicity of universes. In other words,
*  we have real testable physics that we can use to draw certain conclusions that are
*  plausibility arguments based on what we know. Now, admittedly, there are not really direct tests of
*  these hypotheses. That's why I call them hypotheses. They're not really elevated to
*  a theory because a theory in science is really something that has a lot of
*  experimental or observational support behind it. So they're hypotheses, but they're not
*  unreasonable hypotheses based on what you know about general relativity and quantum physics.
*  And they may have indirect tests in that if you adopt this hypothesis, then there might be a
*  bunch of things you expect of the universe and lo and behold, that's what we measure.
*  But we're not actually measuring anything at T less than zero or we're not actually measuring
*  the presence of another universe in this multiverse. And yet there are these indirect ideas that stem
*  forth. So it's hard to prove uniqueness and it's hard to completely convince oneself that
*  a certain hypothesis must be true. But the more and more tests you have that it satisfies,
*  let's say there are 50 predictions it makes and 49 of them are things that you can measure.
*  And then the 50th one is the one where you want to measure the actual existence of that other
*  universe or what happened before T equals zero. And you can't do that. But you've satisfied 49
*  of the other testable predictions. And so that's science. Now, a conventional condensed matter
*  physicist or someone who deals with real data in the laboratory might say, oh, you cosmologists,
*  that's not really science because it's not directly testable. But I would say it's sort
*  of testable, but it's not completely testable. And so it's at the boundary. But it's not like
*  we're coming up with these crazy ideas among them quantum fluctuations out of nothing and then
*  inflating into a universe with, you might say, well, you created a giant amount of energy. But
*  in fact, this quantum fluctuation out of nothing in a quantum way violates the conservation of
*  energy. But who cares? That was a classical law anyway. And then an inflating universe maintains
*  whatever energy it had, be it zero or some infinitesimal amount. In a sense, the stuff
*  of the universe has a positive energy, but there's a negative gravitational energy associated with it.
*  Like I drop an apple, I got kinetic energy, energy of motion out of that, but I did work on it to
*  bring it to that height. So by going down and gaining energy of motion, positive one, two,
*  three, four, five units of kinetic energy, it's also gaining or losing, depending on how you want
*  to think of it, negative one, two, three, four, five units of potential energy. So the total energy
*  remains the same. An inflating universe can do that. Or other physicists say that energy
*  isn't conserved in general relativity. That's another way out of creating a universe out of
*  nothing. But the point is that this is all based on reasonably well-tested physics. And although these
*  extrapolations seem kind of outrageous at first, they're not completely outrageous. They're within
*  the realm of what we call science already. And maybe some young whippersnapper will be able to
*  figure out a way to directly test what happened before t equals zero or to test for the presence
*  of these other universes. But right now we don't have a way of doing that.
*  So speaking of young whippersnappers, Roger Penrose. So he kind of has an idea that there
*  might be some information that travels from whatever the heck happened before the big bang.
*  Yeah. Maybe. I kind of doubt it.
*  So do you think it's possible to detect something, like actually experimentally be able to detect some,
*  I don't know what it is, radiation, some sort of-
*  Yeah, in the cosmic microwave background radiation, there may be ways of doing that.
*  But is it philosophically or practically possible to detect signs that this was before the big bang?
*  Or is it what you said, which is like everything we observe will,
*  as we currently understand, will have to be a creation of this particular observable universe?
*  Yeah. I mean, it's very difficult to answer right now because we don't have a single,
*  verified, fully self-consistent, experimentally tested quantum theory of gravity.
*  Right. And of course,
*  the beginning of the universe is a large amount of stuff in a very small space.
*  Yeah. So you need both quantum mechanics
*  and general relativity. Same thing if our universe recollapses and then bounces back to another big
*  bang. There's also ideas there that some of the information leaks through or survives.
*  I don't know that we can answer that question right now because we don't have a quantum theory
*  of gravity that most physicists believe in. And belief is perhaps the wrong word, that most
*  physicists trust because the experimental evidence favors it. There are various forms of string
*  theory, there's quantum loop gravity, there are various ideas, but which if any will be the one
*  that survives the test of time and more importantly, within that, the test of experiment
*  and observation. So my own feeling is probably these things don't survive. I don't think we've
*  seen any evidence in the cosmic microwave background radiation of information leaking through.
*  Similarly, one of the few ways in which we might test for the presence of other universes is if
*  they were to collide with ours, that would leave a pattern, a temperature signature in the cosmic
*  microwave background radiation. Some astrophysicists claim to have found it, but in my opinion,
*  it's not statistically significant to the level that would be necessary to have such an amazing
*  claim. It's just a 5% chance that the microwave background had that distribution just by chance.
*  5% isn't very long odds if you're claiming that instead that you're finding evidence from another
*  universe. I mean, it's like if the Large Hadron Collider people had claimed
*  after gathering enough data to show the Higgs particle when there was a 5% chance it could be
*  just a statistical fluctuation in their data. No, they required five sigma, five standard
*  deviations, which is roughly one chance in two million that this is a statistical fluctuation
*  of no physical greater significance. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.
*  There you go. It all boils down to that. And the greater your claim, the greater is the evidence
*  that is needed and the more evidence you need from independent ways of measuring or of coming
*  to that deduction. A good example was the accelerating universe when we found evidence for
*  it in 1998 with supernovae with exploding stars. It was great that there were two teams that
*  lent some credibility to the discovery, but it was not until other astrophysicists used not only that
*  technique, but more importantly, other independent techniques that had their own potential sources of
*  systematic error or whatever, but they all came to the same conclusion. And that started giving
*  a much more complete picture of what was going on and a picture in which most astrophysicists
*  quickly gained confidence. That's why that idea caught on so quickly is that there were other
*  physicists and astronomers doing observations completely independent of supernovae
*  that seemed to indicate the same thing. Yeah. That period of your life that work
*  with an incredible team of people that won the Nobel Prize is just fascinating work.
*  Gosh, never in my wildest dreams as a kid did I think that I would be involved,
*  much less so heavily involved, in a discovery that's so revolutionary. As a kid, as a scientist,
*  if you're realistic, once you learn a little bit more about how science is done and you're not
*  going to win a Nobel Prize and be the next Newton or Einstein or whatever, you just hope that you'll
*  contribute something to humankind's understanding of how nature works and you'll be satisfied with
*  that. But here I was in the right place at the right time, a lot of luck, a lot of hard work,
*  and there it was. We discovered something that was really amazing and that was the greatest thrill.
*  I couldn't have asked for anything more than being involved in that discovery.
*  The couple of teams, the Supernova Cosmology Project and the High Z Supernova Search Team,
*  what was the Nobel Prize given for? It was given for the discovery of the
*  accelerating expansion of the universe. Not for the elucidation of what dark energy is
*  or what causes that expansion, that acceleration, be it universes on the outside or whatever.
*  It was only for the observational fact. First of all, what is the accelerating universe?
*  The accelerating universe is simply that if we look at the galaxies moving away from us right now,
*  we would expect them to be moving away more slowly than they were billions of years ago.
*  And that's because galaxies have visible matter, which is gravitationally attractive,
*  and dark matter of an unknown sort that holds galaxies together and holds clusters of galaxies
*  together. And of course, they then pull on one another and they would tend to retard the expansion
*  of the universe, just as when I toss an apple up, even ignoring air resistance, the mutual
*  gravitational attraction between Earth and the apple slows the apple down. And if that attraction
*  is great enough, then the apple will someday stop and even come back. The Big Crunch, you could call
*  it, or the Gnabgib, which is Big Bang backwards. That's what could have happened to the universe.
*  But even if the universe's original expansion energy was so great that it avoids the Big Crunch,
*  that's like an apple thrown at Earth's escape speed. It's like the rockets that go to Mars
*  someday with people. Even then, you'd expect the universe to be slowing down with time.
*  But we looked back through the history of the universe by looking at progressively more distant
*  galaxies and by seeing that the evolution of this expansion rate is that in the first 9 billion years,
*  yeah, it was slowing down. But in the last 5 billion years, it's been speeding up. So who
*  asked for that, right? I think it's interesting to talk about a little bit of the human story
*  of the Nobel Prize. Sure. Which is fascinating. First of all, the prize itself, it's kind of
*  fascinating on the psychological level that prizes, I know we kind of think that prizes don't matter,
*  but somehow they kind of focus the mind about some of the most special things we've accomplished.
*  The recognition, the funding. And also inspiration for you. Like I said, when I was a little kid,
*  they gave me the Nobel Prize. It inspires millions of young scientists. At the same time,
*  there's a sadness to it a little bit that especially in the field, depending on the field,
*  but experimental fields that involve teams of, I don't know, sometimes hundreds of brilliant people.
*  The Nobel Prize is only given to just a handful. Is it maxed at three?
*  Yeah. And it's not even written in Alfred Nobel's will, it turns out. One of our teammates looked
*  into it in a museum in Stockholm when we went there for Nobel week in 2011. The leaders who
*  got the prize formally knew that without the rest of us working hard in the trenches, the result
*  would not have been discovered. So they invited us to participate in Nobel week. And so one of the
*  team members looked in the will and it's not there. It's just tradition. That's interesting.
*  It's archaic. That's the way science used to be done. And it's not the way a lot of science
*  is done now. And you look at gravitational wave discovery, which was recognized with the Nobel
*  Prize in 2017, Ray Weiss at MIT got it and Kip Thorne and Barry Barish at Caltech. And Ron
*  Drever, one of the masterminds had passed away earlier in the year. So again, one of the rules
*  on Nobel is that it's not given posthumously, or at least the one exception might be if they've made
*  their decision and they're busy making their press releases right before October, the first week in
*  October or whatever, and then the person passes away. I think they don't change their minds then.
*  But yeah, it doesn't square with today's reality that a lot of science is done by big teams,
*  in that case, a team of a thousand people. In our case, it was two teams consisting of about 50
*  people. And we used techniques that were arguably developed in part by people, astrophysicists who
*  weren't even on those two papers. I mean, some of them were, but other papers were written by
*  other people. And so it's like we're standing on the shoulders of giants. And none of those people
*  was officially recognized. And to me, it was okay. Again, it was the thrill of doing the work. And
*  ultimately the work, the discovery was recognized with the prize. And we got to participate in Nobel
*  week. And it's okay with me. I've known other physicists whose lives were ruined because they
*  did not get the Nobel prize and they felt strongly that they should have. Ralph Alpher of the Alpher,
*  Beta, Gamoff paper predicting the microwave background radiation, he should have gotten it.
*  His advisor Gamoff was dead by that point, but Penzias and Wilson got it for the discovery. And
*  Alpher, apparently from colleagues who knew him well, I've talked to them, his life was ruined
*  by this. He just, it just not at his innards so much. It's very possible that in a small handful
*  of people, even three, that you would be one of the Nobel, one of the winners of the Nobel prize.
*  That doesn't weigh heavy on you? Well, you know, there were the two team leaders, Saul Perlmutter
*  and Brian Schmidt, and usually it's the team leaders that are recognized. And then Adam Reese
*  was my postdoc. He was- First author, I guess. Yeah, first author. I was second author of that
*  paper. Yeah. So I was his direct mentor at the time, although he was one of these people who just
*  runs with things. He was an MIT undergraduate by the way, Harvard graduate student, and then a
*  postdoc as a so-called Miller fellow for basic research and science at Berkeley, something that
*  I was back in 84 to 86. But you're largely a free agent, but he worked quite closely with me and he
*  came to Berkeley to work with me and on Schmidt's team, he was charged with analyzing the data and
*  he measured the brightnesses of these distant supernovae showing that they're fainter and
*  thus more distant than anticipated. And that led to this conclusion that the universe had to
*  have accelerated in order to push them out to such great distances. And I was shocked when he showed
*  me the data, the results of his calculations and measurements. But it's very- So he deserved it.
*  On Saul's team, Gerson Goldhaber deserved it, but he died I think a year earlier in 2010,
*  but that would have been four. And me, well, I was on both teams, but was I number four, five, six,
*  seven? I don't know. Well, it's also very- So if I were to- It's possible that you're- I mean,
*  I could make a very good case for you're in the three. And does that-
*  You're kind, you know. But is that psychologically-
*  Listen, it weighs on me a little bit because I don't know what to do with that. Perhaps it
*  should motivate the rethinking. Time Magazine started doing Person of the Year and they would
*  start doing concepts and almost like the Black Hole gets the Nobel Prize or I think Cellular
*  Universe gets the Nobel Prize and here's the list of people. So like the Oscar that you could say-
*  It's a team effort now. It should be redone. And the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics,
*  which was started by Yuri Milner and Zuckerberg is involved in others as well.
*  They recognized the larger team. Yeah, they recognized teams. And so in fact,
*  both teams in the Accelerating Universe were recognized with the Breakthrough Prize in 2015.
*  Nevertheless, the same three people, Reese, Perlmutter and Schmidt got the red carpet
*  rolled out for them and were at the big ceremony and shared half of the prize money. And the rest
*  of us, roughly 50, shared the other half and didn't get to go to the ceremony. But I feel for them.
*  I mean, for the Gravitational Waves, it was a thousand people. What are they going to do?
*  Invite everyone? For the Higgs particle, it was 68,000 physicists and engineers. In fact,
*  because of the whole issue of who gets it, experimentally that discovery still has not
*  been recognized. The theoretical work by Peter Higgs and Angler got recognized, but there was
*  a troika of other people who perhaps wrote the most complete paper and they were left out.
*  Another guy died. It's all of this heartbreaking. Some people argue that the
*  Nobel Prize has been diluted to because if you look at Roger Penrose, you can make an argument
*  that he should get the prize by himself. Could have and should have. Perhaps he should have
*  perhaps gotten it with Hawking before Hawking's death. The problem was Hawking radiation had not
*  been detected, but you could argue that Hawking made enough other fundamental contributions to
*  the theoretical study of black holes and the observed data were already good enough at the
*  time before Hawking's death. The latest results by Reinhard Genzel's group is that they see
*  the time dilation effect of a star that's passing very close to the black hole in the middle of our
*  galaxy. That's cool and it adds additional evidence, but hardly anyone doubted the existence
*  of the supermassive black hole and Andrea Ghez's group, I believe, hadn't yet shown that
*  relativistic effect and yet she got part of the prize as well. So clearly it was given for the
*  original evidence that was really good and that evidence is at least a decade old.
*  So one could make the case for Hawking. One could make the case that in 2016 when
*  Major and K. Lowes won the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the first exoplanet, 51B Pegasi,
*  well, there was a fellow at Penn State, Alex Woleshaw, who in 1992, three years preceding 1995,
*  found a planet orbiting a pulsar, a very weird kind of star, a neutron star, and that wouldn't
*  have been a normal planet, sure. And so the Nobel committee, they gave it for the discovery of
*  planets around normal, sun-like stars, but hell, Woleshaw found a planet so they could have given
*  it to him as the third person instead of to Jim Peebles for the development of what's called
*  physical cosmology. He's at Princeton, he deserved it, but they could have given Nobel for the
*  development of physical cosmology to Peebles and I would claim some other people were pretty
*  important in that development as well. And they could have given it some other year.
*  So there's a lot of controversy. I try not to dwell on it, was I number three? Probably not.
*  Adam Reese did the work. I helped bounce ideas off of him, but we wouldn't have had the result
*  without him. And I was on both teams for reasons, I mean, the style of the first team, the supernova
*  cosmology project didn't match mine. They came largely from experimental high energy particle
*  physics where there's these hierarchical teams and stuff and it's hard for the little guy to
*  have a say, at least that's what I kind of thought. Whereas the team of astronomers led by Brian Schmitt
*  was first of all, a bunch of my friends and they grew up as astronomers making contributions on
*  little teams and we decided to band together, but all of us had our voices heard. So it was sort of
*  a culture, a style that I preferred really. But let me tell you a story. At the Nobel banquet,
*  I'm sitting there between two physicists who are members of the committee of the Swedish National
*  Academy of Sciences. And I strategically kept offering them wine and stuff during this long
*  drawn out Nobel ceremony. And I got them to be pretty talkative. And then in a polite diplomatic
*  way, I started asking them pointed questions. And basically they admitted that if there are four or
*  more people equally deserving, they wait for one of them to die or they just don't give the prize
*  at all. And it's unclear who the three are, at least unclear to them, but unclear to them,
*  they're not even right part of the time. I mean, Jocelyn Bell discovered pulsars with a radio
*  antennas, a set of radio antennas that her advisor, Anthony Hewish, conceived and built,
*  so he deserves some credit, but he didn't discover the pulsar. She did. And his initial reaction
*  to the data that she showed him was a condescending rubbish, my dear. Yeah, I'm not kidding.
*  Now I know Jocelyn Bell and she did not let this destroy her life. She won every other prize under
*  the sun. Okay. Vera Rubin, arguably one of the discoverers of dark matter, although there,
*  if you look at the history, there were a number of people, that was the issue. I think there were a
*  number of people, four or more, who had similar data and similar ideas at about the same time.
*  Rubin won every prize under the sun. The new big large-scale survey telescope being built in Chile
*  is being renamed the Vera Rubin Telescope, because she passed away in December of 2015, I think.
*  It'll conduct this survey, large-scale survey, with the Rubin Telescope. So she's been recognized,
*  but never with the Nobel Prize. And I would say that to her credit,
*  she did not let that consume her life either. And perhaps it was a bit easier because there
*  had been no Nobel given for the discovery of dark matter. Whereas in the case of pulsars
*  and Jocelyn Bell, there was a prize given for the discovery of the freaking pulsars.
*  Yeah.
*  And she didn't get it. What a travesty of justice.
*  So I also think, as a fan of fiction, as a fan of stories, that the travesty and the tragedy and
*  the unfairness and the tension of it is what makes the prize and similar prizes beautiful.
*  The decisions of other humans that result in dreams being broken. That's why we love the Olympics.
*  There's so many athletes give their whole life for this particular moment. And then there's
*  referee decisions and little slips of here and there, the little misfortunes that destroy entire
*  dreams. It's weird to say, but it feels like that makes the entirety of it even more special.
*  If it was perfect, it wouldn't be interesting.
*  Humans like competition and they like heroes. And unfortunately, it gives the impression to
*  youngsters today that science is still done by white men with gray beards wearing white lab coats.
*  And I'm very pleased to see that this year, Andrea Ghez, the fourth woman in the history
*  of the physics prize to have received it. And then two women, one at Berkeley, one elsewhere,
*  won the Nobel Prize in chemistry without any male co-recipient. And so that's sending a message,
*  I think, to girls that they can do science and they have role models. I think the breakthrough
*  prize and other such prizes show that teams get recognized as well. And if you pay attention to
*  the newspapers, most of the good authors like Dennis Overbye of the New York Times and others
*  said that these were teams of people and they emphasize that and they all played a role.
*  And maybe if some grad student hadn't soldered some circuit, maybe the whole thing wouldn't
*  have worked. But still, Ray Weiss and Kip Thorne was the theoretical impetus for the
*  whole search for gravitational waves. Barry Barish brought the MIT and Caltech teams together to get
*  them to cooperate at a time when the project was nearly dead from what I understand and
*  contributed greatly to the experimental setup as well. He's a great experimental physicist,
*  but he was really good at bringing these two teams together instead of having them duke it out and
*  blows and leaving both of them bleeding and dying. The National Science Foundation was going to cut
*  the funding from what I understand. So there's human drama involved in this whole thing.
*  And the Olympics, yeah, a runner or a swimmer, a runner, they slip just at the moment they were
*  taking off from the first thing and that cost them some fraction of a second and that's it.
*  They didn't win. And in that case, the coaches, the families, which I met a lot of Olympic
*  athletes and the coaches and the families of the athletes are really the winners of the medals.
*  Yeah. But they don't get the medal. And it's, you know, credit assignment is a fascinating thing.
*  I mean, that's the full human story. Well, yeah. And outside of prizes, it's fascinating. I mean,
*  just to be in the middle of it for artificial intelligence, there's a field of deep learning
*  that's really exciting and people have been, there's yet another award, the Turing Award given for
*  deep learning to three folks who are very much responsible for the field. But so are a lot of
*  others. And there's a fellow by the name of Schmidt Huber who sort of symbolizes the
*  forgotten folks in the deep learning community. But, you know, that's the unfortunate,
*  sad thing. We remember Isaac Newton, we remember these special figures and the ones that flew
*  close to them, we forget. Well, that's right. And, you know, often the breakthroughs were made
*  based on the body of knowledge that had been assimilated prior to that. But, you know, again,
*  people like to worship heroes. You mentioned the Oscars earlier and, you know, you look at the
*  direct, I mean, well, I mean, okay, directors and stuff sometimes get awards and stuff. But,
*  you know, you look at even something like, I don't know, songwriters, musicians, Elton John
*  or something, right? Bernie Taupin, right? Wrote many of the words or he's not as well known or
*  the Beatles or something like that. I was hard broken to learn that Elvis didn't write most of
*  his songs. Yeah, Elvis, that's right. There you go. But he was the king, right? And he had such a
*  personality and it was such a performer, right? But it's the unsung heroes in many cases. Yeah.
*  So maybe taking a step back, we talked about the Nobel Prize for the Accelerating Universe, but
*  your work and the ideas around supernova were important in detecting this accelerating universe.
*  Can we go to the very basics of what is this beautiful, mysterious object of a supernova?
*  Right. So a supernova is an exploding star. Most stars die a relatively quiet death, our own sun
*  will, despite the fact that it'll become a red giant and incinerate Earth. It'll do that
*  reasonably slowly. But there's a small minority of stars that end their lives in a titanic explosion.
*  And that's not only exciting to watch from afar, but it's critical to our existence because it is
*  in these explosions that the heavy elements synthesize through nuclear reactions during
*  the normal course of the star's evolution and during the explosion itself get ejected into the
*  cosmos, making them available as raw material for new stars, planets, and ultimately life. And that's
*  just a great story, the best in some ways. So we like to study these things and our origins,
*  but it turns out these are incredibly useful beacons as well. Because if you know how powerful
*  an exploding star really is by measuring the apparent brightness at its peak in galaxies
*  whose distances we already know through having made other measurements, and you can thus calibrate
*  how powerful the thing really is, and then you find ones that are much more distant, then you can
*  use their observed brightness compared with their true intrinsic power or luminosity to judge their
*  distance and hence the distance of the galaxy in which they're located. It's like looking at,
*  let me just give this one analogy. You judge the distance of an oncoming car at night by looking
*  at how bright its headlights appear to be, and you've calibrated how bright the headlights are
*  of a car that's two or three meters away of known distance. And you go, oh, that's a faint
*  headlight, and so that's pretty far away. You also use the apparent angular separation between
*  the two headlights as a consistency check in your brain, but that's what your brain is doing.
*  So we can do that for cars. We can do that for stars. Nice. I like that. But with cars,
*  the headlights are all, there's some variation, but they're somewhat similar, so you can make
*  those kinds of conclusions. How much variation is there between supernova that you can detect them?
*  Right. So first of all, there are several different ways that stars can explode,
*  and it depends on their mass and whether they're in a binary system and things like that.
*  And the ones that we used for these cosmological purposes studying the expansion of the history
*  of the universe are the so-called type Roman numeral one, lowercase a, type 1a supernovae.
*  They come from a weird type of a star called a white dwarf. Our own sun will turn into a
*  white dwarf in about seven billion years. It'll have about half its present mass compressed into
*  a volume just the size of earth, so that's an inordinate density. Okay. It's incredibly dense.
*  And the matter is what's called by quantum physicists degenerate matter,
*  not because it's morally reprehensible or anything like that, but this is just the name that quantum
*  physicists give to electrons that are squeezed into a very tight space. The electrons take on
*  a motion due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and also due to the Pauli exclusion principle
*  that electrons don't like to be in the same place. They like to avoid each other. So those two things
*  mean that a lot of electrons are moving very rapidly, which gives the star an extra pressure
*  far above the thermal pressure associated with just the random motions of particles inside the
*  star. So it's a weird type of star, but normally it wouldn't explode and our sun won't explode,
*  except that if such a white dwarf is in a pair with another more or less normal star,
*  it can steal material from that normal star until it gets to an unstable limit, roughly
*  one and a half times the mass of our sun, 1.4 or so. This is known as the Chandrasekhar limit
*  after Subramanyan Chandrasekhar, an Indian astrophysicist who figured this out when he
*  was about 20 years old on a voyage from India to England where he was to be educated. Then he did
*  this and then 50 years later, he won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1984 largely for this work
*  that he did as a youngster who was on his way to be educated. Oh, and his advisor,
*  the great Arthur Eddington in England, who had done a lot of great things and was a great
*  astrophysicist. Nevertheless, he too was human and had his faults. He ridiculed Chandra's scientific
*  work at a conference in England. Most of us, if we had been Chandra, would have just given up
*  astrophysics at that time when the great Arthur Eddington ridicules our work. That's another
*  inspirational story for the youngster. Just keep going. But anyway,
*  Ignore your advisors. Yeah, no matter what your advisor says. Or don't always pay attention to
*  your advisor. Don't lose hope if you really think you're on to something. That doesn't mean never
*  listen to your advisor. They may have sage advice as well. But anyway, when a white dwarf grows to
*  a certain mass, it becomes unstable. One of the ways it can end its life is to go through a
*  thermonuclear runaway. Basically, the carbon nuclei inside the white dwarf starts fusing
*  together to form heavier nuclei. The energy that those fusion reactions emit doesn't go into
*  being dissipated out of the star or whatever or expanding it the way. If you take a blowtorch
*  to the middle of the sun, you heat up its gases, the gases would expand and cool. But this degenerate
*  star can't expand and cool. The energy pumped in through these fusion reactions goes into making
*  the nuclei move faster. That gets more of them sufficiently close together that they can undergo
*  nuclear fusion, thereby releasing more energy that goes into speeding up more nuclei. Thus,
*  you have a runaway, a bomb, an uncontrolled nuclear fusion reactor instead of the controlled
*  fusion, which is what our sun does. Our sun is a marvelous controlled fusion reactor. This is what
*  we need here on earth, fusion energy to solve our energy crisis. But the sun holds the stuff in
*  through gravity and you need a big mass to do that. This uncontrolled fusion reaction blows up a star
*  that's pretty much the same in all cases. You measure it to be almost the same in all cases,
*  but the devil is in the details. In fact, we observe them to not be all the same.
*  Theoretically, they might not be all the same because the rate of the fusion reactions might
*  depend on the amount of trace heavier elements in the white dwarf. That could depend on how old it
*  is, whether it was born billions of years ago when there weren't many heavier elements or
*  whether it's a relatively young white dwarf and all kinds of other things. Part of my work was to
*  show that indeed, not all the type 1As are the same. You have to be careful when you use them.
*  You have to calibrate them. They're not standard candles the way it just, if all headlights or all
*  candles were the same lumens or whatever, you'd say they're standard and then it would be relative.
*  Standard candles is an awesome term. Okay.
*  Standard candles is what astronomers like to say, but I don't like that.
*  There aren't any standard candles, but there are standardizable candles.
*  By looking at these type 1A- Oh, calibrate them. That's what you mean.
*  Yeah, you calibrate them. Standardizable, calibrateable. You look at enough of them
*  in nearby galaxies whose distances you know independently. What you can tell is that,
*  this is something that a colleague of mine, Mark Phillips, did who was on Schmidt's team
*  and arguably was one of the people who deserved the Nobel Prize. He showed that the intrinsically
*  more powerful type 1As decline in brightness and it turns out rise in brightness as well,
*  more slowly than the less luminous 1As. If you calibrate this by measuring a whole bunch of
*  nearby ones and then you look at a distant one, instead of saying, well, it's a 100 watt type
*  1A supernova, they're much more powerful than that by the way, plus or minus 50, you can say, no,
*  it's 112 plus or minus 15 or it's 84 plus or minus 17. It tells you where it is in the power scale
*  and it greatly decreases the uncertainties and that's what makes these things cosmologically useful.
*  I showed that if you spread the light out into a spectrum, you can tell spectroscopically that
*  these things are different as well. In 1991, I happened to study two of the extreme peculiar
*  ones, the low luminosity ones and the high luminosity ones, 1991BG and 1991T. This showed
*  that not all the 1As are the same and indeed, at the time of 1991, I was a little bit skeptical
*  that we could use type 1As because of this diversity that I was observing.
*  But in 1993, Mark Phillips wrote a paper that showed this correlation between the light curve,
*  the brightness versus time and the peak luminosity.
*  Which gives you enough information to calibrate.
*  Yeah, then they become calibrateable and that was a game changer.
*  How many type 1As are out there to use for data?
*  Now, there are thousands of them. But at the time, the high Z team had 16 and the
*  supernova cosmology project had 40, but the 16 were better measured than the 40. And so,
*  our statistical uncertainties were comparable if you look at the two papers that were published.
*  How does that make you feel that there's these gigantic explosions just sprinkled out there?
*  Well, I certainly don't want one to be very nearby and it would have to be within
*  something like 10 light years to be an existential threat.
*  So they can happen in our galaxy?
*  Oh yeah, yeah.
*  So they would be okay?
*  In most cases, we'd be okay because our galaxy is 100,000 light years across
*  and you'd need one of these things to be within about 10 light years to be an existential threat.
*  And it gives birth to a bunch of other stars, I guess?
*  Yeah, it gives birth to expanding gases that are chemically enriched and those expanding gases
*  mixed with other chemically enriched expanding gases or primordial clouds of hydrogen and helium.
*  I mean, this is in a sense the greatest story ever told, right? I teach this introductory
*  astronomy course at Berkeley and I tell them there's only five or six things that I want them to
*  really understand and remember. And I'm going to come to their deathbed and I'm going to ask them
*  about this and if they get it wrong, I will retroactively fail.
*  Their whole career will have been shot.
*  Students' worst nightmare.
*  Observe a total solar eclipse and yet they had the opportunity to do so.
*  I will retroactively fail them. But one of them is, where did we come from? Where did the elements
*  in our DNA come from? The carbon in our cells, the oxygen that we breathe, the calcium in our
*  bones, the iron in our red blood cells, those elements, the phosphorus in our DNA, they all
*  came from stars, from nuclear reactions in stars and they were ejected into the cosmos
*  and in some cases like iron made during the explosions. And those gases drifted out mixed
*  with other clouds, made a new star or a star cluster, some of whose members then evolved and
*  exploded, thus enriching the gases in the galaxy progressively more with time until finally,
*  four and a half billion years ago, from one of these chemically enriched clouds,
*  our solar system formed with a rocky Earth-like planet and somewhere, somehow, these self-replicating
*  evolving molecules, bacteria formed and evolved through paramecia and amoebas and slugs and apes
*  and us. And here we are, sentient beings that can ask these questions about our very origins
*  and with our intellect and with the machines we make, come to a reasonable understanding of
*  our origins. What a beautiful story. I mean, if that does not put you at least in awe, if not in
*  love with science and its power of deduction, I don't know what will. It's one of the greatest
*  stories, if not the greatest story, obviously that's personality dependent and all that,
*  it's a subjective opinion, but it's perhaps the greatest story ever told. I mean, you could link
*  it to the Big Bang and go even farther to make an even more complete story, but as a subset,
*  that's even in some ways a greater story than even the existence of the universe in some ways,
*  because you could just imagine some really boring universe that never leads to sentient creatures
*  such as ourselves. Is the supernova usually the introduction to that story? Yeah. Are they usually
*  the thing that launches the… Is there other engines of creation? Well, the supernova is the
*  one… I mean, I touch upon the subject earlier in my course, in fact, right about now in my lectures
*  because I talk about how our sun right now is fusing hydrogen to form helium nuclei and later
*  it'll form carbon and oxygen nuclei, but that's where the process will stop for our sun. It's not
*  massive enough. Some stars that are more massive can go somewhat beyond that. So that's the beginning
*  of this idea of the birth of the heavy elements since they couldn't have been born at the time of
*  the Big Bang. Conditions of temperature and pressure weren't sufficient to make any significant
*  quantities of the heavier elements. And so that's the beginning, but then you need some of these
*  stars to explode because if those heavy elements remained forever trapped in the cores of stars,
*  then they would not be available for the production of new stars, planets, and ultimately life. So
*  indeed, the supernova, my main area of interest, plays a leading role in this whole story.
*  I saw that you got a chance to call Richard Feynman a mentor of yours when you were at Caltech.
*  Do you have any fond memories of Feynman? Any lessons that stick with you?
*  Oh yeah. He was quite a character and one of the deepest thinkers of all time probably.
*  And at least in my life, the physicist who had the single most intuitive understanding of how nature
*  works of anyone I've met. I learned a number of things from him. He was not my thesis advisor.
*  I worked with Wallace Sargent at Caltech on what are called active galaxies, big black holes in
*  the centers of galaxies that are accreting or swallowing material, a little bit like the stuff
*  of this year's Nobel Prize in Physics 2020. But Feynman I had for two courses. One was
*  general theory of relativity at the graduate level and one was applications of quantum physics
*  to all kinds of interesting things. And he had this very intuitive way of looking at things
*  that he tried to bring to his students. And he felt that if you can't explain something
*  in a reasonably simple way to a non-scientist or at least someone who is versed a little bit
*  with science but is not a professional scientist, then you probably don't understand it very well
*  yourself very thoroughly. So that in me made a desire to be able to explain science to the
*  general public. And I've often found that in explaining things, yeah, there's a certain part
*  that I didn't really understand myself. That's one reason I like to teach the introductory courses
*  to the lay public is that I sometimes find that my explanations are lacking in my own mind.
*  So he did that for me.
*  Is there, if I could just pause for a second, you said he had one of the most intuitive
*  understandings of nature. If you could break apart what intuitive means, is it on a philosophical
*  level? No, sort of physical. How do you draw a mental picture or a picture on paper of what's
*  going on? And he's perhaps most famous in this regard for his Feynman diagrams, which in what's
*  called quantum electrodynamics, a quantum field theory of electricity and magnetism,
*  what you have are actually an exchange of photons between charged particles and they
*  might even be virtual photons if the particles are at rest relative to one another. And there
*  are ways of doing calculations that are brute force that take pages on pages and pages of
*  calculations. And Julian Schwinger developed some of the mathematics for that and won the Nobel
*  Prize for it. But Feynman had these diagrams that he made and he had a set of rules of what to do at
*  the vertex. You'd have two particles coming together and then a particle going out and then
*  two particles coming out again. And he'd have these rules associated when there were vertices
*  and when there were particles splitting off from one another and all that. And it looked a little
*  bit like a bunch of a hodgepodge at first, but to those who learned the rules and understood them,
*  they saw that you could do these complex calculations in a much simpler way.
*  And indeed, in some ways, Freeman Dyson had an even better knack for explaining really what
*  quantum electrodynamics actually was. But I didn't know Freeman Dyson. I knew Feynman. Maybe he did
*  have a more intuitive view of the world than Feynman did. But of the people I knew, Feynman
*  was the most intuitive, most sort of, is there a picture? Is there a simple way you can understand
*  this? And in the path that a particle follows even, you can figure out the, you can get the
*  classical path, at least for a baseball or something like that, by using quantum physics if you want.
*  But in a sense, the baseball sniffs out all possible paths. It goes out to the Andromeda
*  galaxy and then goes to the batter. But the probability of doing that is very, very small
*  because tiny little paths next door to any given path cancel out that path. And the ones that all
*  add together, they are the ones that are more likely to be followed. And this actually ties in
*  with Fermat's principle of least action. And there are ideas in optics that go into this as well.
*  And it just sort of beautifully brings everything together. But the particle sniffs out all possible
*  paths. What a crazy idea. But if you do the mathematics associated with that,
*  it ends up being actually useful, a useful way of looking at the world.
*  RG So you're also, I mean, you're widely acknowledged as, I mean, outside of your science work as being
*  one of the greatest educators in the world. And Feynman is famous for being that. Is there something
*  about being a teacher that you-
*  AC Well, it's very, very rewarding when you have students who are really into it. And
*  going back to Feynman, at Caltech, I was taking these graduate courses. And there were two of us,
*  myself and Jeff Richmond, who's now a professor of physics at University of California, Santa Barbara,
*  who asked lots of questions. And a lot of the Caltech students are nervous about asking
*  questions. They want to save face. They seem to think that if they ask a question, their
*  peers might think it's a stupid question. Well, I didn't really care what people thought,
*  and Jeff Richmond didn't either. And we asked all these questions. And in fact, in many cases,
*  they were quite good questions. And Feynman said, well, the rest of you should be having questions
*  like this. And I remember one time in particular when he said to the rest of the class, why is
*  it always these two? Aren't the rest of you curious about what I'm saying? Do you really
*  understand it all that well? If so, why aren't you asking the next most logical question?
*  No, you guys are too scared to ask these questions that these two are asking.
*  So he actually invited us to lunch a couple of times where just the three of us sat and had lunch
*  with one of the greatest thinkers of 20th century physics. And so yeah, he rubbed off on me. And
*  So you encourage questions as well?
*  I encourage questions. I encourage questions. I like it when students ask questions. I tell them
*  that they shouldn't feel shy about asking a question. Probably half the students in the
*  class would have that same question if they even understood the material enough to ask that question.
*  Curiosity is the first step of seeing the beauty of something. So yeah,
*  and the question is the ultimate form of curiosity. Let me ask, what is the meaning of life?
*  The meaning of life, you know, from a cosmologist perspective or from a human perspective,
*  from my personal, you know, life is what you make of it really, right? It's,
*  each of us has to have our own meaning. And it doesn't have to be. Well, I think that in many
*  cases, meaning is to some degree associated with goals. You set some goals or expectations
*  for yourself, things you want to accomplish, things you want to do, things you want to experience.
*  And to the degree that you experience those and do those things, it can give you meaning.
*  You don't have to change the world the way Newton or Michelangelo or Da Vinci did. I mean,
*  people often say, change the world. But look, come on, there's seven and a half,
*  close to 8 billion of us now. Most of us are not going to change the world. And does that mean that
*  most of us are leading meaningful lives? No, it just has to be something that gives you meaning,
*  that gives you satisfaction, that gives you a good feeling about what you did. And often,
*  based on human nature, which can be very good and also very bad, but often it's the things that help
*  others that give us meaning and a feeling of satisfaction. You taught someone to read,
*  you cared for someone who was terminally ill, you brought up a nice family, you brought up your kids,
*  you did a good job, you put your heart and soul into it.
*  You read a lot of books, if that's what you wanted to do, had a lot of perspectives
*  on life. You traveled the world, if that's what you wanted to do. But if some of these things
*  are not within reach, you're in a socioeconomic position where you can't travel the world or
*  whatever, you find other forms of meaning. It doesn't have to be some profound,
*  I'm going to change the world, I'm going to be the one who everyone remembers type thing, right?
*  In the context of the greatest story ever told, the fact that we came from stars
*  and now we're two apes asking about the meaning of life, how does that fit together?
*  Does that make any sense?
*  You know, it does, it does. And this is sort of what I was referring to, that it's a beautiful
*  universe that allows us to come into creation, right? It's a way that the universe found of
*  knowing, of understanding itself, because I don't think that inanimate rocks and stars and black
*  holes and things have any real capability of abstract thoughts and of learning about
*  the rest of the universe or even their origins. I mean, they're just a pile of atoms that has no
*  conscience, has no ability to think, has no ability to explore. And we do. And I'm not saying we're
*  the epitome of all life forever, but at least for life on earth so far, the evidence suggests that
*  we are the epitome in terms of the richness of our thoughts, the degree to which we can explore
*  the universe, do experiments, build machines, understand our origins. And I just hope that we
*  use science for good, not evil, and that we don't end up destroying ourselves. I mean, the whales
*  and dolphins are plenty intelligent. They don't ask abstract questions. They don't read books.
*  But on the other hand, they're not in any danger of destroying themselves and everything else
*  as well. And so maybe that's a better form of intelligence. But at least in terms of our
*  ability to explore and make use of our minds, I mean, to me, it's this that gives me the potential
*  for meaning, right? The fact that I can understand and explore. It's kind of fascinating to think
*  that the universe created us and eventually we've built telescopes to look back at it,
*  to look back at its origins and to wonder how the heck the thing works.
*  It's magnificent. It needn't have been that way. Right? And this is one of the multiverse sort of
*  things. You can alter the laws of physics or even the constants of nature, seemingly
*  inconsequential things like the mass ratio of the proton and the neutron.
*  Wake me up when it's over, right? What could be more boring? But it turns out you play with things
*  a little bit like the ratio of the mass of the neutron to the proton. And you generally get
*  boring universes, only hydrogen or only helium or only iron. You don't even get the rich periodic
*  table, let alone bacteria, paramecia slugs and humans. Okay? I'm not even anthropocentrizing
*  to the degree that I could. Even a rich periodic table wouldn't be possible if certain constants
*  weren't this way, but they are. And that to me leads to the idea of a multiverse that the
*  dice were thrown many, many times. And there's this cosmic archipelago where most of the universes are
*  boring and some might be more interesting, but we are in the rare breed that's really quite darn
*  interesting. And if there were only one and maybe there is only one,
*  well then that's truly amazing. We're lucky. We're lucky, but I actually think there are lots in
*  the lost. Just like there are lots of planets, Earth isn't special for any particular reason.
*  There are lots of planets in our solar system and especially around other stars. And occasionally,
*  there are going to be ones that are conducive to the development of complexity, culminating in life
*  as we know it. And that's a beautiful story. I don't think there's a better way to end it.
