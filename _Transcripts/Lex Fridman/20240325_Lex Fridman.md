# Dana White: UFC, Fighting, Khabib, Conor, Tyson, Ali, Rogan, Elon & Zuck | Lex Fridman Podcast #421
**Lex Fridman:** [March 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7aQEqDbuf8)
*  Habib beat Connor. Putin was on FaceTime before he even made it to the to the locker room. Trump,
*  sitting president, ex-president, watching all the fights, calling once to talk about the fights.
*  Valentina Shevchenko, every time she goes home, she meets with the president of the country.
*  The list goes on and on and on. The most powerful Elon Musk, Zuckerberg, I mean,
*  the list goes on and on and on. The most powerful people in the world are all obsessed with fighting.
*  The following is a conversation with Dana White, the president of the UFC,
*  a mixed martial arts organization that revolutionized the art, the sport,
*  and the business of fighting. And Dana is truly the mastermind behind the UFC.
*  This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now, dear friends, here's Dana White. Do you remember when you saw your first fight?
*  I think so. I remember being at my grandmother's house. I think it was an Ali fight. And all my
*  uncles were going crazy during the fight. And there was just this buzz and this energy in the house that
*  I liked at a very young age. And I'm pretty sure that was my first fight.
*  Ali was something special.
*  Yeah. Incredible. I mean, when you look around, not just here in the office, but at my house,
*  Ali and Tyson are everywhere.
*  Would you put Ali as the greatest of all time boxing?
*  Well, I would put Ali as the greatest all time human being. I mean, when you...
*  It's easy as a fight fan to focus on him as a fighter. But when you focus on him as a human
*  and you think about what he meant at that time and place, the things he said, the poems he came up
*  with, just the overall brilliance of Muhammad Ali, the guts, the guts to have the strength,
*  mentally, physically, and emotionally to go against the grain at the time that he did it.
*  It was a very dangerous time for him to be who he was. Yet, because of how smart he was and because
*  of his personality and how if you sat down with him, you could be the biggest racist on the planet.
*  It's hard to get in a room with Ali and not like Ali.
*  Yeah. He's all love, humor, all of it.
*  100%.
*  And had the guts in the ring and the guts to take a stand.
*  100%.
*  When it was hard.
*  He might be one of the all time greatest humans. You know what I mean? Just an impactful, powerful
*  human being who happened to be a great boxer.
*  And sometimes the right moment meets the great human being. That's important.
*  I agree with you. And he was the right guy in the right place at the right time.
*  And he's also a guy who used his platform for all the right things.
*  So that might've been your first fight, but when did you fall in love with fighting?
*  The art of it, the science of it?
*  Yeah. I would say I really fell in love with it. So I was a senior. It was 1987.
*  And Hagler Leonard happened.
*  Yeah.
*  And I watched that fight and I taped it. And I watched that fight like a million times.
*  I was a huge, huge Hagler fan. And I like Sugar Ray Leonard too, but I was a huge Hagler fan.
*  And I just remember I watched that fight a million times because I was pissed off and I felt like
*  Hagler got robbed in the fight. You know what I mean? But that was really what made me start to
*  love the sport of boxing.
*  The battle of it.
*  Yeah. I was 17. And then after that, USA's Tuesday Night Fights came out on television,
*  every Tuesday night. Religiously never missed Tuesday Night Fights. I was there,
*  watched all those fights. And a lot of the things you see in the UFC, not necessarily
*  just the production, but I would say the feel and the style and all those things are all things that
*  I, things that I loved about boxing and things that I hated about boxing, right down to the commentary.
*  You loved and hated?
*  Hated, yeah.
*  Hated the commentary.
*  Certain things that I loved about boxing, I incorporated into the UFC. Things that I hated
*  that I hated about boxing, I made sure that the UFC stayed far away from. I think I can't
*  stand Larry Merchant. Can't stand Larry Merchant. And I used to watch HBO boxing and mute the
*  commentary so that I didn't have to listen to them. Lampley too. You would spend this money for the
*  pay-per-view to watch these people that you idolized to hear these idiots rip them apart
*  while the fight was happening.
*  Oh, they were criticizing.
*  Yeah, 100%.
*  I've gotten used to the UFC so I'm trying to remember looking back.
*  It was bad.
*  It was bad?
*  It was really bad.
*  But the sweet science, the art of boxing was beautiful still.
*  Like the stories were still-
*  I want to do this with you right now. Hey, we bring your cell phone over here and pull up YouTube.
*  I want to do this for you so that you can understand this and understand where I was
*  coming from.
*  For the commentary.
*  Yeah, at this point in time.
*  I have all good memories. You're going to ruin it for me.
*  Yeah, no, there are nothing but great memories about boxing. But the presentation and a lot of
*  things- but it's how fucking weird is it that I even cared about this shit at that point in my
*  life and that time in my life? Like what impact could I possibly have on it? So think about Tyson
*  and how much everybody loved Tyson at the time and want to listen to this. Listen to this entrance.
*  Of the former undisputed heavyweight champion.
*  And here he comes, Mike Tyson. As he heads toward the same ring, he made his disgraceful exit
*  in June of 96.
*  Wow.
*  One of the baddest motherfucking walk-ins of all time, by the way.
*  Right? So what this guy should be doing- and this is one of the Albert brothers.
*  Yeah.
*  Shut the fuck up.
*  Yeah.
*  Stay out of the way.
*  Yeah. Maybe build them up.
*  Or that. Or don't say anything.
*  Just let the fans- that's why-
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  That's why we paid our money.
*  You don't need to say anything.
*  Scary, imposing music.
*  Will he be able to intimidate his opponent tonight? Will it even matter?
*  I really thought there'd be more of an explosion by the crowd here, but very mixed.
*  Fuck.
*  Even with a win tonight, no matter how one started, he will still have his detractors.
*  Following the two fights to with Holyfield, his stock plummeted. The pundits came down hard,
*  feeling they were due. And his knockouts were over second-rate fighters.
*  Now the crowd erupts more as he gets into the ring.
*  But it's certainly nothing overwhelming.
*  What a dick.
*  You're right. I don't remember that. You're right.
*  Imagine-
*  You're right.
*  You paid your money to watch Mike Tyson, and you got to listen to these fucking jerk-offs
*  talk shit about him the whole way to the-
*  First of all, one of the coolest walk-ins ever. The first time anybody had heard DMX.
*  He's walking into some scary, imposing music. Will it even matter?
*  You know, it's just all that kind of stuff. I literally used to analyze every
*  ounce of the production that would happen on television. And at a time when I didn't even
*  know why I was doing it, but- But it's in there somewhere. You were thinking about it.
*  Right? So yeah, I hated HBO commentary. I thought, you know, at the time,
*  HBO boxing was obviously the gold standard for- But when you really think about boxing
*  at that time, their production, the only thing that changed over 30 years was like HD.
*  I mean, even the commentators were the same for 30 years. And then you had the time when
*  Larry Merchant gets up and literally starts fighting with Floyd Mayweather during the interview
*  and says, if I was 30 years younger, I'd kick your ass right now.
*  Oh yeah. I remember that.
*  I mean, these are the interviews that we have to listen to when we're trying to watch a boxing match.
*  The level of boxing was good.
*  Think about a fighter, right? Fighter has been gone for months away from their families and
*  away from everything. Training, cutting weight, sparring. Then they go in and they have to fight
*  that night. And then you have to, you know, if you watch your fight back, you got to listen to this
*  bullshit from these guys. And then, and then you get interviewed and your interview is, is this.
*  And it's not just about the pay-per-view money. It's about like, these are legends of humanity.
*  100%.
*  We should celebrate the highest form of like accomplishment. These aren't like Mike Tyson.
*  So you know who goes in there and interviews fighters? Joe Rogan, right? Who is trained and
*  done everything and has the utmost respect for the sport and the athletes. Or you got like Daniel
*  Cormier, who was a former world champion himself and has actually been through it, done it, knows.
*  And those are the type of people that we put in the booth, people that are actually experienced in
*  it. Not, not, not, not these people who've never been in a fight in their fucking life.
*  Right. Yeah. But they're also both DC and Rogan are like big kids. They love it.
*  100%.
*  They really love it.
*  Well, everybody does. I mean, if you look at it, it's the difference between our commentary and
*  what I feel their commentary was. We don't hire paid talking heads. We hire people that have
*  actually been in it, done it, love it, and are super passionate about the sport.
*  And I would say that none of them that ever covered the sport back then were, I don't know
*  if that was Marv Albert or what Albert brother that was, but he sound like he's a fan of the sport or
*  anyway, you got me on this and I lose my mind.
*  Maybe we wouldn't have a UFC if they didn't fuck it up so bad for the Tyson.
*  It would be different. You're not wrong. You're not wrong. It would be different. There's no
*  doubt about it. All those experiences growing up being a boxing fan helped create what the UFC is
*  today.
*  You know, it's interesting because humans have been fighting for millennia and it seems like
*  with the UFC, the rate of innovation is just insane. In these last three decades, it seems
*  like we've discovered how to do unarmed combat faster and better than any time in human history.
*  I agree with you 100%. The first UFC happened in 1993, right? Martial art versus martial art.
*  Yeah.
*  And now over the last 30 years, martial arts has evolved faster than, you know what I mean?
*  Like you just said, combat sports, fighting, whatever you want to call it, martial arts,
*  it has evolved so much in 30 years, more than the last 300 years.
*  What did you think when you saw UFC One with Hoice?
*  I remember everybody talking that this fight was going to happen and there was going to be no rules
*  and all this other stuff. And we're like, there's no way that's bullshit. And then we ended up at
*  some guy's house that night in Boston and watching it and it was happening and it was fun and it was
*  exciting and everything else. And then I sort of fell off after that. The first one I watched,
*  but I was too big of a boxing fan. Plus once grappling started taking over and, you know,
*  by grappling meaning the wrestling and the jujitsu guys had just laid there,
*  I completely lost interest. It's funny that I'm having this conversation with you right now,
*  because last night I was out last night with my friends and we were talking about,
*  because one of my buddies who's a host here in town just did jujitsu for the first time yesterday.
*  Yeah.
*  And he was like-
*  Did he get his ass kicked?
*  Yeah, yeah. But when you first go in, our first jujitsu lesson, me, Lorenzo, and Frank was with
*  John Lewis. And I remember thinking, holy shit, I can't believe that I'm, you know, 28 years old.
*  And this is the first time I'm experiencing this, that another human being could do this to me
*  on the ground. It is such an eye opening, mind blowing experience when you do it for the first
*  time. And then you become completely addicted to it. And, you know, we were training three,
*  four days a week, trying to kill each other and me and the frititas. And that's how we fell in
*  love with the sport. I think that first time that you do jujitsu, it's like the red pill and the blue
*  pill in the matrix. Do you want to believe that this is the world that you live in or do you want
*  to see what the real world looks like? Jiu-jitsu is a real red pill.
*  It really is.
*  You realize, holy shit, all that shit talking I've been doing about me being a badass,
*  you realize you're not. You get dominated by another human being, you realize, no.
*  And I mean, dominate. I mean, completely treat you like you're a little kid.
*  And then we had the opportunity to roll with a lot of different guys at the time because of the
*  whatever. And we don't have a good relationship at all. But I'll tell you this, Frank Shamrock
*  came in one day and Frank Shamrock had me in side control. The pressure that this guy put on my chest
*  made me tap. Felt like there was a car on my chest and with zero effort from him. It was
*  absolutely effortless. And when you train with somebody that's at such a level when you're not,
*  it just it is the most humbling, mind blowing experience you can have, especially as a man,
*  but as a human being. Do you remember, just for fun, do you remember like what your go to submission
*  was? Yeah. So, you know, when we first started out and started doing it, I had a pretty good
*  guillotine in the beginning. So I'd catch a lot of people in guillotines. And you're okay being
*  like on bottom. So like, yeah, I was okay with the bottom. Yeah, I was okay with being on bottom. I
*  was comfortable there. But you know what I never liked? I never liked gi. Like we started fucking
*  around with a gi in the beginning. We would, you know, that's how we started. And then once I took
*  the gi off, I felt like I had no submissions because I couldn't grab onto anything. So I,
*  after that, I went all no gi and I never wanted to wear a gi. And it's fascinating because no
*  gi has become big now. And there's a lot of interesting people. I got trained on Gordon
*  Ryan and like the level there is just fascinating. It's become like the science
*  and it looks like fighting now. It looks more like fighting as opposed to with the
*  gi. Sometimes it doesn't quite look like fighting. Right. And I feel like it's
*  transferable to actual like MMA fighting, no gi stuff. Or street. Street. Yeah. Right. I mean,
*  if you start off in your first year, you're in a gi. I mean, you better hope guys got like
*  winter jackets on or something that something happens in the street. Cause it, in my opinion,
*  I know all the jujitsu fucking people are gonna go crazy over this, but in my opinion,
*  no gi is way better than gig. That's it. I also do judo. So in the street scenario,
*  if you're comfortable on the feet and you can clinch and you can throw, you could,
*  because most of us wear clothing, especially in Boston and New York City. So if you're comfortable
*  on the feet, you could still do well there. The problem with jujitsu is most people are not
*  comfortable on the feet. The sports jujitsu. Most people kind of want to get to the ground as
*  quickly as possible. So what'd you think of hoists at that time? Like in the early, like what,
*  cause it blew a lot of people's minds that there's like more to this puzzle. 100%. And the fact that
*  you had like these guys like Ken Shamrock that were jacked, right. And you had all these wrestlers or,
*  you know, the big massive guys that they had in the different weight classes and this skinny
*  little dude like hoists was out there beating everybody. I mean, if you look at the way the
*  Gracie's played that you couldn't have had a better advertisement for, for Gracie jujitsu at the time.
*  But also like for MMA, because there's just like a lot of surprising elements. A lot of people's
*  prediction was wrong. They didn't think the skinny guy would win. And they're like, oh shit,
*  there's more to this. What's the real beautiful thing about jujitsu. It's like when you talk about,
*  if you wanted to get your daughter into a martial art, should I put my daughter into karate? Or
*  should I put her into this? You put your daughter into jujitsu 100% because it's not about size or
*  strength. It's about technique. And you give your daughter a bunch of jujitsu and a little bit of
*  Muay Thai. You know, it's like the perfect combo. Cause you can put your son into anything. Your son
*  can get into some, you know, boys are going to learn how to fight and they're going to do whatever,
*  but girls are, girls are different. And the other thing, I mean, this is the biggest selling point
*  for jujitsu for women. I mean, when a woman, no matter how big, how small can put a guy to sleep
*  in three and a half seconds. What's the origin story of the UFC as it is today, as you've created
*  it and you and Lorenzo and Fertino brothers built it. It started with, with John Lewis, you know,
*  and, and seeing him, Frank and I were out one night at the hard rock and John Lewis was there
*  and he's like, Oh, that's that ultimate fighting guy. And I was like, I know him and Frank's like,
*  I've always wanted to learn, uh, ground fighting. And I said, yeah, I'm interested in it too. So we
*  went over, we talked to John Lewis and we made an appointment to wrestle with him on Monday.
*  Yeah. And we told Lorenzo and Lorenzo came with us. And, uh, that was the beginning of the end.
*  I mean, we started doing jujitsu and started to meet a lot of the fighters and we were like,
*  you know, at the time there was a stigma attached to the sport that these guys were, you know,
*  despicable, disgusting human beings, but which was the furthest thing from the truth. These,
*  these kids, uh, had all gone to college, had college degrees, most of them, cause they wrestled in
*  college and we started to meet some of them. We loved the different stories. You had Chuck Liddell
*  who, you know, had this Mohawk looks like an ax murder and, uh, but graduated from Cal Poly,
*  uh, you know, w with honors and accounting, you know, then you had Matt Hughes, who was this farm
*  boy, you know, literally lived on a farm. And so there were all these cool stories with all these
*  good people that weren't what people thought they were. And Lorenzo and I always felt like
*  there's something here that if this thing was done the right way, this could be big.
*  And what was crazy was I, uh, I was in a contract negotiation with Bob Meyerwitz,
*  the old owner of the UFC over Tito's contract, um, and Chuck Liddell, they didn't even want
*  Chuck Liddell in the UFC. I was trying to get Chuck in the UFC and they didn't even want him.
*  And we got into this contract dispute over Tito's contract and Bob Meyerwitz said, you know what,
*  there is no more money. Okay. I don't even know if I'll even be able to put on one more event
*  and he like flipped out. When we hung up the phone, I literally picked up the phone and called Lorenzo
*  and I said, Hey, I just got off the phone with Bob Meyerwitz, the owner of the UFC. I think they're
*  in trouble and I think we could buy it. And I think we should, you should reach out to him.
*  So Lorenzo, uh, Lorenzo called Meyerwitz and I don't know how, I don't remember the timeline,
*  but within the next two months we ended up owning the UFC for 2 million bucks.
*  And, uh, you've said that you fought a lot of battles during that time.
*  No, I mean the early days of building this company and building the sport, it was the
*  wild, wild west man. It was, it was crazy back then. Um, yeah, I was literally at war every day
*  with all different types of people. Plus traditionally there's bad people that are
*  involved in, in fighting, man, lots of bad people. And we had to sift our way through that for the
*  first seven, eight years. So in general, there's like corruption and the people kind of steal money.
*  They're thinking just about themselves, not the bigger business.
*  Let me tell you about this. I mean, I want to say it was the Netherlands. I don't remember exactly
*  where it could have been Amsterdam. I mean, MMA promoters were like car bombing each other and
*  then the other guy shot up the other guy's house with machine guns and that's the kind of shit
*  that was going on. I'll tell you the story. So affliction, do you remember affliction?
*  Yeah.
*  So there was a guy, I want to say, I want to, I want to say the name was Tom Todd beard or
*  something like that. This guy used to text me every day when they were, when they started their MMA
*  thing, telling me he was going to kill me. Like legitimately legitimately going to kill me.
*  Yeah. You punk motherfucker. I'm going to fucking kill you. You don't understand who I am and what
*  I've done and this and that. I think this guy would get drunk or do drugs every night or whatever his
*  deal was. This guy would call me, text me and threaten my life every day. I used to go, fuck you.
*  And you said fuck you. Oh yeah. Especially back then. Yeah. But yeah, but I mean,
*  this is the type of shit that went on in the early days. This guy, this guy who was one of the owners
*  of affliction was like one of the, you know, not a good human. Let's put it that way. What about the
*  business side of it? It's tough to make money in this business. Yeah. We weren't making money. So,
*  you know, trying to build this thing, corrupt,
*  corrupt, the guys that work for in demand pay per view at the time,
*  were not good dudes, you know, and that thing was a fucking total monopoly. God,
*  I wish I could remember his name right now. He used to run in demand and he was a fucking bad guy.
*  Then he, then he comes over and starts running direct TV who we always had a great relationship
*  with. And he's the reason we left direct TV and said, fuck it. We'll just go streaming then.
*  Yeah. I don't remember his name. I'd have to ask Lorenzo. So in general, just in this whole space,
*  there's a lot of shady people. Yeah. It's just everybody you deal with is dealing with a lot of,
*  a lot of, a lot of different forces and your, your hands are in a lot of different businesses.
*  You know, from the venue business to the merchandise business, to the video game business,
*  the pay per view business, you know, the list goes on and on of all the different types of
*  the production business of all these different, you know, when I first started this,
*  I, we had a production team that was the production team that was in it before we bought it.
*  So there was this, there was this incident with Phil Barone where Phil Barone,
*  we did an interview with him and Barone flips out in the interview when they're interviewing him
*  and goes crazy. And I thought it was awesome. So I'm like, we're going to leave this in,
*  we're going to leave this interview in. And the production guys were arguing with me.
*  They're like, we can't leave this in. This is totally unprofessional. And I said, I don't give
*  a shit. This is, this is what we're doing. We're going to, we're going to do this and clip it like
*  this and do it like that. We're sitting in the venue that night and I lean over to Lorenzo
*  because the fights coming up. I go, wait, do you see this fucking interview with Barone?
*  They didn't fucking do it. They didn't do it. These guys were guys that were freelance guys
*  that worked for Showtime at the time or one of the, something like that. I literally went,
*  got up from my fucking seat, went back there, kicked the fucking door in the truck open.
*  And I said, you motherfuckers, you ever do that again and I'll fire every fucking one of you.
*  Let's just put it this way. I ended up firing every one of them anyway and going with a whole
*  new crew. But these were the type of things that early on, you know, there's so much stuff. I mean,
*  I could sit here for fucking three days and walk you through all the stuff that used to go on back
*  in those days. But it was the wild, wild west, man. But how'd you figure out, how'd you know how to
*  deal with all this mess? First of all, to fire people, to fire people that aren't doing a good
*  job, all of that, like how to be a leader, how to be a business leader. Well, that's the thing too.
*  I mean, getting in the early days, there was two employees, me and another girl that worked for me
*  from my company before I started doing this. And then we slowly started to bring people on and you
*  start to build a team. And then before, you know what, we had 10 people. I mean, we used to do our
*  Christmas parties back then too. There'd be eight to 10 people at our Christmas party, you know?
*  But a lot of it is, you learn as you go, you know? You know what me and the Fertitas knew about
*  production when we bought this UFC, we had like, I want to say we had two or three weeks to pull
*  off of an event. This is what we knew about production. Jack shit. So we had to dive in and
*  we had to learn it. We had to figure it out and we knew what we wanted. We knew what we liked. We knew
*  what we were looking for. It's just about building a good team. And I think that's one of the things,
*  if you want to talk about what I've accomplished in the last 25 years of my life, I've been really
*  good at building teams. Already have a vision of what you want the final thing to look like and
*  then build a team that can bring that to life. 100%. Well, you have to have the vision. Without
*  the vision, there's nothing. So that's sort of what I do. I am the vision part of this thing.
*  We're going to open a PI in Mexico. We're going to do this. We're going to do that, you know?
*  And then you build the team to come in and help execute.
*  A lot of people that do fighting promotions fail. You succeeded against long odds. What's the secret
*  to your success? If you were just looking back over the years? Well, the secret to success, I would say,
*  first of all, is passion and consistency. You have to love what you do. You have to get up every day.
*  And I get here every day at 930 in the morning. When we sold in 2016, a lot of people in the
*  company made a lot of money and they all took off and they retired. Other than the frititas,
*  I made the most money. I'm still here. I get here at 930 every morning. Last night, I left here at
*  830. And I don't know how late I'm going to be here tonight, but I love what I do. We get up every
*  day and grind. I work just as hard now as I did back then. The difference between back then and
*  now is I don't have to do a bunch of the shit that I don't really like to do. Like budget meetings.
*  I don't like budget meetings. I sat through enough fucking budget meetings. Horrible budget meetings.
*  Horrible. We're losing millions of dollars a year and I'm in these budget meetings.
*  So I get to pick and choose what I do these days. Back in the early days, you don't get to pick and
*  choose. You have to be involved in everything. So costs, you're just looking at costs. You
*  literally go through line by line every fucking number in the company and where did the money go
*  and how can we save costs? How can we do this better? They are brutal and they're multiple
*  times a week. Probably helps to deeply appreciate how much the shit costs though. 100%. Well,
*  you have to know that. In the early days, when you start your business, you have these people
*  who when I hear them say, you know what, I want to work for myself. I want to create my own schedule
*  and I want to do all that. If that's your thought process going into it, you're never going to be
*  successful. You have to pay attention to every single detail of the business early on. You're
*  involved in everything. There's no days off. There's no birthdays. There's no fucking Christmas.
*  There's none of that shit. I literally moved the birth of my second son for a chocolate elf fight.
*  We had a chocolate elf fight coming up and they're like, yeah, your son's going to be born on this
*  date. And I'm like, yeah, that's not going to work. We're going to have to take them earlier.
*  So they literally gave my wife a c-section and took my son early. You're all in. All in. Yeah.
*  And the fascinating thing, like you said, you've said that you could care less about money.
*  You're doing this for the love of it. Yeah. I was doing this when I was broke.
*  Yeah. And I'm doing this now when I'm not broke. I'm doing this because I love it. And I
*  feel like there's so much more to do. And this is truly my passion in life. It's like this fear.
*  We're doing this fear. Why? Why would I do this fear? It's going to cost me a bunch of money.
*  It's really challenging. Most people think it can't be pulled off. And you're looking at weird
*  angles, different things going on inside other than the fight and all this other stuff. But
*  yeah, I'm doing it because it's awesome and it's challenging and it's hard. And I think that if
*  anybody can do it right, it's us. So why not take that challenge?
*  It's actually why I'm here. I'm going to this fear for the first time because I'm hanging out
*  with Darren Aronofsky who put together the thing that's in there now. And I can't believe you're
*  thinking of, I don't know how you're going to solve that puzzle. There's many puzzles to solve
*  for this one. Okay. Many puzzles. So how can you speak to that? Like what are interesting
*  challenges that you're encountering? Yeah. So there's a lot. So you have the
*  octagon, right? And then behind it is the world's biggest screen ever, right? So what is the theme?
*  How do you program it? First of all, it's super expensive to shoot and the format for the sphere.
*  Angles, we were talking about today. I just had a big meeting today about the sphere this afternoon
*  and making sure that all my departments, all the details that I want, all start to come together
*  here in the next two weeks. I want the creative, the commercial. I have some goals. I will tell
*  people as we get closer what I'm looking to achieve with this other than putting on one of the greatest,
*  most unique sporting events of all time and probably the greatest combat sporting event of all time.
*  But yeah, there's, I mean, there's challenges. There's a laundry list of challenges for this
*  thing. And not to mention the fact that it's on Mexican Independence Day and we're going to weave
*  in the whole history of combat in Mexico. Yeah. But the production, I mean, this is hilarious
*  because you were just talking about knowing nothing about production so many years ago.
*  And now we're tackling the sphere. The hardest production ever. And that will be live?
*  It'll be live. It'll be live on pay-per-view. It'll be live in the arena and it will also be
*  in movie theaters. Nice. So there'll be a, it'll be shown, we'll be shown at the sphere later too?
*  Like will you try to create an experience? ESPM is doing a doc on it. Nice. The making
*  of the sphere. Yeah. Are you feeling good about it? Oh yeah. I feel incredible about it. I can't wait.
*  It's going to be, it's going to be fun. I can't wait to see how you solve the puzzle. Thank you.
*  Another guy that I feel like could care less about the money is Joe Rogan. How important is he
*  to the UFC, to the rise of the UFC and what in general do you love about Joe?
*  It's a fact. He doesn't care about money and he did the first 13 shows for free for us.
*  Yeah. You know what I mean? That was at a time when we were hurting and he's like, wait a minute,
*  you want me to do the commentary? You're saying that I get to sit in the best seat in the house
*  and watch these fights for free? Yeah. Yeah, I'm in. Yeah. So, and then obviously when we turn
*  things around, we made it up to Joe, but Joe is one of the things that I loved early on about,
*  so I'll tell you the story. So we buy the UFC. They're based in New York. We're moving the
*  corporate offices to Vegas. So I have to fly out to New York, go into the offices and
*  and start going through everything and figuring out what needs to come back to Vegas and what we
*  can just throw away. So they literally had a VHS machine and a TV and there were a million tapes
*  in this place, man. So I didn't know what tapes were that these definitely we have to keep or
*  these we don't need. So I had to sit there and go through every single tape and I popped in a tape
*  and there was an interview on the ivory Keenan Wayans show, right? The oldest Wayans brother and
*  he had a talk show at the time and he had Joe Rogan, the guy from Fear Factor on the show.
*  And he was promoting Fear Factor, but all he would talk about was UFC. And he was talking about
*  how people think that these guys in the martial arts movies are tough and he was talking about
*  what UFC fighters would do to these martial arts guys if they ever got their hands on them.
*  And I was like, this is exactly what I need. A guy who isn't afraid to speak his mind
*  and knows the sport inside and out, but more importantly is super passionate about it and
*  loves it. So when you see Joe Rogan on camera and I was talking about the paid dock talking heads
*  that they had in HBO boxing that were terrible, Joe Rogan does not come off as a paid talking
*  head. He comes off as a guy who loves this. And so early on, no media would cover us.
*  So I had to buy my way onto radio. So we do these radio tours, right? And they would drop us in,
*  you'd have to get up at 3.30 in the morning in Vegas on the West Coast. And they, because
*  they're at 6.30 in the morning in New York and Boston and Florida and all these other places.
*  So they drop you into these markets to do radio, right? And the fighters were horrible at it.
*  Fighters getting up at 3.30 in the morning, especially leading up to a fight, never good.
*  They sound like they're tired, they act like they're tired and they definitely act like they
*  don't want to be on there. And it's bad radio. What you can't have is bad radio. So the only
*  two people that could pull off these radio tours were me and Joe Rogan.
*  So me and Joe Rogan would alternate doing these radio tours all over the country.
*  Just talking about fighting, talking about what this whole thing is, like getting people excited.
*  Two guys that are really into it and passionate about it and love it. And it's one of the things
*  about Rogan too, when early on, nobody understood the ground game. Joe Rogan would walk you through
*  what was happening, literally before it would happen. He would tell you the setup, what was
*  going to come next and everything. He just absolutely articulated it perfectly, brilliantly,
*  and people at home started to understand. And the impact that Joe Rogan has had and continues to
*  have on this sport is immeasurable. He's the biggest podcaster in the world. And he is on the UFC
*  pay-per-views 14 times a year. And he's always talking about the sport. It's immeasurable
*  what this guy has done for this company and the sport.
*  RG Yeah, still to this day. I'll have dinner with him offline. He'll just talk fighting.
*  JL Yeah.
*  RG He just loves it.
*  JL It's true.
*  RG He loves every aspect of it.
*  JL Yeah. Joe Rogan is one of those guys. I saw that early on when,
*  when, why would you go after the fear factor guy, you know, to be such a key component to not only
*  the company, but to the sport. I saw it in the fucking interview on Ivory King and Wayans.
*  RG I value loyalty a lot. And I remember there was a moment, not too long ago, maybe a year ago,
*  when I was sitting with Joe and he had a phone call with you. Joe was getting canceled for
*  something. And they didn't want him commentating the fights. And you on the phone offered your
*  resignation over this. I got teary-eyed over that. That's such a, you're a good man, you know?
*  JL Thank you.
*  RG That was powerful.
*  JL Anybody who is with me, has been with me, knows. When you're with me, you're with me.
*  It's a two-way street. It's not a one-way street. I'm not one of these guys that is going to roll
*  over. It's like going through COVID. I wasn't laying any of these people. Some of these people
*  have been with me for 20 years. We're going to lay them off? This motherfucker will burn, burn
*  before I would do that to my people. It's just, it's just never, none of that type of stuff
*  is ever going to happen while I'm here. I can't say what's going to happen when I leave, but when
*  I'm here, the people who are with me and have been with me, they know exactly what's up. And
*  Joe knows what's up. And again, it's a two-way street. Joe Rogan has been very loyal to me,
*  and I am very loyal to Joe Rogan.
*  RG Lorenzo, another guy you've close friendship with,
*  you seem to have been extremely effective together as business partners. What's the
*  magic behind that? How can you explain that?
*  Yeah, I love them. Lorenzo and I work really well together because we have two different
*  personalities. I'm the guy that always, I'm going here. Lorenzo was always here. You could walk in
*  a room and say, Lorenzo, you just lost $10 million. Lorenzo, you just won $10 million. It never
*  changes. And I'm a guy that goes like this. So we almost balance each other out. There's a lot of
*  things that he's really fucking good at, and there's a lot of things that I'm really fucking
*  good at. And they're both on the opposite sides of the spectrum.
*  So that level-headed thing was useful when the UFC was losing money and it was unknown whether
*  it's going to survive those low points.
*  100%. What's incredible when you think of the story of the UFC, at the time, the casino business was
*  cranking, right? And station casinos was killing it. And stations, their money from stations is
*  what was funding the UFC. Then in the 089 crash, the UFC was killing it in 08 and 09. And the casino
*  businesses were hurting. So timing on everything, the way that it all worked out, couldn't have
*  worked out better for them. And obviously for all of us. When you think about the UFC
*  and how big it is and how far it reaches and how many people it touches, the Frititas brothers
*  made a $2 million investment, then put in like another $44 million. And look at how many lives
*  that investment has changed over the last 25 years.
*  It's fascinating.
*  And it's also crazy, just forget the business of it, just the effect it has on
*  the history of humanity in terms of this is what we do, or descendants of apes that fight.
*  And this is like the organizations that catalyze the innovation in how we fight.
*  Right.
*  It's crazy. It created a whole new sport.
*  That people all over the world participate in now. Literally, there isn't a place on earth
*  that we can't get a fighter from now.
*  You said in the UFC 299 post-fight press conference that sometimes fighters might
*  complain that they get matched up on even odds, but that's actually when legends are made.
*  I think you gave Dustin Poirier as an example. Can you elaborate on that a little bit?
*  What makes a legend? What makes greatness in a fight?
*  Behind the scenes, fighters are a very paranoid bunch of people. They're very paranoid.
*  And there's been this theme with fighters where they're trying to get me beat.
*  We don't determine who wins and loses. If we did, we'd be the WWE.
*  You do. I'm the bells and whistles guy. I make sure that as many people
*  that we can possibly let know that you're fighting on Saturday, know that you're fighting on Saturday.
*  Who you are, who you're going against, and why people should give a shit. That's what I do.
*  Then the night you show up, I put on the best live event that I possibly can,
*  and I put on the best television show that I possibly can. Once that door shuts, it's all up
*  to you. You determine whether you lose or not. If you get into a position where you become
*  so paranoid that you think that the powers that be here are against you, and you try to
*  steer yourself away from certain fights,
*  and that's one of the big things that happens in these other organizations.
*  In these other organizations, the inmates run the asylum.
*  If they don't want to fight bad enough, these other companies don't push, and they don't do this,
*  and they don't do that. We put on the best possible matchups that we can make.
*  In this business, you might be an older fighter, but if you're still ranked in the top 10,
*  there's young guys coming for you. Killers. Young killers are coming out, and they want your
*  position. You, being the veteran that you are, have to prepare yourself to go in.
*  Everybody was saying when we made that fight with Saint Denis that Poirier was in big trouble.
*  That's awesome. That helps build the entire thing. Then Poirier goes out and does what he did that
*  night. That's what makes fucking legends. It's interesting because sometimes being the underdog
*  is a really good thing for the long-term story of who you are as a fighter. Especially when you're
*  a big name, and a name that people recognize, and a name that people know. I remember Israel
*  Adesanya and Shawn Strickland. 100 out of 100 people knew for a fact that Israel was going to
*  win that fight. Here comes Strickland. We could go on for days with this. That is what creates
*  legendary moments, legendary fights, and it's what builds stars and legends.
*  Arguably, Conor McGregor with Jose Aldo.
*  Yep. Conor McGregor with a bunch of people in the beginning. People said he couldn't wrestle.
*  People said he wouldn't be able to defend a takedown. Nate Diaz against Conor McGregor.
*  You know what I mean?
*  And Conor McGregor against Habib. Underdog probably, but if you won, there's an opportunity
*  to win. If you won, that's the legend for me. He's now in the conversation for the greatest of all
*  time without argument.
*  And if you look at the way that Habib ran through so many people, Conor hung in there,
*  you know, and made a fight of it.
*  It could have been. What do you think about that matchup? It's one of the greats,
*  one of the great matchups that you've made. Conor McGregor versus Habib.
*  Yeah. I mean, at the time, I was incredibly criticized for putting together the spot
*  that had the scene with the bus in it.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  You know, the fucking media is, but they were saying that I was pandering to the,
*  you know, to the violence that happened and trying to, I'm telling you a story.
*  Telling you a story of how we got here and how big this fight is
*  and how bad the blood is between these guys.
*  And I mean, I think that's what we do.
*  The best job at is telling the fucking stories of why
*  we go into Monday. It's fight week.
*  We got a whole list of things that we do fight week. Right.
*  And then you get right down to the press conference on Thursday,
*  the weigh-ins on Friday, and then the fights on Saturday.
*  Now, my people fly back home to go to bed on Sunday night.
*  And it's groundhog day. We wake up again on Monday and it starts all over again,
*  every weekend, every Saturday for a year.
*  So there's lots of stories that need to be told. There's lots of,
*  when you think about what I compete with, whatever takes your attention on a Saturday night,
*  is my competitor.
*  So you're always trying to build a foundation for great stories.
*  And like, if the fighters step up, they step up and they can together create greatness.
*  That's it. That's exactly right. So when we are online, like when you get to the UFC,
*  I mean, you just saw it with MVP. You're going to see it with Kayla Harrison and so many others
*  that have come from other organizations and they get here. They notice immediately the
*  difference between fighting here and fighting wherever they were before.
*  It's not even comparable to the impact it has on you when you leave whatever organization
*  you're with and you come to the UFC. And I think that it gives them a sense of,
*  holy shit, I can really, I mean, MVP when he came, I mean, there were probably more
*  people at the press conference than any fight he'd ever fought in Bellator.
*  You know what I mean? And you feel that energy and you feel the difference of the impact
*  of being here. And I think it takes a lot of these guys to another level.
*  Yeah. Just the aura of it. Like this is where you're supposed to step up.
*  Yeah. It's the way people feel about Ted talks when they're giving lectures.
*  This is your moment. You get 15 minutes and you better say some interesting shit.
*  And Kayla Harrison, by the way, is a badass. I can't wait to see what happens.
*  She was walking around like this sleeveless shirt the night of the fights and holy shit.
*  She is jacked, man. It's crazy. Two-time Olympic gold medalist.
*  Right. You don't fuck with those people. You want a medal, you're made of something special.
*  So true. Especially in judo. Yeah. Especially in American judo where it's not,
*  you don't have many training partners that are great. So you better fucking work for it.
*  Ridiculous question, but who is in the conversation for the greatest of all time?
*  John Jones. You've talked about John Jones,
*  but what are the metrics involved here? He's never been beat. He destroyed everybody
*  at light heavyweight, which at the time was the toughest weight class in the company,
*  in the sport. And then I moved up to heavyweight, won easily at heavyweight. And
*  when you look at a guy and you look at what he was doing outside the octagon at the same time,
*  which shouldn't be part of it, shouldn't be part of the equation. But when you do, wow.
*  John Jones, there's no debate. Nobody can debate who's the greatest of all time.
*  It's absolutely positively John Jones. He's never lost. He's never been beaten the octagon ever.
*  So that's one of the metrics, like pure sheer dominance. But there's others, right?
*  You could losing sometimes is a catalyst for greatness.
*  I don't disagree. But when you've never lost,
*  you've never lost. We've never found somebody. And the other thing is that you have to factor
*  into is longevity. How long he's, because sometimes with a lot of these guys, the sport
*  passes them by. You get younger guys that are faster, this, that, and the sport evolves.
*  Nobody's been able to beat John Jones. Oh, and the other thing that you measure
*  is, you know, when you said dominance, it's true. If you're this guy that has unbelievable power,
*  and you're just going in, you're just fucking knocking everybody out. And nobody's ever pulled
*  you into the deep water before. That was when my opinion of John Jones started to change.
*  Gustafson took him into the deep water. Gustafson hit him with some shit he'd never been hit with.
*  Gustafson tested him and put John Jones in a place where I bet if you sat down and interviewed John
*  Jones, going into the deep rounds of that, John Jones thought he was going to die. You know what
*  I'm saying? And he's willing to go there. And he kept going. He was willing, willing to do
*  whatever it took to win that fight. And it breaks my heart because he beat DC. And DC is one of the
*  greatest of all time. That's the thing too. And I believe that DC doesn't get the credit he deserves
*  because of the John Jones thing. When you look at DC and what he's accomplished, right?
*  And John Jones beat him twice. It's undeniable. You can hate all you want. John Jones was the
*  greatest of all time. Do you think Habib was tested enough? I think that Habib had the potential
*  to be in the running for that. He just didn't stick around a lot. First of all, he had injuries
*  that he should have been where he got a lot sooner had he not had the injuries that he had
*  and the setbacks in his career. But there's no doubt Habib is one of the all time greats.
*  What's the good, the bad and ugly of your relationship with Connor?
*  There's literally no ugly. Connor McGregor has been an incredible partner to work with.
*  Everybody thinks that Connor, if Connor showed up to things on time, there wouldn't be one fucking
*  bad thing I could say about Connor. You know what I mean? If you fucking said,
*  put a gun to my fucking head, right? And said, don't lie motherfucker. Tell me all the bad
*  things about Connor McGregor. I'd say the guy doesn't show up on time. That's it. If Connor
*  McGregor showed up to shit on time, and sometimes he does, sometimes he does, he'd be, he's been a
*  great partner. If you look at what a huge superstar he became, the fights that he was involved in,
*  let me tell you what Connor McGregor never did. We never walked in a room and said,
*  Connor, this guy just fell out. We want you to fight this guy. And he was like, no way. I'm not
*  taking this fucking risk. I'm at this point in my career where my money, my this, my that, he was
*  like, fuck it. Let's do it. You know, he'd always say, let's do it. The other thing that Connor
*  McGregor never did, no matter how big he was or whatever it was, and we were heading into a fight,
*  oh, Connor, this guy just fell out. Aldo fell out. We were looking for another. Yeah, I'll do it,
*  but I'm going to need another fucking 200,000. I'm going to need another million dollars. I'm going
*  to, Connor McGregor never did that kind of chicken shit, you know, bullshit kind of stuff. He never
*  did any of that. Connor was as solid a guy as you could possibly work with. Just fuck it. I'll do it.
*  I'll do it. Literally would, there's actually a scene because we were filming something. I don't
*  know if it was embedded or what we were filming at the time. Me and Lorenzo walk into his house
*  that he rented here in Vegas, and I'm pretty sure it was when Aldo fell out. And we're telling him
*  this, that, and we're looking at some options. He says, I'm going to the gym. When I'm done working
*  out, let me know. He just woke up out of bed. He's in his fucking underwear and he gets hit with this.
*  And he's like, all right, I'm going to the gym. Let me know when I get out who I'm fighting.
*  He doesn't care. Doesn't want to know. Doesn't want any more money. Nothing. Fucking shows up and he
*  delivers. Yeah. So, you know, Connor has been incredibly successful. He's made a lot of money
*  and, you know, he's had his ups and downs outside and inside the octagon. But as for a guy who was,
*  you know, on the dole and was a plumber, he's actually a really smart businessman. And he's
*  been one of the best partners that I've ever had in the history of the sport.
*  And an important part of the history of the UFC. He opened it up to all kinds of new eyes.
*  Yep. He literally, you know, set Europe, Australia, Canada, and many other parts of the world on fire.
*  And he was our first legit megastar. And I personally think he doesn't get enough credit
*  for just how good he was as a fighter. And people love to talk shit about Connor. I suppose that's
*  part of his magic. But it comes with success. Yeah. When you're successful, there's always
*  people out there that are going to talk shit. You know, you always have a bunch of know nothing,
*  do nothing, fucking losers that love to talk shit. You think if you were to do it all over again,
*  Habib is the right matchup? Yeah. Listen, the thing that you can't do is avoid matchups.
*  You know what I mean? This is what we're talking about. When you talk about
*  being a legend, Connor McGregor needed Habib. Habib needed Connor McGregor. You can hate each
*  other as much as you want, but you have to fight these other legendary bad motherfuckers to yourself
*  become a legend. I mean, it's like John Jones needed Cyril Gonn, right? And Cyril Gonn needed
*  John Jones because if Cyril could have beat John, the first guy, if anybody can ever figure it out
*  and beat John Jones, it's a big deal. And it's almost like your obligation as a fighter, right?
*  And when you think about John Jones became who he is today, and the reason I'm sitting here telling
*  you how great he is because all these other guys gave him the opportunity to beat them,
*  right? Or they beat John. It's all about giving these other guys the opportunity. Saint Denis,
*  right? Poirier gave him the opportunity to come in and beat him. That's how this all works.
*  It's the two of them together, the two fighters together. You have to have them both.
*  Listen, I could line up a bunch of no-name bums that John Jones could run through. That's what
*  they do in all the other organizations, right? We would have nothing to fucking talk about right
*  now. That's why, luckily, a perfect record in the UFC is not as important as who you fought,
*  how you fought. So true. But when you have a perfect record in the UFC, holy shit, right?
*  When you can have a perfect record in the UFC, you are absolutely one of the most special athletes
*  on planet Earth. You and Trump are friends. I just talked to Ivanka last night, and I bought
*  her experience in the Miami event. She loves it. She's training too. You're talking about
*  getting girls to train? She's training too. And the kids are training, yeah. Her father's
*  the biggest fucking fight fan on the planet. Calls me all the time to talk about the fights.
*  Don Jr. said that I'm like the only guy on Earth that he bros out with. It's funny when you talk
*  about how powerful fighting is, right? This last Miami event, the president of Ecuador
*  and the president of Spain both posted about the fights, right? Habib beat Connor. Putin was on
*  FaceTime before he even made it to the locker room. Trump, sitting president, ex-president,
*  watching all the fights, calling once to talk about the fights. Valentina Shevchenko, every time she
*  goes home, she meets with the president of the country. The list goes on and on and on. The most
*  powerful Elon Musk, Zuckerberg. I mean, the list goes on and on and on. The most powerful people
*  in the world are all obsessed with fighting. When did you first discover that Trump loves fighting?
*  So I first discovered that Trump was a big fight fan. Obviously, you saw him part of all the big,
*  talking about how big boxing fans we were. He was a part of all the big fights back then. But
*  when we first bought the UFC, this thing was so bad, venues didn't even want us. We ended up doing
*  our first event in the Atlantic City at the Trump Taj Mahal. Now think about this, at that time,
*  Trump ran here, UFC ran. I mean, I can't go low enough. He had us at his venue two times, back to
*  back, showed up for the first fight of the night and stayed till the last fight of the night.
*  Then after that, any good thing that would ever happen to me in my career, Trump would reach out,
*  whether it was we were on the front page of the New York Times at one time, and he said,
*  congratulations, Dana, I always knew you guys were going to do it. Little things like that,
*  but that are big things and mean a lot, especially coming from a guy like him.
*  So he saw something in you, like this is going to be-
*  100%. He definitely saw it. Then comes 15, 16, whenever it was, I don't remember.
*  But he called me and he said, listen, if you don't want to do this, I completely understand.
*  But I would be honored if you would speak at the National Republican Convention for me.
*  I'm not a very political guy, you know what I mean? Everybody told me not to do it. Do not do this.
*  But I was like, why would I not do this? This guy's been great to me, and I did it.
*  Our relationship is just like, you know what I mean? I consider Donald Trump to be one of my
*  very, very good friends. Any favorite stories?
*  There's so many stories. Once he won the election, I'd be at work and I'd be down the hall,
*  was in the matchmaker room, whatever, and my secretary would tell the president's on the phone,
*  fucking come running down the hallway and grab the phone. And he'd want to talk about the fight
*  that was coming up or the fight that happened. Or I'd be in my car and I'd answer the phone.
*  It's like, hi, this is the White House. We have the president of the United States on the phone.
*  That's a trip when that first starts happening. And then just
*  to sum him up, this is the kind of guy that you want to talk about a fighter.
*  It's the most resilient human being I've ever met. If you see the shit that this guy's going
*  through publicly every day, and I'll call him on the phone as a friend and be like, hey, you're
*  like, hey, you're good? How you doing? Unfazed. Unfazed. Like nothing's going on. And he'll start
*  talking to me about this and that and all this other shit. One time. There's only been one time.
*  I've never talked about this publicly, but one time I called him and he was not good.
*  He was a mess. And I've never heard him like that. And I've never seen him like that.
*  When Ivana died. The only time I've ever seen him fucked up. Obviously, as soon as I heard it,
*  I reached out and I have never. Look at all the stuff that's gone on with Trump. All the bad stuff
*  that they say. They're trying to attack him. They're trying to ruin him. Unfazed. I called him that
*  day and he was, this is the first time I've ever seen that guy busted up and not good.
*  But that says something that that's the only time. 100%. That guy is, I mean, walking through fire.
*  He will walk through fire. He's an absolute savage. You think he wins the presidential election?
*  I don't know, man. It's going to depend on how this whole, I, politics is the most dirtiest,
*  scummiest thing on planet earth, man. And, and who knows how this is all going to play out. It's,
*  it's all dirty. It's all ugly. And, you know, obviously I'm rooting for him and, and I'm behind
*  him and I hope he does. But we'll see. What's dirtier? The, the fighting game in the early
*  days or politics? There's nothing dirtier than politics. Nothing. There's literally nothing
*  dirtier. All right. It is the dirtiest thing on planet earth. I just want to get that on record.
*  Another guy who doesn't seem to be fazed by the fire. I've gotten to know him as Elon.
*  I have to ask you, it's a bit, a bit of fun. You were a part of thinking about putting together
*  Zuck versus Elon. I trained with both. I did a phone call with Elon and you when you,
*  when we were training on the mat. You really think that could have been a good fight?
*  It would have been the biggest fight ever done. The spectacle of it.
*  Two of the most powerful, wealthiest men in the world, right? Lots of guys talk shit and go back
*  and forth and sue each other and do all this. These two guys were literally talking about
*  facing each other in the octagon and fighting. There's nothing. And they're in a business
*  that's looked at as geeky. You know what I mean? They're tech nerds. They're this, they're that.
*  These are two dudes that were willing to throw down and fight. And, and, and, and you know,
*  as well as I do, there's a lot of public speculation about this. I was taking serious real time and
*  working on this thing. I mean, I had projections, I had numbers, I was looking at venues. I was on
*  the phone with the fucking Coliseum in Italy, you name it. I was in it. These guys were serious.
*  And this was something that was really going to happen. And I'll tell you right now, the,
*  in the short amount of time that it was, it was going down, it was fun. I was having a blast with
*  it. What do you think about Tyson, Tyson fighting Jake Paul? I love Mike Tyson and I'm not a fan of
*  anybody fighting at our age. But he's a grown man obviously. And, you know, he's going to do
*  what he's going to do. But at least I know I talked to, I talked to his wife a couple of days ago
*  and he's taken this serious and he's trained it for it. And, you know, so we'll see how it plays
*  out. Why do you think he fights though? Like, what is that about? Is there a broader lesson
*  there about fighters? Well, I think that Mike Tyson is actually one of those unique guys who
*  has crossed over any of these other boxers from his era. They have no way of making money other
*  than fighting. Mike Tyson has made a lot of money outside of fighting. I mean, Tyson still has that
*  aura. You could be at a restaurant and he walks in and you're like, holy fuck, Mike Tyson's here.
*  He still has that type of aura and energy in a room. And he makes lots of money outside of
*  the ring. I think that he ends up getting these offers that he can't refuse.
*  Oh, you think it's financial? So how much, I mean, that's a good question to ask.
*  You work with a lot of fighters. For how many of them is it about money and for how many is it
*  about the fact, the pure love of fighting? Well, the guys that get into it for the right reason
*  are the guys who get into it for greatness because you want to be the fucking best.
*  And when you're in it for that reason, you love it and you want to be looked at as the best ever
*  and you have the talent, the money happens. Then you have other guys who get in. I believe
*  I've dealt with fighters who just wanted to be famous and just wanted to make money.
*  You know what I mean? And it's, you know, listen, it is what it is. It's your life and you live it
*  the way that you want and do your thing. But the ones that are beloved are the guys who really want
*  to be fucking great. And they're the ones that are remembered. And I mean, when you look at Tyson
*  in his early years, when he came up under Kostya Mato, I mean, he was a student of the game.
*  He loved everything. He became completely infatuated with the fight game. Then he became
*  such a massive superstar. It's almost like the whole thing starts to turn on you. You know,
*  all the things that come at you at a young age and that kind of money. And it's tough. It's tough to
*  navigate and get through. And you know, you say something like that, people are like, oh, poor
*  him. He had fucking a hundred million dollars and couldn't, at that age and with all the shit that
*  people talk and all the things that you got to put up with and the fame. A lot of people deal
*  with fame. Some people handle it really well and some people don't. And the perfect example
*  of that was Forrest Griffin and Stefan Bonner. You know, they fought that unbelievable fight
*  on the ultimate fighter. Everything blew up after that. Forrest dealt with fame really well and Stefan
*  did not. That was a special fight. Really was. What do you think attracted people to that fight?
*  So that was a big leap for the UFC. It was everything. It was everything. Why do you think
*  people loved that fight? What attracted people to that fight? Why did they change everything?
*  Well, what happened that night is the rest of the show was a disaster. You know, we had the co-main
*  event and the main event. Diego Sanchez ran through Kenny Florian in seconds. Oh my God,
*  that was terrible. And the fights that led up to that weren't anything to talk about either.
*  Then Stefan and Forrest got in there and just went toe to toe in this unbelievable slugfest,
*  live on free television when cable still mattered. And what I heard was at the time,
*  you know, you had people picking up the phone going, are you watching this show?
*  The numbers just started climbing. Then you got a razor thin decision. Who's going to win?
*  You got the crowd stomping their feet. It sounded like a train was going through the place and
*  everybody's chanting one more round. Me and the Fertitta brothers get together and we talk.
*  We're going to give them both contracts. So we give them both contracts and the place erupts.
*  It just, it couldn't have been a more perfect fight at the most perfect time. And it just,
*  it all came together. It's almost like this was meant to be. You know what I mean? So we had
*  so many problems with Spike TV at the time, right? Because halfway through the season,
*  the president of the company got fired. All the things that we thought we were going to get
*  that year, you know, we have this runaway hit show. And normally at that time, when you would
*  see runaway hit shows, there'd be commercials, it'd be on billboards, it'd be on the side of buses
*  in LA and New York. We got none of that, right? We didn't even know if we were going to get a,
*  you know, a second season coming out of that. Right. And when that fight was over, I swear to
*  God, I was like, I don't even give a fuck. We're going to end up somewhere now after this fight.
*  And we didn't even make it out of the building that night. The Spike guys did the contract with
*  us in the alley on a fucking napkin after the fight. So you saw the, you already saw the magic
*  of the fight itself. It happened and all the shit. And at that time, I didn't know what the ratings,
*  not like we were streaming and we could see what we were, we had no idea, but I knew.
*  You just knew this was going to happen. I knew. What is it? It's like just two people being willing
*  to stand toe to toe and just go to war. And when you think about what was at stake,
*  there was a car. Remember the Kia? The winner got a Kia, right? That's what was the fucking,
*  right? And Stefan and Forrest, the will to win, they both wanted to win that fight so bad.
*  It was bigger than the Kia probably. You know, Forrest drove that Kia to like
*  200,000 miles. The biggest mistake Kia ever made was not doing a fucking commercial with Forrest
*  Griffin about that car. Forrest Griffin loved that car so much he drove it. I think he still has it.
*  It's got like 200,000 miles on it. I mean, you couldn't have a better commercial than that.
*  And we reached out to him too. I said, Kia should know about this. They fucking blew it.
*  You know how those guys are in the business world. They don't fucking get anything.
*  Maybe it was about the Kia then. It was about winning. They both wanted to win the ultimate
*  fighter so bad. It's the Kia. It's the win. It's the contract you get, the whole thing.
*  But I think at that point, even if you get all of that when you're in there,
*  you probably just, there's the primal thing where like, I'm not backing down.
*  They're both bad dudes. They were both real fighters at the end of the day. That's why the
*  fight was so great. You know what I mean? Just throw it all, all the caution to the win and just
*  fight. Those are some of the greatest moments in the FC too when the technique is not kind of falls
*  apart and you're just like, fuck it. It's because you're in those deep rounds. You've been through
*  a war. Now it's all about heart and dog. Who can dig deeper and who's got it and who wants it.
*  Who wants it? I mean, we all know when that moment happens in a fight, when you see that
*  both of these guys are fucking exhausted. And for people that are watching this,
*  people that don't know a lot of, everybody thinks they know a lot about fighting. 99.9% of the people
*  out there don't know jack shit about fighting or what it takes to do what these people do.
*  But when you get into those later rounds and fatigue sets in and then fatigue makes you start
*  to fucking doubt yourself. And then you start to wonder, can I even make it through the rest of
*  this round? And then you start to think, am I going to fucking die right now? And these kids
*  dig fucking deep and they just, like you said, all the other shit flies out the window. And now
*  they're just on fucking autopilot to fight and win. Those are definitely the best fights you'll
*  ever see in any combat sport. I mean, that saying is true. Like the exhaustion makes cowards of us
*  all. I mean, there's something about it because I've competed a lot in jiu-jitsu.
*  There's the violence of being hit too, but even just exhaustion, it makes you question everything.
*  So true. It just takes you to some weird place where your brain starts to think you're going
*  to die for sure. Your brain starts to think like, why am I doing this? All these excuses, all this.
*  I love that shit.
*  And then the truly heroic action is to say, fuck it in that moment and just to get in there.
*  When you think about these fights that you see in the UFC every fucking Saturday, when these
*  these men and women get to this point where they've been in a dogfight, yet they keep fucking going
*  and you keep trying to win. You can't imagine what's going on inside their heads, self-doubt,
*  all these other things that come into play when exhaustion sets in and they fucking power through
*  it. Yeah. Those moments, sometimes they don't have a glorious knockout at the end, but
*  your decision in the third round or the fifth round to still keep pushing forward, not running.
*  That doesn't matter what happened. That is a person winning a battle over themselves.
*  So true. It's so true. And it happens every fucking weekend. It's so impressive. I say it
*  all the time. The people that are involved in this sport are this much of the population.
*  The people that make it to the top five are incredibly unique, special human beings, man.
*  It's fucking awesome.
*  You love gambling.
*  I do.
*  What's the biggest win of your gambling career?
*  Maybe psychologically, if not financially.
*  Well, two things. I won a million dollar hand one night. It's happened one time.
*  A million dollar hand one night at Mandalay Bay. And then one summer, I beat Caesar's for 12 million
*  throughout the summer.
*  Throughout the summer.
*  Yeah. And then I'm on a pretty good run right now too.
*  This is Blackjack. What's the biggest loss?
*  Biggest loss was... I would call this the biggest loss for many different reasons.
*  You live and you learn in life and you figure things out as you go along.
*  So one night I'm over at the Rio. They got big suites over there. So I go over there with some
*  buddies and we got one of the suites and we have some dinner and we start drinking. So we're having
*  some drinks at dinner and blah, blah, blah. Starts to ramp up, having a good time. And
*  I make my way down to the Thai limit room. We start gambling.
*  And I continue to drink, having a blast. I end up leaving and going home that night and I lost
*  like 80 grand. So I wake up the next morning and I'm like, fuck those motherfuckers got me for 80,000
*  last night and da, da, da, da, da. So I'm at work the next day and the host over there calls me and
*  he says, hey, Dana, are you coming back? Do you still need the room that you guys had where you
*  ate and all this shit? And I said, no, I don't need the room, but don't get too comfortable with my
*  fucking 80 grand. I'm coming back for it. Dead fucking silence on the other end of the phone.
*  And he's like, Dana, you lost $3 million last night. What the fuck are you talking about?
*  I only have a million and a half dollar credit line. He goes, yeah, you made us call the GM of
*  the hotel and you started calling him a fucking pussy and da, da, da, da. And I went, yeah,
*  that sounds like something I would do. Yeah. So that's the real number.
*  That was the real number. And then there's been a lot of cases where people are in Vegas and they're
*  like, um, Oh, you know, I lost all this money, you know, and they were giving me free drinks
*  and I drank too much and I was taken advantage of. No, no, you stupid motherfucker, man up.
*  You got fucking drunk, right? They didn't, alcohol is free, but you don't have to drink it.
*  You know what I mean? And you know, this, this was a huge learning lesson for me. So I never drank
*  again when I, when I was playing cards after that night. But yeah, when you ask me, that's the one
*  that stands out most as far as having a bad loss. And then, you know, of course I said, call the GM
*  and I started calling him a pussy at three o'clock in the morning. So that is something I would
*  absolutely do. How do you deal with those psychologically? Do you, uh, when you gamble,
*  maybe this applies to fighting too. Do you love winning or hate losing more?
*  They go hand in hand. So the way that I, that I play is I live in Vegas. So
*  2024 is a war for me. I go to war in 24. Okay. All these nights that I play are little battles
*  inside the war that I will fight in 24. Now at the end of the year, we will tell, you know,
*  tally up all these little battles and see where I stand on when wins and losses. And, um,
*  you know, there's, there's lots of talk about, out there about my gambling, you know, places that
*  I've been kicked out of and things like that. And I, I, I do pretty well. I do pretty well,
*  but it's, it's, it's what I like to do. You know, I, I don't gamble in a way that I would ever hurt
*  myself or hurt my family or, uh, you know, I'm sure you've heard the Norm MacDonald stories.
*  Norm MacDonald lost like his entire personal wealth four times or something like that. Um,
*  yeah, that's, that's not going to happen to me. So you, you, you manage it, but just psychologically,
*  you're able to be even. So, so when I win, it's awesome. It's always great to win winning
*  is a great feeling in business and sports and life and definitely in gambling. Um, losing is,
*  is, is never fun, but it's part of the game. You know what I mean? If, if you want to be in the game
*  and it's sports, it's business or whatever, there's going to be wins and there's going to be losses
*  and you have to take them both in stride and you have to be able to, you know, um, there's a lot of
*  people when you gamble, right. And you lose and you go into a deep dark depression. I've seen this
*  with guys that do it, get depressed and gambling isn't for you. You know, if you are the type of
*  person that's on social media and people say horrible things to you and you get depressed and
*  that you shouldn't be on social media, you know what I mean? These are all part of being in the
*  game. When you're in the game, great things happen and really bad things happen and you
*  got to take it all in stride and you got to pick yourself up the next day, strap your fucking shoes
*  back on and get out there and go to fucking war again. That's how it works. That's some
*  Goggins shit right there. All right. I love that motivational speech. Uh, it's the truth though.
*  Yeah, it is. It's the truth though. Listen, every day when you get out of bed, life's standing right
*  there to kick you in the face, man. Could be anything. Could be you get up and you walk
*  downstairs, you had a flat tire and you're late for work and you got this and that life is going
*  to throw all kinds of crazy shit at you, right? And you have to be ready for it and you got to
*  fucking deal with it. You can't curl up into a ball. You can't run away from it. You can't hide.
*  You have to take all this shit head on. You have to get up every day when I get up for out of bed,
*  I strap up and I'm getting ready for fucking war because I know I'm coming in here. I know a bunch
*  of bad shit's going to happen that I'm going to fucking deal with. And if that's not bad enough,
*  when I finally get out of here, I'm probably going to go to the casino and I'm going to get into
*  another fucking war. You know what I mean? I thrive in chaos. I actually love chaos.
*  Everybody talks about retiring. Fuck that shit. What am I going to do when I retire? What would I
*  do? What would I, I like to go to war. I like to battle. I like to win. Sometimes I lose,
*  but then I have to come back from the loss. And I love to build brands. I love to set short-term
*  and long-term goals and then knock them all down. This is just the stuff that excites me.
*  And whether it's business or gambling, I like being a fan of things too. I like live music.
*  So when I find a band that I like, I get excited to go watch the band live or Celtics game. I love
*  the fucking Boston Celtics and I love going to the games and watching them. This is the year.
*  Hopefully we're going to fucking win it this year. These are all things that make me happy
*  and excite me in my life. And it's funny because there's this post that I post maybe three,
*  four nights a week. I also love this city. I can't tell if the city of Las Vegas was built for me
*  or I was built for this fucking city, but I love it. And there's this turn on Summerlin Parkway,
*  right? Every night and it's dark. And from there, you can see the entire fucking city
*  and it's all fucking lights and it's badass. And I'm usually driving home after a fucking
*  incredible day, right? This amazing day and this unbelievable fucking life that I have.
*  And I have this just moment of gratitude. Every time I take that turn and I'm like,
*  God damn, I love this fucking city. And just every night when I go home,
*  I'm just so happy and grateful for this life that I have.
*  So you're grateful, you're celebrating, even if the day is full of shit,
*  full of problems you have to solve all of this, you're still able to put that behind you.
*  I love that too. I love problem solving. I love taking things that seem impossible.
*  What's been shit on more than this fucking company right here? Power slap, right?
*  Yeah. This thing's a fucking beast. It's an absolute beast. In 13 months,
*  that's the most successful thing I've ever been a part of. And I love every fucking minute of it,
*  especially the negativity. I love negativity. So you almost feed on it. That's great.
*  I eat that shit for fucking breakfast, man. I love it.
*  What's your favorite movie about Vegas? Casino?
*  Yeah, it would have to be Casino. No doubt about it.
*  You ever see a movie that changed your life, that actually impacted your life in some way,
*  shape or form? Probably.
*  Which one? That's a good question. I have to think.
*  Well, I have a lot, a lot, because Casino could be one of them. Probably talking about women.
*  Forrest Gump, for me, it's a simple movie, but it was a really good movie to show.
*  I've been really fortunate in my life, over and over and over. I don't think I deserve any of it.
*  I just always felt like Forrest Gump. When I finally saw it, it really connected with me.
*  It was like, okay, this universe works in weird ways and stuff just materializes.
*  You just kind of be good to people, put that good karma out there and it happens for you.
*  So that was a movie like that.
*  I'm actually very superstitious about that. I believe that what you put out, you get back.
*  I believe that when you have, you should take care of other people and you should always try to
*  bring people up with you and all that kind of stuff. But the movie that changed the whole
*  trajectory of my life was Vision Quest.
*  Well, yeah, that's a good one too.
*  Vision Quest, man. I fucking love that movie. It's basically, you know, it's telling the story of
*  a kid who really wasn't anybody in high school and nobody kind of knew who he was, who wasn't
*  popular or any of that kind of shit. And he decided that that was the year that he was
*  going to make his mark. And he was a good wrestler at 178 pounds, but he was going to move
*  down to 160 something to take on the shoot, the scariest guy and the whatever.
*  But there's all these little things in the movie that really lay out what life is all about.
*  One of the parts is he's in a class and he's talking about, the teacher is talking about some
*  poem and he says, what does this poem mean to you? Well, this little girl's walking through
*  the park and all the leaves are falling off the trees and she realizes that she's going to die
*  someday and that a lot of people think they have all this time, so they fucking waste it.
*  And they never go out and do what they really set out to do or accomplish or do anything great in
*  their life. That's one meaning. Then he's got the guy that he works with at work. He's cutting
*  weight and his nose is bleeding and all this shit. And this guy keeps going, why the fuck are you
*  doing this? Pick that thing up and eat it like a fucking man. This is ridiculous. I don't know why
*  you're doing this to yourself, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So then when he meets the girl and
*  he gets to the point where he feels like he wants to quit, right? Where does he go? He goes to that
*  guy's fucking apartment because he knows when he shows up at this guy's apartment, he's going to
*  go, yeah, fuck this shit. No, he went to work. He went to work to talk to him and he wasn't at work.
*  He took the night off. So he shows up at the fucking house, the shitty little fucking apartment
*  that the guy lives in and the guy's putting a suit and tie on and shit. He's like, they said you
*  called in sick. What's going on? He's like, well, yeah, aren't you wrestling this guy tonight? And
*  he's like, yeah, but why would you, you're going to get docked a night's pay and all this other
*  shit. He says, you know what, man? Then it all gets laid out. I get the goosebumps even telling
*  you this fucking part of the- Is that the Pelé speech?
*  Pelé. Yeah. When he's saying about, you know, I'm fucking cooking in an overnight hotel
*  fucking thing and I live in this shitty apartment. A human being can lift himself upside down and
*  backwards and kick a ball into a fucking net and the whole stadium goes crazy. And this guy runs
*  around and I'm sitting here in my fucking apartment alone and I start crying. Yeah, I start crying.
*  So the guy who's been shitting on him the whole fucking time actually really respects him for
*  what he's done and sees what this kid is capable of doing and all this shit. This just, this fucking
*  movie spoke to me on so many different levels. And I think it's probably the most underrated movie
*  of all time. When you really break down the meaning of what this movie is about
*  and it fucking really spoke to me. That's probably the greatest movie on one-on-one combat.
*  I would agree. Ever made. I would agree. Yeah. And especially if you can really
*  hear the messages that it's given you in this movie, it's excellent. You know, it's funny.
*  They just did like the, and I saw this after the fact, which completely fucking pissed me off.
*  They did like the 25 year or the 30 year thing. It was filmed in Spokane, Washington. They showed
*  the movie at a movie theater there and the cast members came out and spoke about it. I would have
*  fucking flown there for that. Are you shitting me? I'd have been there in fucking 30 seconds to go
*  up there and be a part of that. That movie literally changed my life. Yeah. I suppose me too.
*  It made me want to wrestle. I mean, probably the reason I was, maybe it made me fall in love with
*  wrestling. Well, you know, it's funny. I wasn't even into wrestling at all and I didn't have to
*  be for that movie to, yeah, it's the basic human story. It's such a great movie. I mean,
*  that's what fighting does. It brings out the basic, like the humanity of a person really,
*  like if the, for the people that choose to step up and step in the ring and then chase greatness
*  and actually do it from like against the long odds. That's why it's a beautiful game. And it's so
*  true. I mean, when you think about like, I'm 54 years old right now, like that, I mean,
*  it just fucking flew by. And you think when you're young that you have all this time,
*  you have no time. There's no time. I mean, one of the quotes on the wall and the gym in there is,
*  you know, there is no tomorrow from Rocky three, you know, there is no tomorrow. Fuck that shit.
*  Let's, let's, let's get all this shit done today. Do you think about your death?
*  I'm not afraid of death. Not even a little bit. I'm not afraid of it. I don't know if that'll be
*  the case when I'm facing it, you know, when I'm looking down the barrel of it, laying in a hospital
*  bed somewhere. But for now, just squeezing as much as you can out of it. I literally, I don't even
*  like to sleep. My life is so fucking awesome. I don't even want to go to bed at night. I don't
*  even want to go to sleep. I want to stay up fucking. I wish I could fucking do 24 hours and
*  never have to sleep. That's how much I love my life. What has watching thousands of fights over
*  the years taught you about human nature, about us humans? I don't care what color you are,
*  what country you come from, what language you speak. We're all human beings. Fighting's in our
*  DNA. We get it and we like it. And it's true. Fighting is in our DNA. It's a part of who we are.
*  And, you know, no matter where you are, if a fight breaks out, it creates this fucking energy,
*  this buzz, this sense of fear. I mean, a lot of different emotions happen in people when fights
*  break out. But one thing that is always the case, everybody's watching, man. Everybody's
*  fucking, all of their eyes are on the fight. I mean, we were just in Mexico.
*  Fucking fight broke out like in the good seats, like right here with these seats. They're super
*  expensive and security never fucking came. They just let these guys fight until they gassed out.
*  And then everybody put their chairs back together and sat back down and fucking.
*  I literally got up from my table, walked over and was watching this fight at the fights.
*  At the fights. Yeah. I mean, humans fight and humans love watching fighting.
*  Absolutely. And that was my thought process going into buying the UFC.
*  And I believe that this would work everywhere. And thank God we were right.
*  Well, Dana, thank you for bringing this very human thing of fighting, the art of it,
*  the science of it, the heroic stories, the vision quest stories of it all.
*  Boom. I really appreciate you talking to me, brother.
*  Thank you. Pleasure, buddy. Thank you for the kind words.
*  Thanks for listening to this conversation with Dana White. To support this podcast,
*  please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from
*  Muhammad Ali. Impossible is just a big word thrown around by small men who find it easier
*  to live in a world they've been given than to explore the power they have to change it.
*  Impossible is not a fact. It's an opinion. Impossible is not a declaration. It's a dare.
*  Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
