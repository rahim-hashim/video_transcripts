# Dan Reynolds Imagine Dragons  Lex Fridman Podcast #290
**Lex Fridman:** [May 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvGZkf87aCs)
*  When you imagine a song, is it the opening you imagine?
*  No, it's kind of a, it's just a, I never think opening, I never think final, I think
*  soundscape of how I'm feeling right now. So it could be the middle of the song for all I know
*  when I'm, you know, when I'm doing that. But my process for me is very much lyrics and melody
*  and music really come at the same time. Like I, by same time I mean I'm, I'm, as I'm expressing maybe,
*  you know, I'm feeling like, like it's not that simple, but it's like I'll, I'll hear it, like
*  it's like here's all the orchestra and you're kind of just pressing all the buttons at once. And
*  melody and my voice is just one of those instruments.
*  The following is a conversation with Dan Reynolds, the lead singer of Imagine Dragons,
*  one of the most popular bands in the world with over 75 million records sold and with four songs
*  being streamed over a billion times on Spotify. Given all that, Dan is one of the most down to
*  earth, kind, thoughtful and fascinating human beings I've ever met. Grounded in part by his
*  lifelong struggle with mental health. The darkness, the love and the creative brilliance
*  are all there in this one humble mind. For this reason and many others we became fast friends.
*  Plus he recently started his journey in programming, which funny enough is where we
*  start this wide ranging, deeply personal and fun conversation. This is the Lex Friedman podcast.
*  To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now dear friends,
*  here's Dan Reynolds. So we were talking offline that you're not just getting into programming.
*  What's the most beautiful program you've ever written? Something that brought you joy?
*  There's something I really love completion. It's the reason that I'm addicted to songwriting. I
*  like there being nothing and then having some blocks or tools and building them into what you
*  want it to look like. And then I find it incredibly rewarding to stand back and look at what you did
*  at the end. It could be anything for me. It was as simple to begin with as just because it's
*  object oriented, like making a cube move. Simple as that. Understanding that and knowing that I
*  built that and made it do that is really rewarding. And I think it's the thing that drew me into
*  wanting to learn more. But as far as what is some grandiose, like some big piece of code that I've
*  done, like absolutely not. I'm still a level where it's more like what is a tutorial that I followed
*  and got. And then, yeah, so I couldn't say I'm at a level where I've done anything beautiful at all
*  in code. But you're also interested in potentially, like your heart is drawn to creating games.
*  Creating anything.
*  And completing it. That's the feel good is this done.
*  Yeah. I mean, I've been working over the last two years with actually a team out of Kiev
*  on, and we can get into that, it's a whole other story, but on a computer game. And really have
*  kept that kind of under wraps. But yeah, we're kind of getting to a point now where we have a
*  prototype that we can play and it's a lot of fun. And thankfully all the team members are in safe
*  places now. Things have obviously been on hold for a little bit, but when that started is when I
*  really decided, okay, I need to understand base level coding and C sharp. So I'm not an idiot
*  talking to these people. And so it's, yeah, we've been doing that for a couple of years.
*  So are there any parallels between the final completion that you feel with programming,
*  which I think is a little bit more definitive. Like there's debugging, the code doesn't work,
*  it's messy and so on. There's the early design stages. You're not sure like how to have functions
*  and classes, how it's all going to work. And then it comes together and it's really done because it
*  works and there's a cube moving on the screen. Is there any parallels between that and music?
*  Because are you really ever done, done with a song?
*  It's exactly the same thing for me just in that it's art. I really believe that we have not fully
*  encapsulated artists. Like when we say art, I think most people think, okay, the medium must be
*  painting or drawing or music or writing. But I really believe anytime you're creating some things,
*  engineers, for instance, you're creating something with tools that you have
*  and it can be incredibly beautiful. And so yeah, I think, and it's never done.
*  I feel like I look at songs that I've done and I never felt
*  you have to let go or I have to let go. And that's all I've, I'm just continually making myself
*  let go. But I look at songs that I've done and wish I had done more or kept going down that road
*  and what would have happened. And I'm really contained to because of what our band is and
*  what our fans expect. And there's so much more to it that it's like I'm fitting in a box always.
*  This song shouldn't be longer than three minutes and 30 seconds. And I don't know if I remember
*  the chorus after I heard it. Maybe I need to hear the chorus three times instead of those two times.
*  Especially in pop music, it's really hard to,
*  yeah, it feels like there's confines even though people are like, well, there's no confines,
*  but still everybody's writing a pop song that's a few minutes.
*  Are those explicit in your mind or are they just kind of, the gut is like you said, chorus,
*  should you have chorus once, twice or three times? Is that a gut thing or is that a rule thing?
*  You know, I think it's a rule. I mean, it's obviously a rule I impose on myself. Nobody's,
*  nobody's in my house saying, hey, Dan, if you don't do this, I'm going to punish you.
*  There's no major label president that's like, imagine dragons needs to make pop music, Dan.
*  You know what I mean? My manager doesn't even tell me that. I do it because it's what I perceive to
*  be enjoyable. I grew up listening to a ton of pop music and then I ended up being in what is
*  quote unquote a rock band, which I've never perceived it as that, but that's kind of what
*  the world has called it and that's fine. So you're a prisoner of a prison that you
*  yourself constructed. There you go. The confines are yours.
*  I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm a happy prisoner of the prison that I have created for
*  myself and I made that prison thinking that it was a mansion.
*  So you worked with Rick Rubin. What does Rick think about your prison?
*  Rick, Rick was, you know, it was interesting to hear his outside opinion when we first met
*  because my biggest focus for so much of my life, my biggest fear was, and this stems from, I think,
*  middle schools when it started, but everyone being in on a joke except for yourself.
*  The thought of thinking you're good at something and really you're terrible at it and you're
*  surrounded by people who are saying, yeah, you're good at it and then by themselves are like,
*  he's terrible at this. And not just in regards to music or art, but anything in life. And I think
*  maybe from having six older brothers, it stems from that too, like always feeling inadequate
*  and like the annoying younger brother. But anyway, so Rick's, and that's something I've learned to
*  let go of as I've gotten older and had life experiences. But one of the things that Rick
*  said really early on that has stuck with me was he said, yeah, we were Zooming the first time we
*  met. He said, I'd really like to work with you because I feel like you're not confined to a sound.
*  You've done a lot of different sounds. And so it's exciting because I feel like your fans are
*  forgiving more than other rock bands or bands. Because most people, when they hear a band,
*  it's like there's a very specific sound with it. It's like they do folk music or they do California
*  rock or they do surf or they do, and your fans kind of want that. They want them to do that
*  thing and then they don't do it. And sometimes that goes well, but a lot of times it doesn't.
*  And people, critics and everybody is like, go back to the thing that you did good and do that.
*  Rick felt whether he was right or wrong that we could do, we hop genres so much. And that's been
*  to our benefit and detriment, I think. Why detriment? Because people want you to be
*  something. It's more, you can believe it more. It's more authentic if you never change.
*  I guess. I don't know. I mean, certainly it's not something I subscribe to because I create music.
*  But I also grew up listening to a lot of different genres. I would listen to Cat Stevens
*  and the next song would be Biggie and then the next song would be Nirvana.
*  It was like, I like a lot of, and then Billy Joel and then Enya. It was like, you know what I mean?
*  I was a product, and I was a product of the 90s, which if you listen to 90s music, it really was
*  a lot of reason that people say, well, 90s were terrible. A lot of people say that. I love the
*  90s were my favorite decade of music. There was a lot of genre hopping and I don't know, I love that.
*  She had the 90s had the boy bands and it had Pearl Jam and Nirvana.
*  And it had a lot of, like Women of the 90s is probably my biggest influence.
*  Like kind of that like angry rock women of the 90s, like Lannis Morissette, Jagged Little Pill
*  is one of my favorite records of all time. The lyrics were so intimate and I don't know
*  if she was angry or not. Sorry if she wasn't. Yeah, but there was an anger to it. There was
*  angst. Yeah, it was like angstiness. And that in hip hop of the 90s influences me. And then my dad.
*  So anything my dad listened to, which my dad didn't listen to any of that. My dad listened to
*  Harry Nelson, The Beatles, Cat Stevens, Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, Billy Joel. It was very much like singer
*  songwriter. Do you mind if we throughout this listen to a few songs? Because you mentioned
*  here in this and I was actually yesterday and the day before listening to a lot of his stuff. And
*  it's just like, damn, he's good. And not as known as he should be. Like I was getting a,
*  do you mind if I play? Oh, please. Yeah. I don't know. Not to, not to open this conversation with
*  a love song. I would like that actually. But without you is an incredible song. Oh man, that's, yeah.
*  And the heartbreak in the, in the longing.
*  What? He's the best to do it. In my opinion, in my opinion, he's the best to do it.
*  The vocal range. And just the sadness of like,
*  like there's something I don't even want to talk over. And because I, this is one of my favorite
*  songs too, but I think people have a really good bullshit indicator and music in my opinion,
*  whenever I meet a young artist and say, well, let's, I'm trying to make a new band and I want
*  to do something like how to be successful. I really think understanding that people have a
*  really good bullshit indicator is the most important part of being an artist. And I'll
*  explain what that means, at least to me. I think that in order to have success or be a leader or
*  whether it's an art or anything, people need to believe that you believe what you're doing.
*  Um, I think the best actors really, when they're doing their thing, it's like they,
*  it's not acting. They're, they're in it and it's how they feel. And they're expressing that sorrow
*  or joy or whatever it is. Harry, for me, Harry Nelson, he, I just believe it. He could, he sings
*  that and I, I feel it. And whether he's the greatest bullshitter of all time or I don't think
*  that's the case. I think he probably was singing that song and he, he just could transport himself
*  to wherever he was. It's what makes a great live act. It's what makes a great song. And someone
*  could be the best actor and sing that in the same timber, same EQ, same compression, same everything.
*  And there's some unknown there that I, you know, I don't, I think it hopefully it will be known at
*  some point. It's some scientific thing, but there's something there that the energy or something
*  that people can perceive it and say, true or false. And if it resonates as true, it's so much more
*  meaningful and it lives on. And if it doesn't, that for me is what is good art or bad. Like
*  for people to dispute over, like, well, Sonic's should sound like that's silly to me. It's like
*  a song or, or, or even a painting. Like it's just the truthfulness of it.
*  Yeah. The, the truly great art goes, has to go to that place where you really are feeling it.
*  Like you forget that you're being recorded. You forget there's an audience. You really are feeling
*  it. Yeah. Which I totally agree with you. One of the things that I love about the internet
*  is it's brought the bullshit detector of the masses to power, which is beautiful because then
*  the masses uplift the really authentic. Right. And even if you didn't write the song, I think it
*  helps a lot probably if you wrote the song, but you know, I was, I was, I was a little bit, maybe a
*  lot since we're in Vegas, a little heartbroken that to find out that Elvis didn't write his songs.
*  But I like, for example, rocket man, Elton John, like to find out that Elton John didn't really know
*  where the words of rocket man came from, meaning like the depths of it. It's interesting,
*  but nevertheless, he's super authentic because for Elton John and for Elvis, there's something in the,
*  in the fun and the darkness and the entertainment of it. Like he goes to some place in his mind
*  that might not be deeply connected from where the lyrics came from, but he relates it. He relates
*  it to whatever is in his mind and goes to that place emotionally. Yeah. And that's what I think
*  it is. And that's why an actor, like I said, can be completely honest to me. Maybe they didn't write
*  the script, but I write, like I've always written all my own lyrics. It's a really personal thing
*  to me, but I will say I see people all the time who are performers like Elton John, for instance,
*  who didn't write the lyrics that I believe that they, it means just as much to them as what I
*  wrote because they find the meaning in it for themselves, at least the greats do. And I think
*  that that's the difference maker. And I think you can perceive, and I'm sure you've seen art
*  that doesn't move you and maybe it moves someone else, but for you, for some reason you perceive it
*  to be uninteresting to you. And I feel like a lot of the time I'm saying that it's of course,
*  sonically, maybe it's uninteresting to you, but I think the majority of the time for myself,
*  I can find inspiration in any sonic value or painting as long as I see it. And I feel truth
*  from the person that created it. Yeah. But for me, the lyrics, maybe not the entirety of the lyrics,
*  but a few words can do wonders to take you to a place. And sometimes those words don't need to
*  be connected with the other words. That's the beauty of music. They're allowed to float in the
*  space of mixed metaphors. They're allowed to just jump around and somehow it paints a picture
*  without actually, what is it, glycerine by Bush. Right. But it's also how the person says it,
*  right? It's like, it's the feeling of exactly, and the same person could say that word 10 other
*  ways and you don't care, but someone says glycerine or whatever it is. And it's like, oh, you know
*  what? I feel that. The way he said that, he meant it to me. You know what I mean?
*  No, I can't forget this evening or your face as you were leaving, but I guess that's just the way
*  the story goes. You always smile, but in your eyes, your sorrow shows. Yes, it shows.
*  Let me ask you to analyze the song. Do you, so there's a, there's a lady possibly who's leaving
*  him. Do you think he's leaving her or she's leaving him? She wants to.
*  And then the chorus says, I can't live if living is without you. Can't live. I can't give anymore.
*  He's got a voice on him. Yeah, he does. And if you really, there's been some incredible
*  documentation on his life and the end of his life. And so my answer to this is probably skewed
*  based on what I've seen about his life too, but he, he was a real alcoholic at the end of his life
*  and it destroyed his voice and ended up killing him as well.
*  And so when I hear that, I perceive it as
*  someone who is destructive and in a destructive place in life and can't love someone properly.
*  And so they can't live with them, but they can't live without them type thing, which is really
*  something that I really identify with. And I think is, you know, one of the struggles of life is
*  loving yourself enough. It's forgiving yourself for, for things and letting yourself love someone
*  else. And, you know, at least when I listened to that, I hear Harry being like,
*  and maybe I'm wrong, but this is how I perceive it at least is
*  not loving himself and feeling like he's deserving of this person. Like I have to let you go. I hear
*  that, of course, and people are saying, oh, well, he's breaking up with her, but there's so much
*  more complexity and nuance to relationships in that knife. And for instance, my wife and I went
*  through really difficult separation. And I think that's one of the things that I think is
*  really important. And that's, you know, a story for another day or different question or something,
*  but the nuance of it makes me think of this when I hear this, which is there's just more
*  to being with someone or not being with someone than, Hey, I think that person's really attractive
*  or Hey, that person makes me laugh or not, or I love them. And now I don't love them.
*  I think that's a complex nuanced thing that a lot of times there's just more going on behind the
*  scenes, I think.
*  Yeah. On a small tangent on that, just as a curious question, have you paid any attention
*  to the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard trials?
*  I have watched quite a bit of it because my wife really loves it and she watches it in bed at night.
*  So it's raw. Like to me, it's really, cause you, you've mentioned how complicated love can be.
*  And it's, I've never seen, I don't care about the celebrity nature of it. I don't care if it was,
*  I don't care who it is, but it's just laid out in such raw form, the, uh, for the world to see it,
*  for the world to see the toxicity, but also the passion and, and the clearly sort of, uh,
*  the drugs and the drinking, but also like the longing and the dreams and I will always be
*  with you. I will die for you. The, the, the places, the, the roller coaster of love, and it's all
*  there at the end, past the end. So it's like, um, I've also recently reread the rise and fall of the
*  third Reich about, uh, Hitler Nazi Germany. It's the rise and the fall. And it's interesting to
*  look at the entirety of that process after it's all over many, many decades after it's all over
*  that book in particular written by the person that was actually there.
*  And so here we're seeing two people in the context of the courtroom analyzing this rise and fall of
*  a love affair. It's fascinating. You know, the truth is I was telling my wife this actually just
*  the other day, cause she was asking me when I thought about it. It makes me really sad.
*  It's, it's humorous. Don't get me wrong. There's a lot of parts in it that are just really funny,
*  like, but I look at it and I also see the internet and you know, someone's always the villain and
*  someone's the hero, which is such a funny thing. And we, we talked a little about this offline
*  before we got on this, but I have a real firm belief in life that it's just more complex than
*  you think. Always, always. And we, and Johnny, for instance, is very charismatic and you, you love
*  him and he's funny and this way he does things and he looks certain ways and he says things.
*  He's just, you really love him. And I feel like, and maybe I'm wrong on this, but it looks like the
*  internet is really living like Johnny is the winner. Amber is, is the villain. And I kind of
*  look at it and I kind of look at it and I feel like, were any of you in their bedroom? Like,
*  were any of you there for these things? And I'm not saying one way or the other, like the,
*  all I see when I look at that is two people with a lot of deep seated hurt, anger, and that anger
*  is so poisonous to both of them and they're, and they're getting through it in the way that
*  they only know how. And I'm not saying we should, you know, we shouldn't be able to look at parts of
*  it and laugh about it and stuff and be virtuous or something, but just that there's not a hero.
*  It's more complicated.
*  Yeah. I think, unless you're, you've been living with Amber and Johnny, you don't know.
*  Just cause one seems more charismatic in the moment or funnier or more believable even,
*  doesn't mean that their truth is the truth.
*  And I feel like there's still love there too, which makes-
*  Oh, that's the hardest part. He won't even look at her. He looks down the whole time
*  and maybe people say, well, it's cause anger or, or hurt or whatever, but I, the way that she looks
*  and stuff, it feels, it just feels like there's so much hurt there that it hurts. It hurts me to
*  watch it. I just feel like, Oh, my heart just like aches for them and, and for both of them. And I
*  don't know either of them personally. And, and, you know, I don't know, just hurts.
*  But it's, I've never, I've never seen sort of love laid out in this rock kind of way. It makes me
*  feel better about like, it almost gives you seeing people who have gone through a struggle
*  in this sort of mundane kind of way gives you room to struggle yourself about the messiness of love.
*  So true. Like you're supposed to, like relationship is supposed to be simple and whatever,
*  but this like, Oh man, this- It's like art.
*  Yeah. And, and for the record, like, I don't feel like it shouldn't be shown. Like I don't
*  like, I think it's actually really beautiful art. And I agree. There's going to be a lot of people
*  who walk away from it and are changed in certain ways or look at things different. I'm not saying
*  it's changed in the whole world, the Johnny Depp trial, but it's art. It's just like,
*  you would look at a painting and it might affect you. My only commentary is more that there's not,
*  I think it's silly when people say who's right and who's wrong and who's the clear villain and
*  who's the like, we love as humans. We have to have an answer for everything. We have to put
*  everything in a box. And it's like, well, we're looking at this and we're deciding
*  you're right and you're wrong. And I just think it's silly unless it's your life.
*  So speaking of heroes and villains and highs and lows, you grew up in Las Vegas and you said that
*  Vegas is a performing town, a town of high stakes drama and eccentricity. It's a town of high highs
*  and low lows. And I'll be damned if my therapist didn't point out that correlation out to me
*  personally a long time ago. So to me, Vegas from the outside is romanticized by certain movies.
*  The lows define the beauty of this town and certain movies. So to me, Casino
*  was Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone. Leaving Las Vegas with Nicolas Cage,
*  if you're unloading Las Vegas with the Chinese template,
*  Hunter Thompson. First of all, what's your favorite representation of Vegas from a darker
*  side? And do you draw any wisdom insight from the darkness, the lows and the highs
*  from in those movies or is it over romanticized? So I grew up in a really conservative Mormon family.
*  Vegas was established by the Mormons and the mob. Those were the two very different worlds that
*  created what Vegas is. And if you live in Vegas, it really shows in a lot of ways because Vegas has
*  the strip and the parties and the craziness, but it also has very neighborhoods and big families and
*  conservative people and liberal people living together in a really interesting way.
*  And for me, growing up here, for instance, was a lot of like driving on the freeway,
*  my mom being like, children, close your eyes. There's a naked woman on that billboard and
*  okay, mom, on our way to church. You know what I mean? It was like, but also being like, whoa,
*  this is crazy. You know what I mean? Like taking in whatever I could when I could.
*  So I saw and I'm grateful for that. Like I really love that I didn't grow up as a Mormon. And for
*  instance, like Utah or something like the typical place because I saw both sides and I appreciated
*  something from both sides. And now as a person now who's not religious, but just spiritually minded,
*  you know, I'm grateful for that divergent character, that juxtaposition, dual edged
*  sword that Vegas is. And I try to apply that to everything in life, which is like Johnny Depp
*  and Amber. It's like there's two sides to every story. There's always two sides to every coin.
*  There's always, and there's something to be said for both. Like I try to see people and
*  even if, you know, it's just, yeah, I try to apply that to life. As far as a movie that
*  personifies Vegas or something in that medium that personifies Vegas in a way that resonates with me.
*  Don't say hangover.
*  No, no. Yeah. I also like, I wasn't even allowed to watch PG-13 movies growing up. So I, a lot of
*  the movies that you're saying, like I, I didn't, I either didn't see, I didn't have cable television,
*  you know, I wasn't like a pilgrim, but I had a really, really conservative upbringing.
*  So it didn't define your intellectual like development.
*  No, no, I just, I can't think of any movie that comes to mind where I'm like,
*  that's my Vegas movie. You know what I mean? Like I'm sure I've seen some of the movies you've said
*  now, but I don't, I can't think of one that I'm like, actually personifies Vegas in a way
*  that feels honest to me. Like, or, or, or like, wasn't there a Chevy Chase? Was there a Chevy Chase?
*  Yeah. Yeah. I think that's maybe the only one I thought of that came to mind where I was like,
*  cause I love Chevy Chase so much that maybe it's one of his Vegas, Vegas vacation or something.
*  Yeah. So, but that's more like lighthearted, that kind of stuff.
*  Right. It's not like, I guess what I would say is there's no truth that has been,
*  that I've seen of Vegas. Cause what I see of Vegas is, there's obviously like the parties and stuff
*  and the nightlife, which I'm not a big party person. So I haven't really experienced much of that,
*  but I've also, there's also drugs and I've, I have a strange relationship with drugs. I've lost a
*  few friends to drug overdoses. And so I don't, that's not romantic to me, but there's also like,
*  um, yeah, I mean, you asked for a dark reflection of it. I could, I guess I certainly see a dark
*  reflection to Vegas and I don't, I feel like Vegas is typically personified as like at the tables and
*  everything. But it's also like, I have like friends who've lost all their money to gambling
*  addiction. And so it's like, what I guess, uh, somebody maybe needs to make, maybe that's an
*  open spot. There needs to be a dark side to Vegas. It's about Mormons in Vegas, dying to drug overdose.
*  Or getting shot by the mob. Yeah. Uh, so you mentioned your spirituality. You've, um,
*  you said that having a crisis of faith or just the philosophical question of asking who is God,
*  does God exist or in thinking of the flip side of that of mortality, what happens when we die,
*  those kinds of things were extremely difficult, uh, deep, um, things for you, uh, in terms of
*  your development, the whole process of figuring that out. Um, why does it hurt so much to lose
*  faith in God? Yeah, I would say that the seeking of God, let's say that is an obsession for me
*  and has been since I was young. I really feel that I'm a deep, deep, deeply like committed
*  to finding answers in life. And there's some answers that I don't think there's an answer to.
*  And I'm also very OCD by nature. So I just don't give up to that. I'm like, well, there must be
*  somewhere in Tibet. There's some teacher or there's, there's somebody out there that has the answer,
*  or maybe it's yet to be found. I'm going to find it. Um, I'm really, my life has been to date
*  probably unhealthily committed to finding answers about God or the lack thereof
*  and, um, mortality. It's all I think about. It's all our records have been about.
*  Who do you think is God? Have you ever gotten a glimpse?
*  You know, I will say the closest I feel like I have been to experiencing God is, uh, and this sounds so,
*  maybe, I don't know. I don't know how it sounds, but it's through ayahuasca for me. That's, that's
*  my honest answer for you. I feel like I had pretty much given up all hope of there being anything
*  greater than, you know, us being, you know, evolving and being here and then dying and
*  you're gone and that's it and nothingness and from nothingness we came and nothingness we go.
*  To where I am now, which is there are answers to be found. I don't know them. Like, I don't know
*  what God looks like or if God is anything to do with the word God in the way that we say it,
*  but I do believe pretty fervently that there is more to be found. Is it motion sensor or no?
*  I don't know what that was. It looked like they have all died actually.
*  Do you know which one of it? Is it this one right here? Why don't I just take it out?
*  Take it out.
*  Do you want to hold this chair?
*  See if I can get it like this. Yeah.
*  Almost there. I really don't know.
*  There's got to be like something about this. There we go. Chinese proverb.
*  How many people does it take to, what is it on school? A light bulb?
*  It was hot too. I was doing the two finger technique.
*  I'm glad you survived that. Thanks.
*  That'd be pretty ironic if we're talking about mortality and then this would be it for you.
*  I've never done ayahuasca. It's a mixture of two plants. One of them is DMT,
*  but a lot of people I really respect, very, very intelligent people,
*  had profound experiences with ayahuasca. What is that? Where do you go? Where does the mind go?
*  What the heck is up with that?
*  I'll first say that I can't even smoke weed. I really do not enjoy it because I hate to let go
*  of control. If I feel out of control in life, it's one of my biggest weaknesses. It's very scary
*  for me. Some people really enjoy letting go in that way. I really don't.
*  I was pretty terrified to make the jump then to ayahuasca, but my wife, who I deeply respect,
*  made a profound change through ayahuasca. I saw it.
*  She led the way.
*  Yeah. It wasn't a strange... We have a thing in America that's a misconception, a stigma on
*  psychedelics where it's a drug and it makes some people crazy. Then you're going to be on the
*  street and you're going to be out of your mind or you're going to become a crazy person, basically.
*  I think I really bought into that notion because, again, I wasn't even raised with cable TV. You
*  know what I mean? Ayahuasca is very... You can imagine what that was like for a Mormon kid. I
*  didn't know anything about it and never touched drugs at all and never even touched a cigarette.
*  Anyway, I think we have this misconception about it where Americans are quick to go to their doctor
*  and take any medication or drug, but whoa when it comes to psychedelics.
*  Anyway, that being said, I had that trepidation going into it, but I really love and respect my
*  wife and I saw it make a profound impact in her life where she suddenly was able to
*  heal from a lot of trauma that she had. She went through a lot in her life.
*  It really helped her heal, but it also set her in a new path spiritually that seemed really
*  like a place that I wanted to be. I did it and I did it twice. The first time it didn't really
*  have an effect on me, which happens to a lot of people, I guess. I drank this little thing and
*  there was this shaman who came over from overseas that had been in the plant world for
*  decades and was a really incredible, I don't even know if he likes to be called shaman, but...
*  So it's supposed to be like 30, 60 minutes to take effect and a few hours. The journey lasts...
*  About four hours.
*  Four hours.
*  Yeah, so the second time I took it, I took it in I would say 20, 30 minutes. Exactly. I started to
*  feel like I was like the dimension of what is reality. The curtain was pulled open and there
*  was a lot more to discover. It really blew my mind in a way that I think it would probably blow
*  anybody's mind if, for instance, God descended or some Christian God or whatever it is. We all think
*  it'd be this beautiful thing, but in reality, it would probably make people super fearful and
*  think that they've lost their mind. I've always joked that if the Mormon God came down and told
*  my mom, if God himself came down and told my mom, Mormonism is incorrect, she would say,
*  Satan. I think our minds are just not prepared for a lot of anything that's really extreme.
*  It was very extreme. It was like the curtain of life was cut open, which scared me, but then I
*  felt very much... And a lot of people that I've talked to have a similar thing where I felt very
*  much like I was either communicating with something that was perceived as God to me or highest sense
*  of self or mind or Mother Earth or it's called so many different names, but it's really... A lot of
*  people have a very spiritual similar experience with ayahuasca. Just in that it's this kind of
*  profoundness. It wasn't like... There was nothing, at least for me, that felt like psychedelic,
*  funny cartoons or something. It was like, I'm about to go on a journey and I'm communicating
*  with something that feels incredibly wise. It showed me a lot of things in my life,
*  kind of almost like from a bird's eye, almost like I was looking through a video camera,
*  a younger me. There was a particular thing that it communicated to me.
*  I really have a hard time with accepting success and not feeling
*  undeserving or something. I can't quite put it into words, but of my position and what I've been
*  given, I've been given so much. It showed me this thing from when I was young and explained to me
*  why I am where I am now. To this day, it did not feel like myself telling myself that. That's the
*  only way I can explain it. There was a lot more that it showed me and that was incredibly healing
*  for me. But just to put it into a short thing, because there's so much to this,
*  I walked away feeling very convinced that there is more to be known, for sure, and a lot of my
*  deep things that were traumatic for me didn't feel traumatic anymore, specifically crisis of faith.
*  I was very angry at my parents and my community for raising me in what I perceived to be falsehoods.
*  I felt like the bedrock of everything I believed was ripped out for me in my 20s. Then it was like,
*  good luck in life. But really, my parents had given me everything that they could. They believe that
*  very much so, still. But a naive young me was angry and felt like they had been duped, and thus
*  I had been duped. But ayahuasca really showed me this roadmap of like, this is truth and you're
*  concerning yourself about a grain of sand, which is Mormonism or whatever it is. There may be some
*  truths in that tiny grain of sand and there may be falsities, but so is all these other grains of
*  sand. Focus on the truth. Stop focusing on these little details that are meaningless and forgive
*  and let go of people believing in those things to begin with. I don't know if that makes sense, but
*  that was the core thing I was taught, and to let go of control. Stop needing to control everything.
*  Lennon And it felt like the wisdom was coming from elsewhere.
*  David It's really, I do not believe, at least in my current self, I don't have that,
*  the mindfulness that I believe that exists in me to reach a lot of the conclusions that I did. And
*  there was a lot more to it that would be for like a late night conversation with you, but
*  it's so hard to put it into, you feel like a crazy person. At least, anytime I talk about ayahuasca
*  to someone who hasn't done it, I'm like, I don't even know where to begin. How do you explain to
*  someone that you felt like a multiple dimension type thing happened in a way that, putting it
*  into words, and none of it was words, by the way, that was communicated to me. It was like,
*  you know how people talk about telepathy, and if it existed, it would be like, I could communicate
*  to you in such a deeper way. I'm so confined by me having to articulate these words and put them in
*  a sentence to you, Lex, and then tell you, if only I could just be like, and emotions do that sometimes.
*  You could see my emotions and be like, oh, that communicates a lot. So that's what it felt like
*  to me with ayahuasca, it felt like it was communicating to me very clear things, but it
*  wasn't like, Daniel, it's me, Mother Earth, let me relax, sit back, let me show you. But it was very
*  clear to me what was being said, and no, it did not feel like me, but maybe smarter people than me
*  who've done it would say, well, it was you, and blah, blah, blah. I don't know, but it was very convincing.
*  There's a lot of stuff in that subconscious that we haven't explored, like we haven't explored the
*  depths of the ocean, we haven't really figured out what's that, the younging shadow, what's going on
*  underneath the surface of our conscious mind, and what is that connecting to? Is that just inside
*  our mind, or is it some kind of, is there some kind of collective intelligence going on where
*  all humans are connected to one kind of greater organism? Like, what is consciousness? We have a
*  lot of hubris in thinking we understand any of it, like how the mind works at all. Like, what is it,
*  like where, what is the origin of consciousness? What is the origin of intelligence? There's a
*  lot of hubris about this. We give each other PhDs and Nobel prizes and congratulate ourselves as
*  if we figured it all out, but humility is helpful here. Nevertheless, that is the question that
*  humans have been asking for ever since humans were humans, which is the question of mortality,
*  the question of God. So, whether it's Hamlet to be or not to be, I think that's the hardest,
*  the most important question. Albert Camus asked, why live? So, in terms of crisis of faith,
*  in terms of your search for truth, in terms of some of the dark places you've gone in your mind,
*  what's a good answer to this question? So, for Camus with mythic Sisyphus, it was
*  the question of suicide. What's the purpose? Like, what's a good answer to why keep going,
*  especially when you're struggling, especially when you're not,
*  when you're feeling hopeless, when you're feeling like a burden in this search for truth,
*  where you feel like you're surrounded by lies, what's a good answer to why live?
*  You ever find one? Well, the simple answer right now is to say, it's very easy once you have kids
*  to say, the right answer is you just, of course, you brought these kids into the world. So,
*  you have a responsibility that I feel deeply as a father to them to always be there for as long as
*  I humanly can and to take care of them and protect them. It's the most innate sense in me. It's
*  wired in my animal existence. So, if I take that away, because that's kind of cheating.
*  Let's put that aside because it is cheating.
*  It's cheating.
*  There's still some fundamental way in which you're allowed to live.
*  There's still some fundamental way in which you're alone.
*  Yeah. And to that, that actually has been a real struggle for me for many years. I had a real
*  turning point early in my career where we were flying somewhere overseas and we were in a really
*  small plane and the lights went out and all these red lights were flashing and the plane just started
*  to dive. Completely scariest plane experience I've ever been in. My manager was next to me,
*  who's my brother. He was crying and texting his wife a goodbye. That's how crazy this moment was.
*  Was it real, like genuine?
*  Genuine, like genuine engine went out, plane is going down, pilots looking crazy in the front,
*  and it was a really tiny jet. Like I said, my brother next to me crying,
*  typing a text to his wife. Really, really scary. I felt nothing. I genuinely sat there and I was
*  like, this might actually be nice. I really felt like this goes down and like, man, life sucks and
*  hard. And that sounds so ridiculous, I know to say, because again, I'm in a different place now
*  and I see my life for what it is, but at that moment I did not.
*  So life was primarily defined by suffering. It was a burden.
*  It was. I felt I was incredibly depressed. I had been trying different medications since I was
*  young and I just had not found anything that was working for me. And then I was in a faith crisis,
*  lost all my faith, started a band that just became, I wasn't ever thinking that this band,
*  I was like, when you call your band Imagine Dragons, you're not thinking that band's gonna
*  be big, okay? This was like a side project that was fun for me. It was like art in college. I was
*  at in school and I was like, man, I hate this biology class. I'm gonna write down band names.
*  You know what I mean? It was not, hey, put everything aside. This is my career. Let's go.
*  It happened. And I'm an introvert by nature. I'm really not an extroverted person who likes to go
*  out and I like to be at home with a couple friends and have a late night conversation over good food.
*  That to me is a perfect night. Read a good book, listen to a podcast, go on a walk.
*  You know, those are things that I really, really enjoy. And suddenly I'm in this life where I'm
*  like supposed to be something that I really don't wanna be. Except for on stage, which is a really
*  fast and like strange thing to me, which is on stage, I feel so free and exuberant and like
*  an extrovert. And then I come off and I just feel like shrivel back into a show. Like it's a, it's,
*  music does that for me and performing on a stage does that for me.
*  Can we take a small tangent on that?
*  Yeah, yeah, of course.
*  What's the high, can we go through that, the introvert that wants to cuddle up and read a
*  book? You're the front man of one of the, if not the biggest rock bands today, playing in front of
*  huge crowds. What's the high of that and how can you land back on earth?
*  The high of it, it's incredibly beautiful to walk on a stage, sing these songs that you wrote
*  and see it resonate with people around you and sing with them. Different cultures, different
*  places celebrate life. It's suddenly, the world seems like a fantastic place. It feels like
*  we're all on the same team. It's like one big hug.
*  Yeah, it's like everybody in that room gets it and they all, it just, it feels like what you want
*  the world to be, which is just like this coexisting unit of people. And it's not even about,
*  like, you know, I just, it's incredible. It's for sure, it's incredible. And I love it and I
*  wouldn't do it unless I loved it. And then you walk off stage and you turn on the news and it's
*  like, you see, you know, we're all against each other. Everybody hates each other. And it feels
*  that way in the world. So music really, that's why live music is so important to people. That's why
*  music is so important to people. Because even if it's just you and that person that wrote the song,
*  you're listening to it and the two of you feel connected, you know, it's like you're hearing
*  Tracy Chapman sing like Fast Car or something. You're just like, oh my gosh, like, yes, I get it.
*  And you feel connected to that person, you don't feel alone. So that's the high of it, for sure.
*  And then you get off stage and then, you know, as my, like my uncle's a heart surgeon, incredible
*  heart surgeon who like writes the book. Like he's like the guy that the heart surgeons talk to. He's
*  out of Nashville, Tennessee. He's just an incredible genius man. He always worries and always reached
*  out to me. He's like, musicians die all the time. And the reason they die, you know, is because
*  you're getting on stage and your heart's doing this and your cortisone levels are doing this.
*  You're getting off stage and then you're just doing this. And it's a really real thing. Like
*  you get off stage and you feel like you need drugs because you're like, I, the world feels like,
*  oh, incredibly daunting. And it's also, I'm sure it has to do with like some, some like health
*  things in your heart and the cortisone levels that are so crazy. And then you come off and it's like,
*  I know people are like, well then nothing's enough except meth. You know, like that is enough
*  except heroin. And that's why a lot of artists turn to that stuff. And I don't say it in a,
*  I don't say it in a preachy way. Like I've struggled with drug abuse in my life. And I really,
*  I understand why artists turn to it. But also the fact that you're an introvert.
*  You're an introvert. So the other side of it, the fame, that's something that you also said
*  is a double-edged sword for you. The interesting thing about fame is that you also mentioned,
*  is it something you can't take back? So it's a thing you can't just like go on vacation in
*  Hawaii and it's like, consider, do I like it or not? No, you're staying in Hawaii for the rest
*  of your life and you've never been there before, whether you like it or not. So what's that like
*  being, you know, loved by millions and millions and millions of people,
*  which is perhaps the best kind of fame in terms of if you have to choose the kinds of
*  fames there are and still being an introvert and all that kind of stuff. So what, do you feel alone,
*  more alone being famous? Is there a loneliness to it?
*  Yeah. I mean, it's such a funny thing. Okay. If you had asked, if we were having this conversation
*  a couple of years ago, I'd be incredibly guarded about this because the last thing I want to ever
*  do is sound ungrateful or unaware of how much I have and woe is the famous celebrity with money.
*  Oh, is your life hard? Is it really telling me about how hard it is? But I'm also a place in life
*  now where I just like, I'm going to always just speak my truth because that's the only reason I'm
*  here is I'm here to speak my truth to you. So I'm going to tell you my truth, whether it's whatever
*  it is. But you're human and feelings are real. And so, and that's the interesting thing. You
*  win a lottery. What's that going to feel like? It's not about complaining. Oh, it's so hard to
*  win a lottery because you get a lot of money. No, it's still, you're human. You get to experience
*  these feelings and it's fascinating. You put humans in different situations and it's also
*  fascinating because a lot of people think, well, I would like to be famous. That's a big thing now
*  on social media and Instagram and so on. The world wants to be famous. Or rich or famous.
*  And then it's very interesting to think, all right, well, once you arrive, are all the problems
*  solved? No, yeah. So I will tell you, according to me, what the pitfalls are, whether it's pure or
*  not. And there are certainly some pitfalls. One, it's once you're there, you can't go back.
*  Whatever. Maybe that's fine because maybe you love it. But the real pitfall for me is that
*  you're now, you're Lex and you're what everybody's perception is that Lex is. And that's what you are.
*  Now, Lex is probably a lot more complex and complicated and has a lot more to Lex than the
*  Lex that is the celebrity. But anybody who meets you, that's who you are to them. And you may not
*  feel this way, but you may feel confined to actually have to be that person to that person.
*  Early in my career for a long time, anytime I met someone, I suddenly felt like I had to
*  be Dan Reynolds from Imagine Dragons. Anytime I met someone, including my family now, who are also
*  like, whoa, this is crazy. You're like Dan Reynolds from Imagine Dragons. And I wanted to just be the
*  goofball that I have been my whole life with my brothers and family. But suddenly I found myself
*  feeling like, no, I have to be this. Because that's who this is. So you're almost like playing a role.
*  And it's like, I've heard a lot of actors talk about this, where they'll take on a role and then
*  they feel like they become that. And it's a really scary thing. You alter who you are almost
*  to fit the notion of other people. Because especially if a lot of artists are empaths,
*  a lot of people who get into art in a deep way are empaths. And so you feel a lot of what people
*  are feeling. And you're never wanting to burden people. And you're always wanting to deliver to
*  that person what they want. It's like people pleasing. It goes hand in hand with a lot of
*  these famous people. And they get to where they were because they know how to do that.
*  They know how to be in a room with someone and look them in the eye and make them feel like they're
*  the only person in the room. And then now they got that role in that movie because they sat with the
*  casting director and they were like, oh, you're so funny. Put on the charisma. Do it all. And it's
*  like, anyway, I'm going on a different tangent here. But long story short, there's a lot of
*  things that are really unhealthy about it. And then a lot of people who want the fame,
*  then the second it starts to go away, then they're like, who am I anymore? That was everything. And
*  now I'm on the down. And now I'm not a famous person anymore. And now I hate myself. Now I'm
*  going to do drugs. And it's like this vicious cycle. You could never be famous enough. You're
*  always going to get like, there's just so much to it that I've just, and again, like,
*  I've lost friends in this career to that for sure.
*  And there's a certain element to sort of just on the losing fame. I've interacted with a lot of
*  folks, especially young folks like on YouTube. Fame is a thing that has levels. You're always
*  trying to be a little more famous. A lot of folks who are chasing fame, it doesn't matter how famous
*  you are, you're always trying to chase more. And when you start to lose it, interesting things can
*  happen if you're not self-aware, which is like, like you mentioned, you might be trying to grasp
*  back at where you were by leaning into the formula that got you there. And so the constraints of the
*  image that you mentioned becomes the thing that you're now trying to lean into. And that's
*  actually walking away from who you really are. Like you lean further into being that person.
*  That's true for acting. That's true for even on like YouTube, which is people acting, they have
*  a role. They got them to the table somehow. Yeah, it's dark, but I think those are,
*  that's just put for everybody to see. But that's a very human struggle, even when you're not famous,
*  finding yourself, being yourself, of not letting, not doing the people pleasing at any scale,
*  and being trapped by that. Yeah, and also feeling like it's never enough. I think that's something
*  all, like it's not just a famous thing, but it's like in the whole, like everybody deals with feeling
*  like when I'm here, I'll be happy. When I get that job, I'll be happy. When I have that money,
*  then I'll be happy. When I get that surgery and my nose looks like this, I will be happy then.
*  It's like a constant chase of happiness instead of happiness. It's like the opposite, it's opposite
*  of self-love. It's the opposite of happiness. There's no presence to it. You're constant,
*  you're never going to find it. You're never going to arrive and you're just going to live your life
*  and then you're going to be on your deathbed and be like, I was chasing the wrong thing my whole
*  life. I should say that podcasts are interesting in that way. So for me personally, because you
*  just talk a lot, you can't, people that meet you, they know you and they know the evolution of you.
*  And that's the same thing for like you right now, Dan of Imagine Dragons, just being on a podcast,
*  long form reveals a side that liberates you more to be yourself. People see that, oh, there's a human.
*  Music, they have a deep connection with you. They have experiences with you the way they
*  experience it and that's who you are with them through the songs. But now you get to see, oh,
*  that's a human being. He probably gets angry, he gets sad, he's excited, he's hopeful.
*  And there's a core, there's a good human being, but the whole rollercoaster of emotions all there.
*  It's a giant beautiful mess and podcasts reveal that. That's why I love podcasts, like long form.
*  You get to hear some artists and actors and so on. And some of them you get to see, oh, you've
*  lost yourself in the surface. That's a tragedy with some actors, some great actors.
*  They've left so much of themselves in the roles they've played that they can no longer
*  be the thing they were before, those great roles. It's hard to see. You get to see that with Johnny
*  Depp with, I don't know, Pirates. He was talking about that with Pirates of the Caribbean. That was
*  a shift. Like he's not that guy. He's forever that guy. But the point is to
*  remember that you're not. And to your family, which is interesting you said with your family,
*  when I see people close to me, they also, there is an element like that while you're that,
*  they start treating you like the famous person. Yeah. I'm fortunate to have my manager, who's my
*  brother, my older brother, and my lawyer is my other older brother. And that's been helpful
*  because it's weird. It gets weird with everyone no matter what. One of the best advice I was given
*  was by Charlie Sheen. You got advice from Charlie Sheen? Yeah. We were playing- The wise sage of
*  our generation. Yeah. Wise sage Charlie Sheen. But it was. It was really wise. I was sitting next to
*  him and we were playing some late night television. And he said, this was right at the beginning. And
*  he just said, boys, just mark my words. Your life is about to get really weird. That's all I said.
*  But it stuck with me forever and it's Charlie Sheen. So of course it sticks with you.
*  And I remember being like, right, okay, Charlie Sheen. I'm not Charlie Sheen. It's not going to
*  get weird. But it got really, really weird, really quick because suddenly you've existed
*  your whole life in this way where everybody just, everything you get, you achieved, it was because
*  you got it. And every conversation you had, if someone liked you at the end of that conversation,
*  well, it's because they liked you. If they didn't like you, it's because they didn't like you.
*  And you can make complete peace with that. At least I could my whole life. I was like,
*  life is a challenge. And be myself and I'm going to go through it and find some people along the
*  way that I connect with and others know. And that social integrity is so important to us.
*  And we think it would be nice to have this. And this is going back to the pitfalls of fame.
*  We think it would be nice to walk into a room and have everyone be like,
*  and you could be like, dumpster fire. And everybody's like, oh my gosh, dumpster fire.
*  It was amazing. You said dumpster fire was amazing. It's incredibly, incredibly lonely.
*  And it just breaks everything that you knew about humaneness. And it sucks.
*  So then you're seeking out people that it doesn't exist with. And families are closest
*  you can get to that for sure. But even your family, it's going to take a little bit where
*  they're like, oh, this is a little weird. All my friends at work are now asking about you.
*  And you're my young, stupid brother. But now you're suddenly the young, stupid brother that
*  they want an autograph from and stuff. And it still makes, they have to get over that and figure that
*  out. And then you meet people too who know about this whole concept. And they're like,
*  I'm going to be an asshole to him to show him that I don't subscribe. And you're dealing with
*  people who are like, dumpster fire. And the person who's like, you could say something actually
*  profound and nice and they'd be like, that's stupid and you're an idiot. Because it's like
*  an actual attempt to show you how much they don't care. So you live in this very-
*  And still, nevertheless, even when nobody knew you, you were seeking for deep
*  human connection with a small number of people. And now when a lot of people know you,
*  you're still looking for deep connection with a small number of people. The struggle was the same.
*  Can you speak to, because you mentioned some of the dark moments, what advice did you give to
*  people who are struggling with depression? And maybe for the people who love
*  the people who are struggling with depression?
*  So what I have found to be most successful for me, it's back to the basics of everything that the
*  therapist or psychologist will tell you, psychiatrist will tell you right when you meet them,
*  which is exercise every day. Eat healthy, for sure. Find time, make time every day to do
*  something that you love, whatever that may be, whatever brings you joy. And when you're really
*  depressed, that actually feels like nothing. Because the things that brought you joy don't
*  bring you joy anymore, when I'm really in the thick of it. But for me, this is the cycle that
*  I'll go through is I'll look at my life and I'll say, okay, what can I clean up? All right, well,
*  for me, it was cutting out alcohol actually helped me a lot. I know that sounds like a big,
*  I'm not judging anybody for that. And I still drink on occasion, but I have felt alcohol has
*  been very unhelpful to my mental state. I feel less drive and less happiness the next day for
*  things that I want to do. I feel like it plays a lot with your serotonin.
*  So look for stuff to change.
*  Clean living, yeah. Clean living, but also understanding that sometimes it just is,
*  and you just keep breathing, and it will get better with time.
*  This too shall pass.
*  This too shall pass. I really think that in the winter, I'm pretty sure, I've seen a lot of
*  therapists and all of them say the same thing, which is like, you have major depressive disorder,
*  and this is what it is. But it's certainly worse for me in the winter months. So I know there's
*  like, I can't think of the term for it, but there's a term for like seasonal depression,
*  there it is. So I'll get to the winter and suddenly I'm like, geez, everything really
*  sucks on a deeper level. And then, so it's like this too shall pass is another thing. It's like,
*  just practice those things. Absolutely see a therapist. That's my biggest emphasis of life is
*  to like on stage, like my goal, like I have a few things that I really, really care about. One is
*  is mental health and destigmatizing therapy. Because for me, I didn't go to therapy for a
*  long time because I felt that it would be admitting that I was broken. It'd be admitting that I was
*  weaker than Lex, who doesn't have to go to a therapist because Lex is stronger. So be strong
*  like Lex. You know, I would like look at all my older brothers and I looked up to them so much,
*  and they were all these incredibly successful people. Plastic surgeon, anesthesiologist,
*  a dentist, two attorneys, Stanford, NYU, like just like incredible high standards,
*  Eagle Scouts, you know, like they valedictorians, like they just did it all. So for me,
*  I was very, really did not want to admit and none of them went to therapy. So it was like,
*  what are you going to be? Are you, oh, you're broken? Are you like the weak one who can't hack
*  life? And I think that's incredibly dangerous. And I feel like it almost cost me my life because
*  I took so long to finally go to therapy. So I really want kids to know, hey, like the great
*  people that achieve great things that are doing amazing things, they probably have help, almost
*  all of them. It's like going to the gym, but it's a mental gym. What, so I, unfortunate, I wanted to
*  be a psychiatrist when I was growing up. Maybe that's why I like podcasts. Maybe that's-
*  I think you'd be a good one.
*  Maybe I would.
*  I think you are a psychiatrist pretty much, right? Sounds like you're a psychiatrist.
*  I think I need more. I think actually to be a good psychiatrist, you also need to be
*  seeking therapy from the, like you also need to have some stuff to work through in your mind.
*  Right.
*  I think, yeah, you have to have gone to some dark places.
*  Empathize.
*  The empathy. It's the ability to empathize and especially if you've directly experienced that
*  you can go to those places in your mind. Like you said, it's with the music. To be authentic,
*  you have to really go there. Why did therapy help so much? What is the process of therapy,
*  if you can just educate a little more, is it, are you basically bringing to the surface and
*  talking through things that you, because of the momentum of life, you just never allow yourself
*  to speak through, to think through? Is that what therapy is or is there some more systematic thing?
*  So I've been to a lot of strange different kinds of therapy. So I'll tell you,
*  my first therapist- If I could interrupt, how hard is it to find a therapist that connected with you?
*  It's actually pretty hard, I think. I think for, well actually I have a skewed view of that because
*  going back to the beginning of my therapy was with a Mormon therapist. So it was very much like,
*  well, are you reading your Book of Mormon and are you praying at night? You know what I mean? Like
*  that was a big focus of my therapy to begin with. And you're having a faith crisis in the distance.
*  Yes. I was like, well, and then- You're making it worse.
*  Yes. The next therapist I went to was a Scientology therapist. I met my wife and she was Scientologist
*  at the time and she's not anymore. She's like, it's such a funny thing to look back on because we met,
*  I was like this Mormon missionary who had just got home from his mission and I met her and she's
*  Scientologist. I was like, wow, that's bad shit crazy. Like that stuff's crazy. And she's like,
*  what are you talking about? You're crazy. You're Mormon. That's bad shit crazy. And the two of us
*  were like, huh, maybe there's something to this, the both of us here. Yeah. The tension actually
*  forces you to think through like, oh, well, what is true? Yeah. And we really fell in love through
*  that, which was like, maybe we're both on the wrong track. Let's figure this out. But before
*  that happened, we went to a Scientologist therapist who that therapy consisted of,
*  what have you done wrong to Asia? And they would ask me that question over and over and over and
*  over until I'm like thinking of the deepest, darkest things that were in the recesses of my
*  mind. This was marriage therapy. Anyway, I'm not going to get into that, but it was Scientology
*  therapy. So that was a different thing. And then I went to therapy therapy, like no, not attached
*  to any religion. And that was a really great experience for me. And since then I've been
*  through a couple of different therapists, but that was more because where I was and moving and things
*  like that. So is it that hard to find a great therapist? Probably not, but maybe don't go to
*  your Mormon therapist first and then Scientology therapist. Or maybe that's the route for you.
*  Maybe it's the route for you. I don't know. Yeah. But what is, so is it bringing stuff to the surface,
*  basically? Oh yeah, so I didn't even answer your question. Why is it so effective? Is there something
*  you could put words to? Yeah, I mean, I think it's obviously there's the common things you would
*  think of, which is like, oh, I've been holding these things in and I don't want to tell anybody.
*  And then I tell this person and there's relief in that. But that's really not where the real work
*  comes from. I think the real work is meeting with someone who is well-versed and educated
*  and understands. It's like coding. It really is. It's like someone who like they listen to you and
*  they're like, well, that was a trigger. And then this became this trigger. And you're probably,
*  every time you're hearing that thinking of this thing that happened earlier in your life and they
*  just will walk you through scenarios. And maybe some of them aren't right, but some of them you'll
*  be like, it'll resonate sometimes you're like, wow, I am feeling that because of that. And that did
*  happen. And maybe if I call my mom and say this to her, it will make me feel better. Hey, mom,
*  this happened. It's like work. You put in work and you have hard conversations and do difficult
*  things. And so if your therapy is not difficult, I actually think that's not good therapy. Good
*  therapy is it's going to be a little difficult. It's work. During and after. Yes. I had this
*  incredible therapist who I told him when I was going to do ayahuasca, he was like, Jesus,
*  he actually was a doctor before and a really well-educated, studied person who had walked
*  away from brain doctor. What's the word for that? Brain doctor. Brain surgeon. Neurologist.
*  Oh yeah, neurologist. And he said, well, basically his belief was that ayahuasca was like
*  basically doing therapy, like 50 sessions. It's like really intensive. He's like,
*  I don't know if you want to do that. If you do, you can make some big steps forward. But
*  I prefer just to do one session at a time. And so yeah, it's hard work. And I typically like,
*  it's really hard for me to even talk about ayahuasca by the way, going back to that,
*  because I'm not looking to tell everybody to go do ayahuasca. It's incredibly hard.
*  It was the scariest experience of my entire life. It felt like I went to heaven, but it also felt
*  like I went to the darkest, deepest hell that was incredibly scary. Incredibly scary. Yeah.
*  He told the story of how you wrote the song, Believer, or like
*  your childhood friend, I guess, Donald, like bullying and that kind of stuff.
*  This song, a lot of your songs are super interesting, sort of in terms of percussion,
*  super interesting, super interesting lyrically, just how it flows. And also,
*  pain is at the center of it. I mean, a lot of, like you said, the crisis of faith,
*  some of these existential questions are basically behind a lot of your songs, funny enough. Maybe
*  they're covered in metaphor, so it's hard to see, but it's there. And this song is really,
*  is really interesting in that way that it puts pain. You made me a Believer.
*  You break me down, you build me up, Believer. That's so interesting. Maybe can you tell the
*  story of how the song came to be? I'd love to listen to it too. I have some questions musically
*  about it too. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's exactly what we're talking about with therapy. I just feel like
*  the greatest things in my life have come from the deepest hurt. Losing someone that you love
*  is maybe the hardest part of the human path for me, at least thus far. When I think of,
*  okay, what was the hardest thing? There's like, you think of physical pain or maybe
*  going through financial pain or whatever. I think losing someone that you really love,
*  losing someone that you really love to death is one of the hardest. For me, I would say it was the
*  hardest, but it also makes you look at your life completely differently and alter your life,
*  at least for me, in ways that were really healthy. Being more present, letting go of things that were
*  meaningless, trying to control what other people think about you, wasting your time on things like
*  that. You suddenly see like, wow, time. I got a small amount of time. How do I want to spend it?
*  I'm going to spend it in the best way I know how and that's it. It's a basic concept that's
*  been said a million times over in a million different ways, but that's pretty much what I
*  was trying to say with Believer, which is I lost faith in everything at that time period,
*  and previous to that time period, and then I was rebuilding my faith or my spiritual thought
*  process. It was after ayahuasca and it was like finding, being a believer, and that's not necessarily
*  a believer in God or a believer in heaven and hell or anything like that, but a believer in more,
*  believing in goodness, believing in that there is some light. Again, those words,
*  they're just words and I wish there were better words to formulate the thought that I'm trying
*  to express, but just more. The thought of me dying, for me, I don't fear it. I don't fear it,
*  I don't fear it, but actually I really fear not seeing my kids again. I'll say that.
*  That is fearful for me. I feel like I love so deeply these children that the thought of leaving
*  them for me is a scary thought or something. They're kind of a good reminder how much you
*  love life actually and you don't always remember that. I think having kids is not for everyone,
*  absolutely for sure, but for me, and especially you shouldn't be having kids to give yourself
*  a reason to live. I feel like dying, I'm going to have a kid. You might feel more like dying
*  after having a kid actually. It's pretty stressful, but it is a place to like,
*  I've changed a lot of people that I've known that it gave them a new intensity of gratitude for life,
*  for sure. Guy, do you mind if we, I'll return to the pain of the believer.
*  Do you mind if we listen to a little bit of the songs?
*  Nope.
*  Did you write the music first or the words first?
*  The same time, which is very typical for me.
*  By the way, just the way it opens, the intensity of openings.
*  Do you ever think about what the first few seconds sound like? Is that something that,
*  like when you imagine a song, is it the opening you imagine?
*  No, it's kind of a, I never think opening, I never think final, I think soundscape of how I'm feeling
*  right now. So it could be the middle of the song for all I know when I'm doing that,
*  but my process for me is very much lyrics and melody and music really come at the same time.
*  By same time, I mean, as I'm expressing maybe, I'm feeling like,
*  it's not that simple, but it's like, I'll hear it, it's like, here's all the orchestra and you're
*  pressing all the buttons at once and melody and my voice is just one of those instruments.
*  It's just utilizing one instrument.
*  So you've seen the landscape, and that landscape includes melody, includes percussion,
*  lyrics a little bit, or lyrics.
*  I will be words to begin with, like a word here and there. I'll be like,
*  I'm like, what's a word that I'm thinking of when I'm feeling this soundscape? I always create
*  with no theme in mind. I'm never, for better or for worse, just my process is I'm sitting down
*  and I'm writing a journal entry. Simple as that. It's like, when you sit down and write a journal
*  entry, are you sitting down and you're like, Kev, I've had all these words here that I'm going to
*  put on the page and I'm going to order it in this way. And my theme for my journal entry today is
*  going to be this. Maybe some people do, but I don't. My journal entry is, I don't know what I'm
*  going to say. Oh, how was today? Well, man, today was this and feeling this. And now that I think
*  about that, I'm really angry about that. That hurt my feelings when this happened. You're like,
*  you're formulating it as you go and that's the joy of it. And for me, that's what music is.
*  So I'll sit down, not thinking, hey, I've been wanting to write a song that has a hard beat,
*  or I've been wanting to write a song that's anthemic, or I've been wanting to write a song
*  that's, it's like, how am I feeling right now? And it's joyful. Is the feeling joyful to you
*  or is it struggle? You just made it sound like it's joyful.
*  Close. Yeah, fulfilling is the word I was kind of looking for.
*  But there was a lot of artists talk about really strong, like you talk about writers.
*  Cathartic. That's the word I was looking for. It feels like having a good moment with a therapist
*  where you're like, okay, I'm expressing this thing that I just need to express. For whatever reason,
*  I need to express this. The majority of the songs I write for the record are never heard.
*  I write over 100 songs a year. I release 20 songs every three years. So I don't know,
*  what's that percent? 20 out of 300. Come on, Lex. It's less than 10%.
*  Anyway, so it's- And then getting together with the band
*  and getting them selected down is really what the process is. So you're really writing
*  a song per one to three days, maybe a song that you can't quite figure out the puzzle of
*  that's going to last a little longer. I finish every idea.
*  Yeah. You finish every idea. I do. I finish every idea.
*  So it's not just like laying completely unfinished. I could open my computer for you right now
*  and I would show you hundreds and hundreds of songs that you would listen to and think,
*  and think, that sounds like a song. It's like there's rhythm, there's melody,
*  there's multiple instruments, there's lyrics. It's the same thing as for coding for me,
*  which is music, which is I can't walk away until I've completed it.
*  But it's finished. Well, finished is-
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, but it sounds like a song. I certainly do a lot more with it after with
*  the band. We'll pull it all apart. But it's a song. It'll be like, you'll listen to it and say,
*  okay, that was a song. You understand what it is for sure.
*  Do you think, this is a painful question from a fan perspective, do you think there's genius
*  on your computer that you walked away from that you just didn't notice it?
*  Do you think there's truly great songs that you've written that you just
*  didn't notice how great they are?
*  I think greatness is something that I feel I'm, I don't feel like I've achieved greatness.
*  Genuine, I'm not saying that to you in a way of like humility.
*  It's like Michael Jordan type.
*  No, genuinely I feel like I am on a journey right now to find who I am. And I'm 34 and it's like,
*  I don't even, I haven't begun that journey. I feel like I'm just starting that.
*  But that being said, I certainly don't know the right answer to what songs are, you know,
*  beloved or good to the masses. Like imagine dragons is such a massive entity. It's like,
*  there have been, I will say this, there are a couple of times where I fought really hard
*  to decide on the single, really hard, or I always fight for what goes on the record.
*  Always. I always put the record together and that's the record that I wanted to be.
*  And me and the guys come up with that and it's nobody else has influence, no manager, no label.
*  The single, everybody wants to have a say in it. Your label wants to have a say in it.
*  Your manager wants to have a say in it. And I have fought really hard over that.
*  And I've been wrong before and I've been right before. But as far as songs that I haven't put
*  out, I mean. Because you can imagine so many songs, you think of so many Beatles songs
*  that are like some of their grades while my guitar gently weeps. I'm trying to imagine
*  weird sounding, not that interesting possibly songs.
*  The majority of what we put them, honestly, it may be our best stuff is that we don't put out,
*  for instance, because our band is such a complex question. I really don't know, actually. I don't
*  know. Maybe one day I'll die and people will look and be like, I hated Imagine Dragons, but now I
*  listen to that song. I really like that. I wish they would put that out. Or maybe they'll be like,
*  oh, it all sounds like shit. I don't really know. Sorry, it is a tragic thing. That's why I asked it.
*  Which is like, there could be some great, incredible things that will take you a long time to
*  rediscover, to realize how great they are. And it's also the tragic aspect of being an artist is you
*  don't know, if you get fame or all that kind of stuff, you don't know what's going to really move
*  people. Because ultimately what you want is to connect with people and you don't know what that's
*  going to be. To me, it's tragic just as a fan of yours to see, maybe I wonder if there's like
*  incredible stuff there. Just as it is tragic to see great artists throughout history who didn't
*  get recognition until they died. It's like, cause they basically held on. Franz Kafka was extremely
*  self-critical. A lot of these folks had an idea of what's good and not, and they were wrong.
*  They had genius. They weren't entirely wrong because they became sufficiently popular, but
*  it's interesting. I try to genuinely release the songs that move me the most.
*  I'll say that. You're your own audience.
*  Yeah. I try to put out the songs that make me feel the most. I feel that. That's my only gauge.
*  Because it's so subjective of what is good. Nobody knows the song the masses are going to like.
*  Nobody knows that formula. Nobody knows it. So for me, it's always what makes me feel something.
*  One of the main lessons Rick Rubin taught me when we worked with him on this record was he would say
*  he would, his main point that he would continually bring up,
*  because he's not the type of person to be like, that's a bad song or that's good. It's just not
*  who Rick Rubin is. It's more like, there's more nuance to it. He would say, I don't really believe
*  you on that song. That's what he would say. He would say, and I knew that was like, that song's
*  a no go. He would say, and I would genuinely, there was a time he said it and it was about a song that
*  I really felt it and meant it when I said it. But he didn't believe it when he heard it.
*  And that was enough for me. I was like, man, well, at the end of the day, I can believe it all I want.
*  But if the listener doesn't feel the honesty in it, just like we were talking about earlier,
*  I think the most important ingredient is, is this truth, perceived as truth to someone else. And if
*  it's not, the bullshit indicator goes, I don't care. Throw it away. I don't care about it.
*  You said that he made you go through line by line the lyrics.
*  Every single one. That was excruciating for me.
*  Why was that excruciating? Well, first of all, it's Rick Rubin.
*  So you're in the room with Rick Rubin, who's done a lot of the greatest of all time. And
*  so I had to first just put that aside and be like, okay, well, you've done a lot of my favorite
*  records, but still you're human and not everything you say is going to be right.
*  I'm a strongly opinionated person and so is Rick. And so when the two of us were sitting
*  in our room together, it was, you know. But the lyrics, which is interesting. So
*  it's not the entire composition, but just like, let's look at the lyrics. What do you mean here?
*  Yeah. Oh yeah. Because he would look over every... There was like,
*  and there were battles he won, battles that he didn't win. And maybe he was right. I don't know.
*  I mean, there was, for instance, I'll give you an example. There was a song on the record called
*  Number One. Rick will probably laugh when he hears this. Because this was a big one that we
*  kept going back and forth on. But this will give you a good insight of what it was like.
*  And there's a line in it that says, I don't know, the chorus is, I don't know what I'm meant to be.
*  I don't need no one to believe when it's all been said and done. I'm still my number one.
*  And he was like, ah, it just makes me cringe when I hear that. He's like, I just... Like,
*  do you have to be like, can it not be like, you're still my number one? I was like, no,
*  it's not about anybody else. It's about self-love. He's like, yeah, but like,
*  do you need to talk about self-love like that? And I was like, well, I feel like I need to.
*  It's like, oh, but is there something else we can say there? We just kept coming back to this song.
*  And I changed it. I tried changing it. What did I change it to? It was like,
*  it wasn't you're still my number one, because it just made no sense. It wasn't about
*  some love thing or like someone else. I changed it to something else. And it just,
*  it was the one thing that I was like, I'm really sorry, Rick. Like, I get it. And if it sounds
*  cringey to you, it's definitely sounding cringey to other people too. And that sucks. But I don't
*  know how else to say this in a way that I want to put that song out anymore. But there were other
*  songs for sure where Rick was like, that or this, that word feels a little trite. You already said
*  that once. Can you say it in a different way? It was really helpful. And then, yeah.
*  It's really interesting because you're trying to say something so simply and yet not make it cringe.
*  That's really hard. That's a strange art form because you want to say some of the greatest
*  love songs. We looked at the Without You song. I mean, the whole thing is cringey. If you just
*  read it on paper, like it's a court report or something, but yet it's not, especially one
*  song maybe. But no, there's something about, yeah, maybe- Song in a way you believe it.
*  When you believe it, but also written in a way that's singable in the way you believe it. So it's
*  like- Right. It rolls off. It just comes out in a way that just feels like silky and-
*  No word catches your mind as cringey. But then music, I think great speeches are like that too,
*  or just conveying, communicating ideas simply. That's the art form is to not be cringey. So
*  interesting. And then you- Because when you're raw and real, it might have first feel cringey.
*  The battle there, and that's where you see people fail. Just regular artists, I don't know,
*  at Open Mic. I got Open Mic, so I just listen to musicians. When they write songs, they fail that
*  test. They write simple stuff, but it's cringey. Why? I wonder what was that? What is that?
*  I'm telling you, Lex, I tried to explain this to my brother the other day.
*  Because it's the same thing with a live performance. If I'm not in my right headspace
*  and I walk on stage and I walk up and let's say I say something and I do this, because I'm like,
*  this is the move. I'm like, this is the move. The crowd doesn't care. In fact, the crowd's like,
*  that's cringey when you did this. But if I wasn't thinking about doing this and I went up there
*  and I said something and I really meant it and my body was like, I can't explain this to you.
*  So silly to say out loud, but people will resonate to it when it's real. And when it's acted,
*  you could do it the exact, the motion could look the same. Your eyes look the same,
*  but there's something about the energy that people know. They know if it's real or not.
*  Yeah, people, like you said, incredible bullshit detectors.
*  A hundred percent. I'll go on a stage and if I'm not in the right headspace to be real,
*  it won't be a good show. If I'm real, then it's a good show. It's as simple as that.
*  Let's go through the song.
*  Like I said, great opener. So you had this in your mind, this landscape?
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  The beat was first on this.
*  What about the first and the second and like first things first?
*  The first line I wrote was first things first. I don't know why it just was like,
*  and then I was like, oh, that principle of, you know.
*  Great line. Don't second thing second. Don't you tell me what you think that I could be.
*  I'm the one at the sail. I'm the master of my sea. I'm the master of my sea.
*  Such a good-
*  Dad had that in his office. He had this saying that was something about the sailor and being
*  the master of the sea that I always loved.
*  There you go. Simple statement. Zero cringing. It's so powerful. It's so simple.
*  I'm the master of my sea. This whole song is just trivial, but in terms of lyrically,
*  but extremely powerful and original and unique sounding, something about the words,
*  just even, you don't have to actually sing them. You just read them.
*  And then raw. I was broken from a young age. Tuck myself into the masses, writing my poems
*  for the few that look at me, took to me, shook at me, feeling me singing from the heartache,
*  from the pain, taking my message from the vein. I can't. Why am I reciting your words to you?
*  But the percussionist throughout it, and that was there in the beginning.
*  The percussion is almost in the lyrics. Yeah. And I'm a very percussive singer because I was
*  a drummer first before I... I think same with Dave Grohl, probably a similar thing, which is
*  I think in percussive sense a lot when I'm writing. And I also was... Before I could
*  play an instrument, I would beatbox. And I think Michael Jackson did this too, actually.
*  I've heard in the studio that he was very similar, but a lot of what I do is percussive
*  because my brain thinks percussively first.
*  A little more because it's so good. It's almost like a drum, like,
*  tika-dum-dum, tika-dum-dum, tika-dum-dum, tika-dum.
*  And then you lay words on that. Yeah. Yeah, this.
*  It's building. It's almost like drums.
*  It's all building to the chorus.
*  What about the word pain? When did that come to you? Pain, you made me a believer.
*  Yeah, just the idea of... I just wanted to... I really... One of the things that...
*  A lot of the songs that I like, I like divisiveness, for instance. Not always,
*  but there's times where I want someone to hear a song and I want them to either love it or hate it.
*  I really don't want them to be in the middle ground. A lot of the songs that...
*  A lot of my favorite songs are divisive songs. And so, for instance, with pain, I want you to
*  hear that in almost like... It's like, whoa. You know what I mean? It's something either somebody's
*  going to hear and they'll be like, man, I just don't want to hear that like that. Or it's like,
*  oh, I felt that so deeply when he said that in that way because it sounded like this.
*  And when you think of the word pain, it's like... That's a...
*  At least for me, when I hear that word, it carries a lot of weight. It carries a lot of weight. So,
*  I wanted to sing it with a lot of weight and to come into that chorus with like... It's a striking
*  moment. And I'm also a tenor singing as... Sorry, I'm a baritone singing as a tenor.
*  So, that's where that natural like, gruffness comes from is I'm singing out of my range really
*  up in my head voice and it carries a lot of weight with it because of the baritone.
*  Can I ask you a specific sort of the pause before the pain?
*  It's really interesting because it's like a double...
*  How much work does that take to get that right? That's incredible because it's like...
*  So, you're kind of seeing the beauty through that and then that whatever that sound is the...
*  Right, the bass being rolled off.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I actually... When I first was approaching the chorus, it was actually...
*  It came in on one. I'm not singing it right right now, but it did not wait. And it felt
*  like it didn't hit in the way that it was supposed to hit because you predict that. You're like,
*  you're waiting to... Right, it was like... So, I wanted to feel a little more striking. Again,
*  it's like that thing that makes you kind of do this a little bit. You're like, huh? But once you
*  hear it a few times, you're like, ah, ah, and you predict, you know what I mean? It's like,
*  I'd rather someone hear our song the first time and be confused by it,
*  so they play it the second time. And then they're like, oh, okay. You know what I mean? I really
*  don't want... I'd rather turn some people off along the way and then the people who come along
*  for you are going to feel more committed, I think. It's just an interesting... It feels gutsy to
*  insert silence. You know? Yeah, that's what makes it... It's like the greatest speakers of all time
*  are like, and I told you, you would know. You're like, oh. Yeah.
*  What is that? Yeah, that's so interesting to do that just at the right time. And then pain,
*  right? Man, it's a brilliant song. Did you know it was a good song when you wrote it?
*  Out of the thousands of songs you've written? You know, it's always the same thing for me,
*  which is like, if I want to listen to the song and I want to listen to it a lot of times,
*  then those are the songs we put out. And I only want to listen to the songs that make
*  me feel something. Whether or not it's... Our single that did the very worst of all our singles
*  was the song that I wanted to listen to the least, but it made the most sense as a single,
*  which was all the wrong reason to choose it, right? It was... I bet my life, it was the single off
*  our second album. And that song was originally written, it was just a guitar and a vocal,
*  and it was very just quiet and laid back. And we were like, well, let's try to dial it up,
*  let's try to produce it. And we overproduced that song. We self-produced it as a band and we
*  overproduced. And that song, I mean, it did good in terms of a song, but for us it did not do good
*  compared to our other songs. And I really looked back at that and learned a lesson from that. It's
*  like, if I don't want to listen to the song, that's a sign already. If you don't want to listen to
*  your own song, it's probably not a good song. You said your dad, elsewhere in today, just said
*  that your dad early on was a kind of the early Rick Rubin. So when you were starting out, he gave
*  you feedback, he listened. What did you learn about music, about life from your dad? My dad is a really
*  quiet farm, grew up on a farm, very humble. I think he starts every sentence by saying,
*  this is just my two cents, pretty much. He's like, take it or leave it. He's that kind of a sense,
*  there's humility in everything and it's real for him. It's not like false humility. I really feel
*  like when he's saying things, he really is like, maybe this isn't any worth to you, son. And he
*  means it. But here it is. And it's always gold. And I'm like, wow, dad, that's incredible.
*  So what in those early days, have you like, so you were like 12 or something like that,
*  like starting to write songs? I was 12. I wasn't showing my music to anyone. I started writing
*  when I was 12 and I probably wrote for at least, let's say six months or something. And I had
*  written probably, I don't know, like a lot of songs during that time. What was the topic, by the way?
*  Love, anger? It was all sad. No, the first song I ever wrote went,
*  da da da da da da da da da da da. And it was like a bluesy thing. It was like, there was my voice
*  doing that. And then it was like,
*  oh,
*  you know what it is. But I was like a 12 year old with, I just felt like depressed for the first
*  time. And I just was like, so... I think you discovered the blues as a 12 year old.
*  Yeah, right. It really was. It was like my sense of the blues at that time, for sure. Like bad
*  version of the blues, but it was like 12 year old kid with a bunch of acne. I hated going to school.
*  I felt like I just had not found myself. Sounds like a great song,
*  by the way. I wanted to keep listening. I forgot I was...
*  I don't know about that. But yeah.
*  Yeah. What was your dad, at which point did you begin to share it with your dad?
*  A lot of the songs that I wrote in the beginning were very much like Bobby McFerrin like that,
*  because our mic was in a part of the house where I couldn't bring over the piano and only the
*  instrument I played at the time was the piano. So I would do everything with my voice. But then
*  I started teaching myself the guitar in that beginning like six month period, just watching
*  my brothers play in their garage bands in the basement. And then I started to write songs a
*  little more like Enya vibes, like stack my voice like 20, 30 times. And like Enya meets like Jarré,
*  which is who my dad would listen to a lot, John Michael Jarré. He's an incredible synth genius.
*  But anyway, so I finally got my gall up enough to show it to my dad one day after work. And I got
*  very little of my dad because there were nine kids and he worked from 8 a.m. till 6 p.m. We'll come
*  home very tired and here's nine kids that are like, Dad, you know, and you're the young one,
*  you're not you're just going to miss I was in the middle kind of too. So it's even you know,
*  middle child thing. But I sat him down. I was like, Hey, dad, I just want to like,
*  kind of show you a song. And he was like, Oh, you know, he didn't know I was writing anything.
*  I showed it to him and he listened. And he took it off. And he really looked at me. It was like,
*  that was really good. He was like, I really thought and this when you said this made me feel this.
*  And that did it. I probably would have given up music. Like I look back, that was a very
*  pivotal moment for me. I was like, in a place where I was like, is this good or bad? I don't
*  know. Maybe it's so embarrassing and terrible. And I was already writing lyrics that were a little
*  like overly metaphorical to hide that I was dealing with faith crisis because I thought,
*  okay, I'm going to show this to dad. I don't want my dad to know I'm like questioning the
*  truthfulness of Joseph Smith. I'm not going to be like, is Joseph Smith a real prophet?
*  It's Mormonism true. I don't really know. Like, you know, I was like writing way overly
*  metaphorical, but because my dad really validated it and he was a no bullshit person. So I knew when
*  my dad said that I was like, you know what, at least my dad really actually thinks this is cool.
*  And I really trusted my dad's taste and thought everything he listened to was cool. So I was like,
*  wow, I'm gonna keep doing this. And I just showed it to my dad for years and years. And still to
*  this day, I send every song to my dad. So he underneath it with the feedback is always like,
*  ooh, I like this idea. Like this is a positive, like a not always positive,
*  no, but like underneath it. Do you sense the positivity? Because I think always never,
*  never mean, never malicious. You know, there's like, there's two types of criticism. There's
*  like criticism. That's just like, you're looking to be hurtful to someone. And then there's
*  criticism. That's like, really important for art. It's the type of criticism that's like,
*  you see the value in what's happening. And if it's honest, then you can, you maybe communicate
*  with that person. Like, I see what you're trying to do with that. It's not like you have to say
*  that or whatever, like butter it up. But it's like, my dad would just give me this honest criticism
*  that would be like, you know, it certainly wasn't always good, but I knew it was always
*  well-intentioned. I guess that's how I would say it. So you mentioned, made me re-listen to,
*  I'm a big fan of Cass Stevens. You made me re-listen to father and son. I probably, all sons have
*  issues to work through with their fathers. And you said that you connect with this song in particular.
*  I think, so you're a father now. What is it about the song that connects with you? For people,
*  let me play it. Let me play a little bit. People should educate themselves on Cass Stevens.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  Right on the peace train.
*  The best. The best piece. Right on the peace train.
*  You think this is a hopeful, a sad song?
*  I hear it as hopeful. I hear it as a loving father saying just what his son needs to hear.
*  It's like that calm wisdom.
*  Yeah.
*  This time.
*  It wise.
*  And just the way he says that, that should be a corny line, but it's not corny at all.
*  It's like.
*  Yeah.
*  Look at me, I'm old, but I'm happy.
*  Yeah. I mean, the simplicity there. But it's such a contrast with, what's his name? Harry Chappin
*  Cats in the Cradle, which is like the sadness of, so this feels like there's a
*  wise, calm connection between father and son, right? With Cats in the Cradle. I don't know
*  if you remember that song. He learned to walk while I was away and he was talking before I knew it.
*  And as he grew, he'd say, I'm going to be like you, dad. I'm going to be like you.
*  And the idea of that song is that he does become like his dad, which is funny, something you said.
*  But in a different way, you become too busy to make that connection. His dad was too busy
*  to make a connection with his son. In a non-dramatic way, in a very kind of calm,
*  natural way. You just don't have time. You're busy at work, you're providing for the family,
*  and so on. There's connection, but you don't really get formed that depth of connection.
*  And then the father, when the son shows up from college and all that kind of stuff,
*  he doesn't spend any time with the father. And there's just the calm sadness of that,
*  that we can live parallel lives and never quite connect.
*  And there is a little bit of that in father and son with Kat Stevens too. When the son is saying,
*  from the moment that I could talk, I was ordered to listen. I always remember listening to that
*  line, feeling like that really moved me. But the beauty of that song is it shows, it's kind of like
*  the theme of what I feel like we've talked about since the second you got here, which is something
*  I really like. I don't know why it's such an important theme in my life right now, but
*  the duality of just understanding that you don't understand someone else's situation.
*  And there's truth to both sides. There's truth to what the father is saying to the son. He's
*  saying these things and he's like, I'm looking out for you. I love you. Take your time with these
*  things. If you want to get married, you can. These things will bring you happiness. And then the son
*  saying, listen, I want to pave my own path. I want to do this. Why are you telling me this?
*  Like, the son's not wrong because there's a lot of parents who tell their kids what to do and
*  they're wrong. You know what I mean? And they don't let the kid form the path that they need to.
*  But should you not be a parent? There's just two sides to everything.
*  Yeah, there's a thing. It is annoying when you're older, you get to see people do all the same
*  things. You could say, well, this is a phase and you'll see that this actually will end up in this
*  way. You can predict how life unrolls. And it's very annoying for young people to hear, especially
*  because it's probably going to be true. It's like, no, it's not going to be like this. No,
*  I'm going to be different. But then you become that person. But that doesn't mean they also
*  let them live that life, let them make the mistakes. But they're not mistakes, actually.
*  They're like beautiful deviations from the path that they end up on. And those make the path.
*  Do you have advice for young folks today? You've had like an incredible
*  dark journey and a successful one, a loving one, and one of the most successful
*  artists in the world. Is there advice you can give to young people today
*  that would like to find themselves through that way, especially if they're struggling?
*  I thought you said device at first. And I was like, honestly, I feel like that device is not helping.
*  Maybe everybody should throw away their devices. Advice.
*  Advice. I would just say what I emphasize to my kids is
*  I really, really want my kids to just learn to love themselves. It's easier said than done.
*  It's really easy to pick on yourself in life. It's really easy to look in the mirror and wish
*  you looked different, wish you were more successful like that person over there, wish that
*  you know, wish a lot of things. And people that I see that really succeed at life
*  really succeed truly. And that doesn't mean they're making money necessarily or they're
*  succeeding and you know, they're talking to a lot of people like their success. Success to me is like
*  happy. And they have real self-love. You meet, you know, when you meet someone, you meet Rick,
*  for instance, you meet Rick Rubin. Rick has a calmness about him. And it's funny because
*  everybody sees him as this like Zen master. Like Rick is just a really loving person who also loves
*  himself and has self-confidence because you just see it and it resonates. And that's why he draws
*  people. And that's why he's so great in the studio because you know his intentions always.
*  As an artist, when a producer comes in, you're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are your intentions?
*  What are you trying to do? Are you trying to get a hit out of me for the label? Are you trying to
*  make me something? Are you trying to like make me this so you can prove this about yourself? Like
*  there's a lot in that dynamic. And the reason that Rick is so good is because you know his intentions
*  and his intentions come because Rick has that self-love. So for me,
*  find the things about yourself because they're there that you love and really focus in on them.
*  And it's not selfish. Like I feel like I was brought up in a family too where it was like
*  never look inward, like be selfless, like serve, serve, serve, which by the way is a true principle
*  of life. I think you love yourself more when you serve more. I think that's really evident in life.
*  But also spend time doing the things that make you happy. Take time every day to go on that walk that
*  you need to go on. Listen to that book tape that you need to listen to. Like for me, that's something
*  I need. I know if I do that, I'm going to be a better dad because I did, I gave myself some
*  love back in life. And just forgive yourself, I think. Forgive yourself because everybody messes
*  up. Everybody hurts others. Everybody says unkind words at times. Everybody fails all the time. And
*  if you think that you're going to not, you're wrong and you're eventually going to and you're either
*  going to punish yourself for it every day and be a lesser version of what you could be
*  or you're going to forgive yourself for it. And if you learned that that's not something you want,
*  then try not to do it again. If you do it again and you're probably going to do it again, whatever
*  that is, you're going to gossip about that person. You're going to feel bad because then you gossiped
*  about someone. Is there something you could say in terms of self-love? Is there a role for being
*  critical? And you're like that, that those demons of like self-criticism, do you need a little bit
*  of that? Tom Waits talks about, I like my Tom, a little drop of poison. You need a little poison?
*  Or is that silly or a mental situation? No, I mean, look, my biggest thing in life that
*  has been like the thing that I've worked on the hardest for the last few years is to not be overly
*  critical and to let go of control. I think it's really easy to kill an artist. It's really easy
*  to kill an artist. Like if my dad would have sat down with me that day and even if he would have
*  just sat down and been like, good job, son, okay. It's not silly, right? Like I don't, I didn't,
*  not everybody has a dad who's going to ever do something or put in the time or whatever.
*  But that might have altered everything for me. Like my dad taking the extra time to just give
*  me a thoughtful response opposed to kids know. Kids know when you're just like trying to get out
*  of the room or whatever. I knew he wasn't and that did a lot. So yeah. But is that a huge,
*  isn't that what makes the artists? It's the fragility of it that like, would you have any
*  other way? No, no, I agree with you. I think that that's what that, that's the beauty of art.
*  But I think also on the same token, it's like, I went to, I went to music cares recently, which
*  is a charity for musicians that are down on their luck that maybe were successful at one point or
*  have never been successful and they can't pay the bills and this charity contributes money to these
*  artists, aspiring artists or artists who've had drug issues. And like there's a lot that they do,
*  but, and there was a statistic that they told it was staggering to me, which is I think it was 75%
*  of artists, musicians say they struggle with severe depression. That's really high. I don't
*  know what the national average is, but I would guess that that's higher than national average
*  per occupation. So I just think there's a tricky balance. There's a tricky balance in,
*  in art. So yeah, of course, like it's, it's a necessary thing, the fragility of it all, but.
*  Yeah. I wonder, cause I'm extremely self critical and I sometimes ask myself the question,
*  I've romanticized it or rather I've learned to be for it to be productive, to channel into
*  productivity. But I wonder if there's better ways to do that. And I also wonder if it's eventually
*  the thing that destroys me. Like if long-term, if it's a healthy thing, it might be useful when you're
*  sort of actively fighting the battles of the day, the, for me it's engineering challenges
*  and all that kind of stuff. But then when you're sitting back and enjoying life with family and
*  so on, is that going to be like, do you need to find that self love, like ability to kind of
*  silence the voice of criticism in your head? You know what? I really, there's a good,
*  you're making a good point. And I think that the middle ground is you need,
*  you need self doubt to push you to be better. I do believe that like, for instance, if I,
*  if I believed I've had my, like when you're like, these are a song on there that you think is genius.
*  If I think I've written a genius song ever, I think I'd probably stop. I think I'd be like,
*  you know what? Did it. I wrote, what's that perfect song? Imagine. Imagine. Yeah. Okay.
*  If I'd written Imagine, I'd probably be like, that's it, did it. All right. Perfect song has
*  been written. That's the best thing I'll ever do. So the fact that there is like self criticism and
*  criticism outside, I think is necessary. A hundred, a hundred percent for sure. It pushes you.
*  It pushes you. It pushes you. It's just finding the right middle ground for that young aspiring
*  artist to also not feel squashed and to be heard and to love just to not even to feel squashed,
*  just to love themself so that when they're in the room playing the song, they'll believe it because
*  they believe themself. They love themself enough that they believe it. And then they'll do great.
*  And then the song will come out great and they'll do a great performance.
*  I have to ask, it's one of the very interesting aspects of your life, of the way you put love
*  out there in the world. What is at the core of your support for the LGBT community?
*  A couple things. So one, growing up in from a young age in the artist community,
*  a lot of my closest friends were LGBTQ, starting in middle school. And I think a lot of the best
*  artists in the world are LGBTQ and that's just, it's not a secret. It just is. The artist community
*  is filled with lots of LGBTQ people. So I think being raised in that community, in that my friends
*  struggled with their faith and their sexuality really opened up my eyes to how incredibly hard
*  that path is. For instance, okay, when I was in high school, there was someone who went in front of
*  who was LGBTQ and was Mormon and felt like there was not a place for them in the church.
*  They felt like the path, when you're being told that it's evil and you believe it,
*  because you believe in your faith and you feel like it's unchangeable, you're putting a kid in
*  a situation where there's really no good resolution. It's either be alone for the rest of your life
*  or marry outside your sexual preference, which I don't want to marry a man. If I was forced to
*  marry a man, I'm like, I don't want to. I don't want to marry a gay man because I'm heterosexual.
*  You're forcing a kid into a situation where it's very dangerous. Long story short, this kid went
*  in front of the Las Vegas Mormon temple and killed himself. That impacted our community.
*  Not just that, but it was like severe bullying to LGBTQ kids. In the 90s, it was especially
*  different. There's still bullying, don't get me wrong, but man, bullying in school, I don't
*  really know actually what it's like in schools now. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I don't know.
*  Actually, what it's like in schools now, maybe the bullying is just as bad as it was in the 90s,
*  but there was like, it was like I would hear all the time, like the f slur being slung out at people
*  who were LGBTQ all the time. I wasn't even LGBTQ. Just seeing that, I think that every
*  social justice issue takes all sides. It takes all pieces of the puzzle. If only the pieces of the
*  puzzle contributed are from the side that is affected, I don't believe that we'll ever have
*  resolution. We're doing a shit job and we need to do better. That's just the reality of it.
*  That's part of the reason I also have family who's LGBTQ and it's just something that's been part of
*  my path. I feel like I'm a big believer in take the path that is presented to you. This was just
*  something that came up in my life a lot. When I met my wife, she was living with her two best
*  friends who were LGBTQ who really didn't want her to marry me because I was Mormon. At the time,
*  it was Prop 8, which was Mormons were fighting against gay marriage. They didn't come to our
*  wedding and that really broke my wife's heart. It was just like because Mormonism represented
*  everything that was against their community. You felt you had to say something.
*  Yeah, I felt like by not saying anything, I was saying everything. I felt like by not speaking up
*  and being like, hey, Dan Reynolds is Mormon singer. Here's this new band, Magic Dragons,
*  and they're Mormons. It was like, okay, well, what do Mormons represent? They represent Prop 8.
*  What does Prop 8 represent? Bigotry towards the LGBTQ community. What do I do? Okay,
*  I can speak in every interview and be like, well, that's not me. I don't believe that too.
*  Or I could just be more active about it and especially when it's affecting my family
*  and friends throughout my entire life. It was like, all right, this seems like a path that you need
*  to go down. Long story short, it was a path that just presented itself through things in my life.
*  Just on that topic, religion and God give a lot of meaning to a lot of people.
*  It gives tradition that brings people together across the generations, but it also can hurt people.
*  What do you make about that tension? A source of meaning, but also a source of pain for people.
*  The reality is, at least to me, again, this is just my reality. I feel like I'm doing my dad's
*  thing every time I'm talking to him. I'm like, I don't really know.
*  You have become your father.
*  Yeah. The reality, and it's my reality, and it is the reality for sure. I think that
*  religion has brought a lot of hurt and pain to a lot of people.
*  Absolutely, it has. I don't think anybody can dispute that on either side.
*  Whether it's war, whether it's slaughtering of entire peoples, there's been a lot of pain
*  and suffering that has come from religion. My little thing that has been hard for me is a faith
*  crisis. I had religion and then I lost it and then I had nothing. For me, I was like,
*  well, religion did that to me. Then at one point, it's like, how much of my life am I just going to
*  complain about being raised Mormon or being depressed? As I get older, I'm like, okay, so
*  what? Okay, it's really hurt me, but were there any good things that came out of Mormonism?
*  Yeah, there's a lot of good things that have come to my family through Mormonism.
*  Closeness, we're really, really close. Mormon culture is that you live together for a long time.
*  Culture is that you live together forever. The teaching is that your families are forever. We
*  die and then we go to heaven together and we're together forever. My family really believes that
*  principle. All of them do. That instills a certain way of living that's kind of beautiful.
*  Even if it's naivety, there's something kind of beautiful about believing that we're forming
*  these bonds together as a family and that we're going to be together forever. It brings a lot
*  of comfort to a kid too. When I was little, I was like, wow, it's going to be okay if I die
*  because I get to see my mom again. I really believe that. Is the right answer that you tell that kid,
*  actually, when you die, you're not going to see your mom again? Maybe. It might be. I don't know.
*  Anybody who has a kid is going to face that moment. I've already faced it where you sit down and my
*  kid was like, hey, dad, when you die, am I going to see you again? That was actually a really hard
*  moment for me because I was suddenly faced with, okay, do I give the answer that I thought was
*  bullshit or do I give the answer of what I think it is or do I give the real answer, which is,
*  I don't know? That's what I chose, which as a father, that's not always the easiest answer
*  because your kid, it's a wonderful thing that you feel like you can give your kid the comfort of,
*  hey, your parents are going to take care of everything. We know everything. We've been
*  around. My kid's always like, are you the strongest? I'm like, yeah, I am the strongest.
*  Stronger than everybody? Yeah. Yeah. So when you're faced with that moment, it's like,
*  it kind of sucks to tell your kid, you know what? I don't know if you're going to see me after I die,
*  but I hope. That's what I said. I was like, I don't know, but I hope. I really hope because
*  that would be awesome if we can hang out forever. And if there's any way for it to happen, I'll make
*  it happen. You know what I mean? That's kind of what my answer was. So long story short, sorry,
*  I know that I'm being lengthy on this. What is my thought on religion? It just is. It's been here
*  forever. It's coping. I can't say whether it's true or false. How the hell am I supposed to know?
*  I've lived 34 years on this planet. A lot of people have been around a lot longer than me
*  and they really believe very deeply and a lot of them are smarter than me. You know what I mean?
*  I look at my older brothers, for instance, who are very practicing Mormons. These guys are
*  hyper-intelligent. My younger sister, hyper-intelligent. All of them start smarter
*  than me. They all believe it still. So what am I supposed to say? Well, you're all stupid.
*  You know what I mean? You're all wrong. I don't know. Maybe it's the South Park episode where
*  everybody dies and then they're like, well, the right answer was Mormonism. And everyone's like,
*  aww. Mormons love that moment in South Park. They're like, hey, that day may come.
*  Yes. So maybe I don't know is the honest answer for everybody around the table. But the biggest
*  question for which I don't know is the right answer is what's the meaning of this whole thing?
*  What's the meaning of life? No, you're not allowed to say I don't know.
*  You can be just like your dad and say, let me just give my two cents.
*  Take it for whatever it's worth. Take it or leave it. It's probably worth nothing. It's
*  pittled on the ground. Why are we here? It's just busily creating all these kinds of things,
*  worrying about things, having kids. My purpose, at least right now,
*  is to wake up and try to
*  bring light love to the world, light love to myself, and have integrity. That's my purpose.
*  The ultimate purpose of life, I guess that's my ultimate purpose of life. I don't know what
*  happens when I die. Ayahuasca gave me some sense that there's more to be known. I'm sure there are
*  other things in life that would give me that. I'm looking for it. I'm a seeker. I'm always looking
*  for the next something to give me hope in something more, even if so I could just not bullshit my kids
*  when they ask me that question and be like, you know what? I really don't know. I want to not know
*  more, if that makes sense. I want to see things that make me confused, that make me question what
*  I already knew. When I meet an atheist who comes up to me and they're like, atheism, atheism,
*  atheism. It's just as laughable to me as when I meet the Mormon who comes up and they're like,
*  Mormonism, Mormonism, Mormonism. How do you guys know?
*  Through all your travels, through all the people you meet, you feel like you're still keeping your
*  eyes open and your heart open to discover something new, like the Ayahuasca experience.
*  That there might be deeper truths out there.
*  Yeah, and I want to find them and I want to surround myself with people who are just looking
*  for it. I'm not interested in people who are just looking to point fingers at each. Life is so short.
*  I'm looking for... It's one of the reasons that I want to meet with you is I was like, wow,
*  Lex really seems like he's on a journey to find truth. And that humility for me is same thing with
*  Rick. It drew me to Rick. It was like, I really see that and I identify with it and that's what
*  I'm looking for. There's the final song on our record, our new record that's coming out.
*  The chorus goes... And this is my best answer to what you're asking. The chorus goes...
*  Can we just hope for the best? Take it easy. That's it for me. It's like, I'm going to play
*  some from like, I don't know. Tell me, you know, I'm not going to believe you. Maybe you do. I'm
*  not going to believe it, but like, let's just be easier on each other and like try to find truth
*  wherever it may lie. But above all, know that we don't know jack shit.
*  I think that's a mic drop moment. Dan, thank you so much. You're an incredible human. I love that
*  you share with the world the darkness of your mind, of your life experience and the beautiful
*  light that you've shown to the world. So it's a huge honor and thank you for spending your
*  valuable time. Good luck on the tour. Thanks, man. Thanks for having me.
*  Thanks for listening to this conversation with Dan Reynolds. To support this podcast,
*  please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from
*  Aldous Huxley. After silence, that which comes nearest to expressing the inexpressible is music.
*  Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
