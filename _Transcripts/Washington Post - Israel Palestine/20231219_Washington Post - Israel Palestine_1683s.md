Video Description: When Israeli military leaders said in 2021 that a $1 billion revamp of the long-standing barrier along the Gaza Strip would prevent incursions from Hamas, people living in the nearby Kfar Aza kibbutz trusted them.

“They build a big wall, they said to us,” resident Israel Lender, 65, said in an interview for this film, a collaboration between The Washington Post and @frontline. “We believed that this can protect us,” he said.

The documentary examines the barrier’s catastrophic failure. The investigation found that the so-called Iron Wall was in fact a fragile barrier that gave Israel a false sense of security. A dependence on the structure and its sophisticated surveillance tools ultimately blinded Israel to its own vulnerabilities — and to a meticulous plan of attack that was taking shape on the other side.

The film expands on a visual investigation published by The Post last month, which reconstructed the attack: https://youtu.be/mcSoNyNd428?si=24wsaKmi5GO9k2N8

Reporters analyzed hundreds of videos, photos, and audio recordings from before, during and after the assault by Hamas. The Post also examined maps and planning documents recovered from slain Hamas fighters.

In retaliation for the Hamas attack, Israel unleashed a war in Gaza that has so far killed more than 18,000 Palestinian civilians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Israel has vowed to eradicate Hamas, which controls the densely populated enclave. 

The film premieres Tuesday on PBS and streaming platforms and online at washingtonpost.com. Subscribe to The Washington Post on YouTube: https://wapo.st/2QOdcqK

*  More than 20 years we are suffering from a rocket ship. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=61.0s)]
*  Before October 7th had anyone intruded? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=65.0s)]
*  Have they come into the kibbutz or was that the first day that people... [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=68.0s)]
*  This is the first day. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=71.0s)]
*  I met Israel Lender in Kfar Aza, near the border with Gaza, in the weeks after the Hamas massacre that left around 60 of his neighbours dead. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=72.0s)]
*  This is my house. You see now they covered all the glasses was broken. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=81.0s)]
*  From here they can see all the streets. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=89.0s)]
*  So they came here, they went on your roof. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=94.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=96.0s)]
*  So they could have a view of the rest of the kibbutz. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=97.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=100.0s)]
*  He told me Hamas gunmen stormed his house shortly after sunrise and turned it into a sniper's nest. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=102.0s)]
*  He hid with his wife in a nearby room for 36 hours. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=109.0s)]
*  The door was closed, the windows were closed and the glass was open so I could hear everything. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=112.0s)]
*  Everything. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=122.0s)]
*  Terrible. You can't think about it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=141.0s)]
*  You can't believe it. You can't imagine it. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=152.0s)]
*  What they did here, nobody can. They built a big wall. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=157.0s)]
*  They said to us, 40 metres in the ground with the sensors that nobody can and six metres up. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=165.0s)]
*  They said this will protect you. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=175.0s)]
*  They just broke through. They came through. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=176.0s)]
*  They came through. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=178.0s)]
*  On the morning of October 7th, more than a thousand fighters from the Palestinian militant group Hamas broke through the 20-foot high barrier that has last separated Israel from the Gaza Strip, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=207.0s)]
*  a densely populated enclave that is home to more than two million people. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=218.0s)]
*  The 40-mile long barrier is outfitted with cutting-edge surveillance tools, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=226.0s)]
*  a deep underground concrete layer to block Hamas tunnels [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=231.0s)]
*  and remote-control machine guns above ground. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=234.0s)]
*  After a billion-dollar upgrade in 2021, Israeli officials dubbed it the Iron Wall. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=239.0s)]
*  They are building a barren wall with concrete and sensors between it and the residents of the south. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=245.0s)]
*  But in a matter of minutes, Hamas was able to breach the fence in around 30 locations, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=252.0s)]
*  the start of what would become the deadliest single assault in Israel's history. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=258.0s)]
*  Around 1,200 people were killed, 240 taken hostage. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=262.0s)]
*  The attack triggered a catastrophic war in Gaza that has killed thousands of Palestinians so far. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=269.0s)]
*  Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas, which has controlled the territory for years. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=275.0s)]
*  Broadly, the fighters entered at 6.40am. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=283.0s)]
*  And that's the same incident just from the other side of the street? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=286.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=289.0s)]
*  Soon after the October 7th attack, the Washington Post began investigating [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=291.0s)]
*  how the so-called Iron Wall could have failed so spectacularly. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=295.0s)]
*  Our team of reporters analyzed hundreds of videos, photos and audio recordings from before, during and after the attack. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=300.0s)]
*  With Frontline, we spoke with witnesses on the ground. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=308.0s)]
*  We got hit with the first RPG. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=311.0s)]
*  We examined maps and planning documents recovered from Hamas fighters. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=313.0s)]
*  We took the visual evidence from October 7th and mapped it across southern Israel and inside the Gaza Strip, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=318.0s)]
*  sometimes using the position of the sun to estimate when key events occurred. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=324.0s)]
*  What we found was a fragile barrier that gave Israel a false sense of security, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=331.0s)]
*  leaving it blind to its own vulnerabilities and to the meticulous plan taking shape on the other side of the fence. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=335.0s)]
*  The attack began at dawn around 6.15am. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=347.0s)]
*  Videos recovered from Hamas fighters show them setting off from Gaza and heading towards the fence, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=351.0s)]
*  which has long been resented by Gazans who've been penned in by it. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=357.0s)]
*  People along the road cheered them on. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=367.0s)]
*  Around 6.30am, as fighters made their way to the fence, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=378.0s)]
*  Hamas began firing a barrage of thousands of rockets at targets across the barrier. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=382.0s)]
*  In just the first five minutes of the attack, there were red alerts for more than 30 communities near the Israeli side of the wall. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=390.0s)]
*  In Kibbutz Erez, less than a mile from the barrier, Ben Saddan, a member of the community security, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=398.0s)]
*  had just woken up for an early morning bike ride. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=405.0s)]
*  6am, coffee, sitting in the table, 6.30am, rocket launchers and a crazy red color. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=410.0s)]
*  We don't remember anything that was so intense. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=418.0s)]
*  So over there we can see Gaza. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=423.0s)]
*  There. Yeah. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=425.0s)]
*  And the security fence, you can see it running along there, and there's the towers with the machine gun. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=427.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is the border. On the left side it's Gaza, on the right side, the Israeli settlement. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=432.0s)]
*  And I think some of the earliest rockets came over just around here. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=439.0s)]
*  All around. All around. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=443.0s)]
*  We stand here and see everything, rockets going north, rockets that are falling here, bombs, everything. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=444.0s)]
*  All the skies are clear. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=450.0s)]
*  From this hilltop, the next wave of Hamas' attack became visible. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=454.0s)]
*  Reconnaissance fighters on paragliders soaring over the wall, undercover from the rockets. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=458.0s)]
*  Videos we obtained show them landing in communities inside Israel. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=466.0s)]
*  The culmination of a plan that had been years in the making. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=470.0s)]
*  And that, as we discovered, had been brewing in plain sight. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=473.0s)]
*  When I first saw this video, I was like, oh, this is video from the day of, like, how did they get this produced out so quickly? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=477.0s)]
*  And then once you look closer, go, it's obviously a training video. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=484.0s)]
*  Our investigation found multiple videos recorded by Hamas detailing their planning measures. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=490.0s)]
*  Some were posted on social media before the attack, visible to all. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=496.0s)]
*  We found videos of militants training for attacks on mock-ups of Israeli compounds. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=501.0s)]
*  Videos posted soon after the attack showed they had also been practicing the use of power. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=506.0s)]
*  Hamas had also been expanding their training camps, activity that was visible in widely available online maps. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=511.0s)]
*  But this evidence was largely ignored or dismissed by Israeli intelligence and the military, our investigation found. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=518.0s)]
*  Michael Milstein is a former head of the Palestinian Department for Israel's military intelligence. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=529.0s)]
*  He has been strongly critical of their misdeeds. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=534.0s)]
*  Israel knew about the whole plans because, you know, Hamas didn't hide them. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=537.0s)]
*  It was on public, on their internet sites, on their TV, everywhere. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=542.0s)]
*  From the operational tactic point of view, October the 7th, Israel IDF didn't face any surprise over there. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=547.0s)]
*  Were there specific warnings that something like this could be coming? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=558.0s)]
*  Well, according to the reports in the Israeli media, there was a very focused report about the whole plan, the whole offensive plan that promoted. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=562.0s)]
*  And actually the data, the reports itself were known, even to the Israeli intelligence. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=574.0s)]
*  But the basic assumption, the basic assessment in the intelligence was that those are only trainings or a theoretic attempt. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=581.0s)]
*  But we are not speaking about something which is very feasible. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=591.0s)]
*  The Israeli intelligence is not a very good intelligence. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=598.0s)]
*  The heart of Hamas' operation on October 7th was the stage that their videos called the blinding plan aimed at severing the connections to Israel's surveillance and security system. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=602.0s)]
*  Israel uses seven SkyStar surveillance bullets to track down the attacks. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=616.0s)]
*  The balloons carry a long-range 360-degree camera. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=622.0s)]
*  But the model of camera that Israel uses on the balloons is relatively old and is no longer made. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=627.0s)]
*  On the morning of October 7th, we found that three of the seven balloons were in need of maintenance and out of service. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=633.0s)]
*  The camera was used to monitor the attacks. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=640.0s)]
*  The video from the attack shows one of the remaining balloons. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=643.0s)]
*  We were told it had been cut loose by the militants. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=647.0s)]
*  The balloons are part of a system that includes surveillance and weapons towers. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=652.0s)]
*  Visuals and other data from the towers are fed into monitoring centers inside Israel. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=657.0s)]
*  The surveillance and weapons towers are the most important part of the operation. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=662.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter how many combat soldiers they are, if they don't know where the enemy is, they can't fight the enemy. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=666.0s)]
*  Rotem Horowitz spent two years monitoring the camera feeds at Reim before completing her military service last spring. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=674.0s)]
*  Three of the balloons were out of service on the day they were shot. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=681.0s)]

*  containing HD cameras, laser and infrared sensors and radar... [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=753.0s)]
*  and can see people for almost six miles away, according to the manufacturer. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=758.0s)]
*  Other structures called sentry tech towers... [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=763.0s)]
*  are topped with Samson weapon stations, which feature machine guns and sensors. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=767.0s)]
*  They're positioned every few hundred yards along the barrier... [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=772.0s)]
*  military facilities, and are nicknamed Roeh Yoray, Hebrew for seize fires. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=775.0s)]
*  Once the sensors send an intruder alert, IDF personnel can fire the 50 caliber machine [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=782.6s)]
*  guns by remote control. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=787.44s)]
*  We have to really make sure that we can firmly see a weapon and a threat before we can actually [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=789.24s)]
*  do anything with it. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=796.5s)]
*  So usually, like if someone's getting close to the fence, we use it to kind of not shoot [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=797.84s)]
*  at them, but shoot near them to kind of like scare them away, like don't come close. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=802.88s)]
*  You know, we're not going to touch them if they don't come close. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=806.4399999999999s)]
*  The moment they're showing that they're a threat and they're coming close, that's when [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=808.88s)]
*  we start to act. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=811.64s)]
*  A video from one of the sentry towers on October 7th shows it firing on a group of Hamas fighters [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=817.16s)]
*  as they approach the fence near Kisufim. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=822.68s)]
*  But that's not what happened elsewhere. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=828.7199999999999s)]
*  Hamas fighters had come prepared to evade the towers, and documents recovered after [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=832.52s)]
*  the attack reveal a deep and detailed knowledge of Israeli defenses. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=837.16s)]
*  In this one, they specifically note the locations of surveillance systems. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=842.08s)]
*  Fighters also carry with them open source satellite imagery annotated with coded locations [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=848.16s)]
*  of key structures along the wall. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=853.72s)]
*  Armed with this information, Hamas carried out their blinding plan using unmanned drones [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=857.52s)]
*  equipped with cameras to drop explosives on installations like this surveillance tower [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=861.64s)]
*  near the community of Behr-e. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=866.4s)]
*  Of the sentry tech towers marked on the map, we verified videos of at least two of them [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=870.84s)]
*  being attacked. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=875.28s)]
*  This one, located near Kfar Aza, was attacked twice by Hamas drones. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=877.76s)]
*  Incendiary explosive devices with fuses were dropped on the camera and weapon system. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=883.12s)]
*  Some of the training videos we found posted online show that these drone maneuvers had [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=890.96s)]
*  been well rehearsed. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=894.84s)]
*  Other videos from the seventh show towers being attacked with rocket-propelled grenades [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=897.96s)]
*  and gunfire. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=903.0400000000001s)]
*  It's hard to tell just from the video evidence how badly damaged the installations were. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=905.64s)]
*  Hi, thank you so much for your time. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=910.76s)]
*  I really appreciate you coming and seeing us tonight. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=914.9200000000001s)]
*  Retired Colonel Danny Tierzer, the former head of the Israeli Military's Fence Administration, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=917.1999999999999s)]
*  told me Hamas' blinding plan drastically undermined Israel's ability to respond to the attack. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=922.8s)]
*  That was a real failure because they succeeded to cut the command system. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=929.64s)]
*  The command system of all this area was built on one control system and they succeeded to [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=937.8s)]
*  And therefore, we couldn't use helicopters because according to the Israeli system, the [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=947.52s)]
*  helicopters cannot shoot if there is no someone on the ground that showed them where are your [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=954.88s)]
*  forces, where are the other side forces. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=960.88s)]
*  So they came but they couldn't shoot because they didn't know who and what is going on there. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=963.88s)]
*  In 2021, when the latest upgrade was unveiled, some of the political and military leaders [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=969.84s)]
*  made very firm, quite bold claims for the barrier. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=977.1600000000001s)]
*  They said this will protect the residents in the south, Hamas will not get in. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=980.84s)]
*  And was that a mistake to promise those things? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=987.4s)]
*  Of course it was a mistake. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=993.4s)]
*  We really thought that we were building a very good infrastructure that will help save [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=995.84s)]
*  the lives of the Israelis. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1000.8000000000001s)]
*  Unfortunately, it didn't work. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1003.2800000000001s)]
*  He said the attack exposed a fundamental misconception about the fence. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1006.76s)]
*  It was built against people that will try to cross it. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1011.88s)]
*  It wasn't built against army or against a lot of people that are coming in one time. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1015.48s)]
*  Were you surprised, you personally surprised at how quickly they were able to blast through [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1022.56s)]
*  and make it into the bases and beyond? [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1028.76s)]
*  I myself was not surprised that they crossed it so quickly because the fence is not built [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1033.24s)]
*  for such fright. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1042.92s)]
*  It was built for another thing. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1044.76s)]
*  If you want to stop an army, you are doing it with army tools. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1046.68s)]
*  If you want to stop one, two, three terrorists, you are doing it with soft tools like what [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1051.52s)]
*  we did. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1057.28s)]
*  We didn't thought that there will come a terror army from the other side. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1058.6s)]
*  They were crossing at the same time big groups and we were not prepared for it. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1062.96s)]
*  The Israeli government says Hamas broke through the fence in around 30 locations. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1075.04s)]
*  We obtained videos from 14 of them. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1080.48s)]
*  The videos show trained Hamas fighters using explosives and munitions to blow holes in [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1087.28s)]
*  the fence and its concrete barriers. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1091.72s)]
*  It took them only minutes. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1099.6s)]
*  By around 6.40am, Israel's iron wall had largely crumbled. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1103.36s)]
*  In the weeks that have followed, Israel's military and intelligence establishments have [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1122.0s)]
*  come under intense criticism. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1125.6399999999999s)]
*  A spokesman for the Israeli Defence Forces, Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner, agreed to [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1129.2s)]
*  speak with me at a military base in Tel Aviv. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1133.92s)]
*  Hamas has published several training videos which appear to show fighters in the months [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1137.68s)]
*  before practising specific tactics that were then used on the day, blowing up fences, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1143.84s)]
*  paragliding and so on. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1151.04s)]
*  Did Israel not see this? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1153.56s)]
*  I mean we're looking at what exactly transpired before the 7th of October and there will be [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1158.16s)]
*  a time when the IDF will be doing that soul searching that is required and the IDF will [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1164.8000000000002s)]
*  review that and those that need to take responsibility will have to take responsibility. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1170.16s)]
*  What do you think October 7th says about the integrity of that barrier? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1176.52s)]
*  The barrier itself is a concept that was perceived to be a strong line of defence. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1182.16s)]
*  But any line of defence can only withhold a certain amount of pressure. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1189.12s)]
*  I think the question is not necessarily what is the barrier but what was the threat assessment. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1193.76s)]
*  These are the types of questions that we will be asking. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1198.96s)]
*  These are the types of questions that the answers to the residents of those towns of [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1201.44s)]
*  We owe them clarification and accountability for the failure of not defence but the whole [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1206.8000000000002s)]
*  concept of operations and this I think is what the IDF will be looking into when the war is over. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1217.2s)]
*  The Hamas fighters that broke through the fence that morning were bound for the military bases and communities along the border. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1225.84s)]
*  One group headed for Kibbutz Erez where Ben Saddan and the rest of his security team had [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1245.04s)]
*  already armed themselves and watched with dismay as the fighters kept coming. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1250.16s)]
*  And they're carrying weapons? [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1263.44s)]
*  What kind of things are they carrying? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1268.0s)]
*  How many of them were there? How many of your men were there? [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1280.88s)]
*  He told me the combat lasted three hours. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1301.3600000000001s)]
*  After these few hours of fighting, what happened next? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1305.28s)]
*  It just stopped. It stopped. The fight here and there was just silent. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1309.2s)]
*  You didn't leave the area. We stayed here. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1315.92s)]
*  Even in the air because we didn't know what was going on. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1318.3200000000002s)]
*  But it was just silent. It stopped. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1322.0s)]
*  Saddan and his team had avoided the potential massacre. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1329.44s)]
*  Breaking news out of Israel. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1332.88s)]
*  Chaos erupting in Israel. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1334.96s)]
*  But other communities were overrun. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1337.04s)]
*  Hamas militants currently attacking citizens. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1339.44s)]
*  Shooting at people on the streets. Attacking troops. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1342.24s)]
*  At 7.01, the first Hamas gunmen broke through the gate at Kfar Aza. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1344.56s)]
*  We are in Kibbutz Kfar Aza. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1349.28s)]
*  More than 250 others would follow throughout the morning. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1351.2s)]
*  You can see this massacre. It smells of death here. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1354.48s)]
*  Some of the fighters wore body cameras. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1357.2s)]
*  And the videos recovered later showed the rampage through the Kibbutz. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1359.6000000000001s)]
*  So this is my place. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1387.52s)]
*  Yuri Levin witnessed the violence that day and told me he'd barely escaped [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1400.0800000000002s)]
*  being kidnapped and taken to Gaza. A fate that befell many of his neighbours. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1403.92s)]
*  And these are all friends of yours? You knew everyone? [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1412.8s)]
*  She kidnapped. He is moderate. He is also kidnapped. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1417.68s)]
*  Moderate. And two of them kidnapped, I think. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1425.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1428.24s)]
*  Yes, I think I know. And this is friends of me. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1428.64s)]
*  Across the street, a group of his friends were returning home for the first time since the attack. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1434.24s)]
*  It's him. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1447.76s)]
*  The first time? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1462.4s)]
*  First time? [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1467.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm not going home, man. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1468.72s)]
*  I mean, the first time I see it in movies, I see it in real life, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1470.24s)]
*  but seeing it in real life, it's not... [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1476.24s)]
*  It's not, man. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWoP3EZM6A0&t=1481.24s)]
