# What was Israelâ€™s blockade of Gaza like before the war?
**Washington Post - Israel Palestine:** [November 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4)
*  In the 16 years since Hamas took power in the Gaza Strip, Israel has controlled the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=0.0s)]
*  movement of nearly all goods and civilians in this small stretch of land. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=4.84s)]
*  Israel says this blockade is necessary to protect its own citizens from terrorism. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=9.4s)]
*  And Egypt, which borders Gaza to the south, also supports the blockade. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=13.76s)]
*  The closure has changed over time, according to the Israeli nonprofit Gisha, which advocates [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=18.2s)]
*  for the freedom of movement of Gazans. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=22.16s)]
*  The idea was that you put pressure on the population, but not enough so that it blows [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  up. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=29.64s)]
*  We likened it sometimes to a pot of water that you have, you know, very, very hot, but [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=30.64s)]
*  trying to keep it from boiling, you're pouring in a little bit of cold water once in a while. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=36.4s)]
*  There are two published lists that show what items are restricted from going through the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=42.16s)]
*  crossings. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=45.4s)]
*  One list is common to the West Bank and Gaza. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  There's also an extra list only for Gaza. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  The lists have included broad categories like communication equipment and navigation equipment. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=51.22s)]
*  These broad categories make it difficult for Gazans to know what exactly is allowed [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=56.08s)]
*  through these crossings. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=59.72s)]
*  And these lists have changed over time. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=60.72s)]
*  At one point, items that have been barred from entering Gaza included toys, paper, chocolate, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=62.76s)]
*  tea and wood. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=68.2s)]
*  In 2009, an Israeli human rights group submitted a petition requesting Israel to disclose their [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=69.2s)]
*  policy of what food and other goods could be transferred to the Strip. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=74.28s)]
*  The case revealed there were documents in the Israeli army's possession showing efforts [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=77.92s)]
*  to calculate the number of calories each Gaza needed to survive. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=81.36s)]
*  This information informed Israel's border crossing restrictions on food items. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=85.72s)]
*  It was a real attempt on purpose to kind of push people down to a minimum standard rather [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=89.28s)]
*  than in other situations of need in the world where you're trying to, you know, push the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=95.76s)]
*  standard up. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  Luckily, the policy did change and food was allowed in. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  But still, you know, the damage that that had been done and that continued to be done [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=106.48s)]
*  to the economy over the years meant that even if the food is allowed in, you have so many [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=111.4s)]
*  people who can't afford to buy it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=117.0s)]
*  Israel in 2010 introduced sweeping travel restrictions that limited movement between Gaza, the West [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=120.4s)]
*  Bank and Israel. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=125.4s)]
*  In order to leave the Strip, Gazans had to fall into one of three categories, medical [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=127.28s)]
*  patients, workers or humanitarian cases. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=131.68s)]
*  It wasn't enough, let's say, just that you hadn't seen your mother in 10 years and you [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  missed her. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=139.64000000000001s)]
*  It wouldn't have been enough if, let's say, your daughter was giving birth and you wanted [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=141.32s)]
*  to be by her side and you'd have to prove to Israel that your parent was actually on [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=144.96s)]
*  the verge of death or gravely ill in order to get a permit. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=152.4s)]
*  We found ourselves in many cases working on behalf of our clients, having to provide further [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=155.68s)]
*  documentation and getting into real arguments with the Israeli military just about how ill [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=161.08s)]
*  this person's parent was. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=167.2s)]
*  Even if you were part of one of these groups, travel could be denied. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=170.4s)]
*  Application processing can take weeks, even for medical emergencies. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=173.96s)]
*  Applications could be denied without giving an explanation, and tens of thousands of applications [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=177.8s)]
*  each year received no response at all. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=181.72s)]
*  Following a Hamas attack on October 7th, Israel soon closed all crossings that remained open [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=184.32s)]
*  into Gaza. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  This included the transport of food, fuel, water and medical supplies. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=190.12s)]
*  Aid trucks have now started slowly re-entering the Strip through the Rafa crossing, and a [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=194.76s)]
*  limited number of people, including some foreign nationals, were able to cross into Egypt. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=198.51999999999998s)]
*  But officials are left wondering how these crossings will remain open and what will be [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=203.79999999999998s)]
*  allowed to enter. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=207.28s)]
*  Most of the population are children and young people. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=209.06s)]
*  About 70% of the population are under the age of 30. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=212.16s)]
*  Most of those people never left Gaza, actually. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=216.16s)]
*  They never saw Jerusalem. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=219.28s)]
*  They never saw Ramallah. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=222.32s)]
*  They never saw Haifa. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=223.64s)]
*  A lot of young people without hope for their future and a real sense of hopelessness. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4XpFYcz4&t=225.32s)]
