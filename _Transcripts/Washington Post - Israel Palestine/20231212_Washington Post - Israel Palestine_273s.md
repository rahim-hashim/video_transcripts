# Will Israel’s ‘third phase’ of war be any different?
**Washington Post - Israel Palestine:** [December 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY)
*  A barrage of booms rattled windows and roadways across the Gaza Strip on December 1, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=0.0s)]
*  as a fragile pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas came to an abrupt end. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=5.28s)]
*  The truce was negotiated after seven weeks of war, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=10.0s)]
*  sparked by a Hamas attack on Israel on October 7. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  But talks to extend the pause collapsed, and fighting swiftly resumed. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=16.32s)]
*  The end of the truce brought a third phase of the war, and with it, continued uncertainty [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=20.64s)]
*  in how Israel would carry out its stated goal of eliminating Hamas, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=24.96s)]
*  and whether its tactics, which have already killed thousands of civilians, would change. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=28.639999999999997s)]
*  Washington Post national security reporter Michael Birnbaum was in Israel, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=33.12s)]
*  traveling with Secretary of State Antony Blinken when the truce collapsed. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=36.56s)]
*  We got into the vans and started speeding toward the airport within just a couple of minutes, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=40.48s)]
*  while we were still in motion. The Israelis started bombarding Gaza again. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=47.44s)]
*  I started getting little red alerts, push alerts on my phone saying rocket attacks are [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=52.8s)]
*  coming to Israel. It's a pretty messy end to that trip. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=58.24s)]
*  Within 24 hours, Israel's military said it had attacked more than 400 targets across the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=63.52s)]
*  That included more than 50 targets around the southern city of Khan Yunis, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=69.6s)]
*  an area where many Palestinians from the north were initially ordered to seek shelter. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=73.04s)]
*  Israel dropped leaflets into the city, ordering residents to immediately evacuate further south [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  to the city of Rafah, near the border with Egypt. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=82.80000000000001s)]
*  The leaflets included a QR code linking to a map dividing Gaza into hundreds of districts, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=85.84s)]
*  which Israel's military said would be used to communicate which areas were dangerous [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=91.12s)]
*  and safe to move into. But Gazans said the maps were riddled with problems. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  The question is, is that a temporary area that is going to be unsafe and are they then going to [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=99.2s)]
*  move the squares to different parts of Gaza and say that area is not going to be safe? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=105.92s)]
*  They expect Gazans who don't have electricity, don't have telecommunications, so no internet, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=110.96s)]
*  to scan the QR code on a smartphone that is probably dead and to look at a map online to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=117.6s)]
*  tell them where they should be. By December 6, the Israeli military said troops had entered [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=123.92s)]
*  Khan Yunis and engaged in some of the fiercest fighting in the war. More than 80 percent of [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=128.8s)]
*  Gazans have been displaced from their homes and an estimated 1.9 million Palestinians have sought [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  shelter in the south. Refugees are squeezing into tighter and tighter spaces, scrambling for [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=138.64s)]
*  dwindling aid as casualties are climbing. The catastrophic situation we see unfolding in the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=143.83999999999997s)]
*  Gaza Strip was entirely foreseeable and preventable, said a UN official on December 6. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=148.88s)]
*  My humanitarian colleagues have described the situation as apocalyptic. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=153.6s)]
*  The IDF spokesman in particular has indicated that it believes that it's doing a pretty good job [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  minimizing civilian death. For every one Hamas fighter that it has killed, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=163.68s)]
*  two Palestinian civilians have been killed. There may be 30,000 Hamas fighters. The idea of, you [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=170.24s)]
*  know, seeing upwards of 60,000 Palestinian civilians killed is really terrifying. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=180.32s)]
*  As Israel pushes further into the Gaza Strip, its stated goal is to destroy Hamas. That could take [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  years, some experts say. In the meantime, Israel believes there are 137 hostages still held inside [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=191.76s)]
*  the Strip. When the fighting does end, Israel has said it doesn't intend to stay in Gaza. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=197.84s)]
*  We'll take any measures in order to destroy Hamas, but we have no intention to stay permanently [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  in Gaza Strip. But it doesn't look like the fighting will stop anytime soon. A UN resolution [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  that would have demanded a ceasefire in Gaza was vetoed by the U.S. on December 8 that argued it [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=216.96s)]
*  would only benefit Hamas. Washington has begun discussing what Gaza could look like after the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=221.92000000000002s)]
*  war ends. The Biden administration is pushing to install the Palestinian Authority, which currently [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=226.8s)]
*  governs the occupied West Bank. It's an unpopular idea among the Israeli government and even among [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=231.60000000000002s)]
*  many Palestinians who believe the authority is corrupt and its leader Mahmoud Abbas is ineffective. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=236.72s)]
*  He hasn't faced voters in a very long time. He didn't hold elections again when he was supposed [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=241.92s)]
*  to because he was worried he would lose. They're not seen as reflecting the democratic will of [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=248.56s)]
*  the Palestinian people. It can't necessarily be UN peacekeepers. Israel says it doesn't fully [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=255.6s)]
*  trust the United Nations. There aren't great answers. It's a really tricky and messy situation [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  in the short run. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWto1GaJAY&t=267.52s)]
