# Why are there refugee camps in Gaza?
**Washington Post - Israel Palestine:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkUGFQFfj24)
*  A heavy bombardment from Israeli warplanes, responding to a Hamas attack on Israel, has [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkUGFQFfj24&t=0.0s)]
*  targeted large parts of the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkUGFQFfj24&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  These strikes have largely hit refugee camps inside Gaza. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkUGFQFfj24&t=8.88s)]
*  But what are refugee camps doing inside this small strip of land? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkUGFQFfj24&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  They were set up decades ago for Palestinians that fled, were forced to leave their homes, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkUGFQFfj24&t=15.72s)]
*  following the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, and again in the aftermath of the Six-Day War in 1967. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkUGFQFfj24&t=19.96s)]
*  Today there are eight recognized camps that span the Gaza Strip, according to the UN Relief [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkUGFQFfj24&t=26.72s)]
*  and Works Agency that operates them. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkUGFQFfj24&t=30.96s)]
*  They're home for about 1.7 million Palestinian refugees, including 286,000 students attending [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkUGFQFfj24&t=33.36s)]
*  183 schools, and there are over 20 health facilities. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkUGFQFfj24&t=39.96s)]
*  The largest of these camps is Jebelia. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkUGFQFfj24&t=44.16s)]
*  It's located north of Gaza City and covers an area of just under a square mile. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkUGFQFfj24&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  Camps like Jebelia, much like the rest of Gaza, have struggled to grow economically. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkUGFQFfj24&t=51.36s)]
*  Israel has indefinitely blockaded the strip by land, sea, and air since 2007 after Hamas [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkUGFQFfj24&t=56.4s)]
*  came to power. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkUGFQFfj24&t=61.4s)]
*  This economic embargo has led to the steady decline of Gaza's economy. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkUGFQFfj24&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  Over 80% of the strip lives in poverty. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkUGFQFfj24&t=67.64s)]
*  The unemployment rate is nearly 50%, and there are regular restrictions on what food and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkUGFQFfj24&t=70.08s)]
*  other items can be imported. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkUGFQFfj24&t=75.2s)]
*  This latest round of bombing is making life even more difficult. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkUGFQFfj24&t=77.64s)]
*  On October 9, Israeli airstrikes leveled the Jebelia camp. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkUGFQFfj24&t=80.48s)]
*  Four days later, residents across all of north Gaza were given 24-hour notice to leave their [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkUGFQFfj24&t=84.92s)]
*  homes and flee south as they braced for an expected wide-scale Israeli ground invasion. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkUGFQFfj24&t=89.16s)]
*  And at the moment, as border crossings remain closed, Palestinians have no way of leaving [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkUGFQFfj24&t=94.28s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkUGFQFfj24&t=99.47999999999999s)]
