Video Description: On the morning of June 8, Israeli commandos launched a raid that rescued four hostages who had been taken during Hamas’s attack on Oct. 7 and held inside Gaza for eight months. Before the operation, Israel had freed only three hostages by force. The successful rescue prompted celebrations inside Israel, but for Palestinians, it was one of the deadliest days of the war. The Gaza Health Ministry said that 274 Palestinians were killed during the operation. The Israeli military said that there were fewer than 100 casualties.

This Washington Post video investigation reconstructs the raid in which Israel sought to free hostages — Noa Argamani, Shlomi Ziv, Almog Meir Jan and Andrey Kozlov — that Hamas had hidden in a crowded residential area. It shows how the Israeli military employed heavy airstrikes for nearly four hours, leaving women and children among the casualties. The Post identified at least 13 airstrikes across Nuseirat, a refugee camp in central Gaza, and at least 17 destroyed structures in the vicinity of the raid.

The Post reviewed and mapped more than 100 videos and photos of the raid and its aftermath to conduct this detailed investigation — most were posted online by local residents and journalists, some were shared directly with The Post and others were published by the Israel Defense Forces on their social media channels.

# How an Israeli hostage rescue in Gaza unfolded | Visual Forensics

*  One [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=0.0s)]
*  On the morning of June 8th, Israeli commandos made their way into New Zayrat, in central [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=2.84s)]
*  Gaza, to conduct a covert rescue mission. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=8.8s)]
*  The raid freed four hostages and was a critical moment in the now 10-month war, which Israel [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  said it launched in part to rescue more than 200 people abducted by Hamas during their [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=18.48s)]
*  October 7th attack. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=23.56s)]
*  Prior to this operation, only three had been freed by force. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=26.12s)]
*  For Palestinians, the raid resulted in one of the deadliest days of the war, killing [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  274 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=35.68s)]
*  The Israeli military said that there were fewer than 100 casualties. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  Neither entity differentiated between civilians and combatants. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=43.8s)]
*  How did the raid, which had been meticulously planned for weeks, result in so many dead [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=49.56s)]
*  and wounded Palestinians? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=54.36s)]
*  The Post reviewed and mapped more than 100 videos and photos, booked 19 witnesses, and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=57.96s)]
*  analysed satellite imagery to reconstruct the raid. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=63.52s)]
*  Hamas had chosen to hold the hostages in two apartment buildings in a densely populated [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=67.68s)]
*  area. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  Visual evidence shows that the Israeli military employed heavy airstrikes on this area minutes [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=74.0s)]
*  after the raid began, destroying 17 structures and at least 13 strikes. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=78.64s)]
*  These strikes spanned a mile across New Zarat and lasted for nearly four hours, including [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  after the hostages had been safely evacuated. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=89.12s)]
*  Verified videos and records from healthcare workers showed women and children among the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=94.0s)]
*  casualties. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=98.4s)]
*  Their injuries appeared to come from explosive blasts, according to a surgeon who worked [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=100.48s)]
*  on around 70 patients for three days straight. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=105.08s)]
*  Preparation for the raid began weeks earlier, after Israeli intelligence, with US assistance, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=111.48s)]
*  discovered that four hostages were being held in two apartments in a residential area of [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=116.6s)]
*  New Zarat. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=121.16s)]
*  Before the war, New Zarat was the third largest refugee camp in Gaza. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=123.04s)]
*  In recent months, it had become crowded with even more displaced Palestinians. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=126.88s)]
*  The Israel Defence Forces told The Post that the operation was proof that Hamas is hiding [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=131.4s)]
*  behind civilians and that only military objectives were targeted during the operation. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=135.88s)]
*  In response to a request for comment, Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official, asked, where [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=141.84s)]
*  can Hamas hide them when all of Gaza is only two and a half inches wide? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=146.72s)]
*  In the first apartment was Noah Al-Ghamani, whose abduction on motorcycle from the Nova [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=151.68s)]
*  Music Festival had been seen around the world. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=156.6s)]
*  In the second, 240 yards away, were three men, Shlomi Ziv, Al Morghmeir Jehan, and Andrei [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=160.56s)]
*  Kozlov, who had also been taken from the festival that day. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=167.56s)]
*  On June 8th, the go order is given at 11am, according to the Israeli military. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=173.56s)]
*  They attack at midday to maximise surprise. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=179.12s)]
*  At the building holding Noah Al-Ghamani, this video captures her rescue by commandos. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=183.28s)]
*  They escape within minutes. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=188.64s)]
*  But at the apartment holding the three men, things go differently. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=191.92s)]
*  A white Mercedes van is spotted parked in front. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=195.83999999999997s)]
*  Around 11am, local resident Hussam Al-Arouki is walking back from a bakery with his brother [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=199.64s)]
*  Issam. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=205.6s)]
*  The soldiers shot and wounded Issam, who crawled into the ground floor of a building across [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=219.64s)]
*  the street. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=223.92s)]
*  The soldiers then enter the building by climbing ladders to an upper floor. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=230.76s)]
*  From the other side, a team of Yamam commandos, an elite counter-terrorism unit, storms the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=235.29999999999998s)]
*  building. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=240.27999999999997s)]
*  As they enter the building, they are fired upon by Hamas fighters, and a commander is [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=242.83999999999997s)]
*  fatally wounded. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=247.16s)]
*  But they reach the hostages. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  They rush the three men out of the rear of the building around 11.15. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=262.6s)]
*  Then, the first airstrikes begin. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=269.92s)]
*  Israeli officials said the strikes were called in to cover the evacuation, which was under [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=273.15999999999997s)]
*  attack by Hamas fighters. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=277.28000000000003s)]
*  At 11.28, Israeli aircraft pummeled the area where the hostages escaped just 13 minutes [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=297.0s)]
*  earlier. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=303.2s)]
*  Four Helfar missiles hit these buildings in quick succession. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=305.2s)]
*  Across the street, Nida al-Tarawi records this video at 11.36, 21 minutes after the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=319.2s)]
*  commandos rushed the three hostages out. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=325.76s)]
*  There is the sound of intense gunfire, and someone says Apache helicopters have arrived. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=329.28s)]
*  In the space of around 20 minutes, there have been at least eight strikes on Nuzarat. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=349.15999999999997s)]
*  A video filmed here, half a mile from the site of the raid, shows the aftermath of a [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=354.28s)]
*  strike. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=360.28s)]
*  At least 15 people are dead or severely wounded. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=361.28s)]
*  Another large strike is recorded near a busy market, not far from the apartment where the [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=366.28s)]
*  hostages were being held. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=370.59999999999997s)]
*  Because the raid is occurring during the day, the streets are full. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=372.59999999999997s)]
*  This video shows a child among the wounded being carried away. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=377.52s)]
*  At 11.55, the gunfire at the apartment has ended. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=382.28s)]
*  Al-Tarawi captures a brief lull. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=386.28s)]
*  The Mercedes-Benz van Israeli forces used to enter is still parked out front. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=390.28s)]
*  It's in this period of relative quiet, 45 minutes after the commandos rescued the three [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=395.28s)]
*  men, that the vehicles carrying them stop here, several metres away from a house that [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=401.28s)]
*  belongs to Abd al-Rauf Mugdad. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=406.28s)]
*  Her Brigadier General, Amir Avivi, told The Post about the breakdown. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=409.28s)]
*  While they wait for rescue, Noah Agamani's helicopter takes off near the US-built humanitarian [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=426.28s)]
*  pier, three miles north of Nuzarat. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=431.28s)]
*  Shortly after noon, paratroopers arrive outside Mugdad's home to rescue the remaining three [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=435.28s)]
*  hostages. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=440.28s)]

*  injured Yemen commander. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=468.28s)]
*  They enter Mugdad's home. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=473.28s)]
*  Mugdad told The Post that the paratroopers shot two of his grandsons, 12-year-old Yemen [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=477.28s)]
*  and 16-year-old Moamun. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gRW6KbqcY&t=485.28s)]
