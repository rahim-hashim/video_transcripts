# Why is the population in the Gaza Strip so young?
**Washington Post - Israel Palestine:** [December 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oblMn_72iXE)
*  The population in Gaza is among the youngest in the world. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oblMn_72iXE&t=0.0s)]
*  Of the more than 2 million people that live in this small stretch of land, nearly half [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oblMn_72iXE&t=4.32s)]
*  far under the age of 18, according to the United Nations. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oblMn_72iXE&t=7.88s)]
*  This means many of the civilians facing Israeli airstrikes, bracing for an anticipated ground [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oblMn_72iXE&t=11.52s)]
*  evasion are children. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oblMn_72iXE&t=15.36s)]
*  One reason the area has such a young population is that Gazans tend to marry in their early [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oblMn_72iXE&t=18.04s)]
*  twenties and have larger families. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oblMn_72iXE&t=21.76s)]
*  But even before the war, children were born into a depleted healthcare system, and access [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oblMn_72iXE&t=24.28s)]
*  to critical medical treatment as you grew older became more difficult. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oblMn_72iXE&t=28.259999999999998s)]
*  Israel's 16-year blockade of the strip, imposed after Hamas's control of the enclave in 2007, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oblMn_72iXE&t=31.98s)]
*  controls everything that goes in and out. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oblMn_72iXE&t=37.46s)]
*  This blockade has contributed to Gaza's medical shortfalls. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oblMn_72iXE&t=39.66s)]
*  To leave the strip for more advanced treatment, residents must apply for a permit that's [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oblMn_72iXE&t=42.78s)]
*  notoriously difficult to obtain. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oblMn_72iXE&t=46.42s)]
*  The average life expectancy in the Gaza Strip is about 75 years old. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oblMn_72iXE&t=48.94s)]
*  Meanwhile, in places like the United States and Israel, it's much higher. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oblMn_72iXE&t=52.86s)]
