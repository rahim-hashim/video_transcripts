*  I'm the only Palestinian-American serving in Congress, Mr. Chair, and my perspective [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-ZzIHsNTf8&t=0.0s)]
*  is needed here now more than ever. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-ZzIHsNTf8&t=4.3s)]
*  This movement for a ceasefire is much bigger than one person. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-ZzIHsNTf8&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  It's growing every single day. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-ZzIHsNTf8&t=10.64s)]
*  There are millions of people across our country who oppose Netanyahu's extremism and are [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-ZzIHsNTf8&t=12.96s)]
*  done watching our government support collective punishment and the use of white phosphorus [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-ZzIHsNTf8&t=18.02s)]
*  bombs that melt flesh to the bone. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-ZzIHsNTf8&t=22.12s)]
*  We are human beings, just like anyone else. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-ZzIHsNTf8&t=25.16s)]
*  My city, my grandmother, like all Palestinians, just wants to live her life with freedom [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-ZzIHsNTf8&t=28.8s)]
*  and human dignity we all deserve. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-ZzIHsNTf8&t=37.28s)]
*  Speaking up to save lives, Mr. Chair, no matter faith, no matter ethnicity, should not be [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-ZzIHsNTf8&t=40.88s)]
*  controversial in this chamber. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-ZzIHsNTf8&t=45.68s)]
*  The cries of the Palestinian and Israeli children sound no different to me. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-ZzIHsNTf8&t=47.84s)]
*  What? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-ZzIHsNTf8&t=53.16s)]
*  What I understand is why the cries of Palestinians sound different to you all. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-ZzIHsNTf8&t=54.16s)]
