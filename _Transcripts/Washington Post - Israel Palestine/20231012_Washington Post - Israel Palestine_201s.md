# Bodies still being found, counted in Israeli town of Be'eri
**Washington Post - Israel Palestine:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ)
*  So here we are, we are on Kibbutz Berry, just a few minutes drive from the Gaza border, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=0.0s)]
*  which is just beyond us. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=13.16s)]
*  This was really the greatest site of the massacre that was committed. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=14.68s)]
*  These residents were sleeping on Saturday morning when they were woken up by shouts [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=19.64s)]
*  and screaming in Arabic as gunmen went through it, which is a peaceful community. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  These are the people right now, their families are standing in line with their DNA to try [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=27.92s)]
*  to find them. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  They were either killed or taken hostage. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=32.24s)]
*  People locked themselves in the protection room that they have here and the terrorists [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=34.760000000000005s)]
*  go from room to room, from family to family, killed mothers with their son, killed their [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=39.2s)]
*  son in the front of the pens and took the pens. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=45.64s)]
*  In this building they collect 14 people and hold them as hostages, things that I never [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  saw and never think that I will see. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=56.199999999999996s)]
*  People that someone cut their hand, people that captured and their hand was locked and [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=60.599999999999994s)]
*  someone kills them, children in the same room, then someone come and kills them all, 15 girls [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=67.36s)]
*  and teenagers that put in the same room, 300 grenades and it's over. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=73.67999999999999s)]
*  This is a massacre, it's pogrom. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=78.8s)]
*  More than 100 people died in this community. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=83.12s)]
*  I can tell you that when we evacuated the families, we prepared hotels, the Israeli [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  government prepared hotels for them. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=90.72s)]
*  Many of those hotel rooms were never taken because so many people in this community never [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=93.32s)]
*  showed up. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=97.46s)]
*  They're either missing or dead or injured. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=98.46s)]
*  There's a fragment of this community that's left. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  So there are survivors in Israel that ran away, that we took them during the fight out [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=104.12s)]
*  of the kibbutz and there in Israel. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=111.44s)]
*  We don't know to count how much are in Israel, how much dead, how much kidnapped to Gaza, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=114.88s)]
*  how much we still didn't find. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=120.72s)]
*  We don't think that we found survival in the kibbutz, but I hope. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=123.56s)]
*  The last engagement with the terrorists was 12 or 14 hours ago. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=130.28s)]
*  We hope that we clean it from our bodies and took most of our people and our body back. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=138.36s)]
*  Hundreds and thousands of hand grenades, IED, booby traps and a terrorist body are still [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=145.76000000000002s)]
*  here. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=154.24s)]
*  And you know, a lot of other safety things that we need to clean, but the soldiers do [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=155.24s)]
*  it very carefully with a lot of commitment to the people and the honor of the dead. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=161.28s)]
*  This is the area that we understand that the entire nation is suffering so deeply. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=169.54s)]
*  And there's two thoughts going through our minds. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=175.86s)]
*  One is the suffering. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=177.52s)]
*  How do you even wake up in the morning and look at your children? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=178.52s)]
*  And the other feeling is we're going to put on a uniform and we're going to do what has [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=180.84s)]
*  to be done so that this can never ever happen to us again. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=185.08s)]
*  The symbol of this entire massacre is going to be where we're standing right now. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8y4GzHtmwQ&t=187.88s)]
