# Oct. 7: How a year of war unfolded in the Middle East
**Washington Post - Israel Palestine:** [October 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU)
*  In the years since the start of the Israel-Gaza war, the world has witnessed horror, shock, relief, perseverance, and uncertainty. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=0.0s)]
*  How did we get here? Let's look back on this last year. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=12.0s)]
*  The war began on October 7, when the militant group Hamas breached Israel's borders, attacking military bases, a music festival, and families in their homes across 20 Israeli communities. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=16.0s)]
*  Israeli officials said about 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 taken hostage. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=29.0s)]
*  That same day, Israel declared war on Hamas, launching intense airstrikes and a siege of Gaza, closing border crossings and restricting delivery of humanitarian aid. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=35.0s)]
*  Later that month, Israel began a full-scale ground invasion. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=47.0s)]
*  After weeks of battles, Israel and Hamas agreed to a pause in the fighting on November 24. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=51.0s)]
*  Hamas released 100 hostages, and Israel released 240 Palestinian prisoners. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=57.0s)]
*  Humanitarian aid delivery increased. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=62.0s)]
*  But heavy fighting resumed after seven days. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=65.0s)]
*  By late December, Gaza's Health Ministry recorded over 20,000 Palestinians killed. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=69.0s)]
*  In the new year, humanitarian warnings of imminent famine spurred countries to brainstorm how to get more aid into Gaza. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=74.0s)]
*  Some pressed Israel to allow in more trucks. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=81.0s)]
*  Others tried dropping aid boxes from planes. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=83.0s)]
*  On March 7, President Biden and his State of the Union address announced plans for a floating aid pier. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=86.0s)]
*  But the estimated $230 million project was plagued by problems. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=92.0s)]
*  By mid-July, the U.S. had permanently shuttered the project, and the need for aid in Gaza only increased. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=97.0s)]
*  Across the world, protests against the war were picking up steam. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=103.0s)]
*  On April 17, students at Columbia University occupied parts of campus, setting up tents and refusing to leave. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=107.0s)]
*  Similar demonstrations cropped up at other schools, drawing the attention of some in Congress. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=115.0s)]
*  House Republicans questioned the protesters' motives. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=120.0s)]
*  Columbia administrators called in police, who dismantled the encampment and arrested protesters. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=123.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, Israel was preparing for its most controversial military operation in Gaza yet. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=129.0s)]
*  On May 6, Israeli forces invaded the southern Gaza city of Rafa, where more than a million displaced Palestinians had sought refuge. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=135.0s)]
*  President Biden cautioned Israel that he would withhold weapons if troops moved into population centers. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=142.0s)]
*  But Israel was undeterred, sending forces into central Rafa. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=148.0s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were displaced again, deepening the humanitarian crisis. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=152.0s)]
*  By June, as its military pressed deeper into Gaza, calls grew inside Israel to rescue the nearly 100 remaining hostages. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=158.0s)]
*  Israeli forces on June 8 staged a complex daytime operation involving thousands of troops, technicians and analysts, and freed four hostages in central Gaza. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=165.0s)]
*  The raid killed more than 270 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=175.0s)]
*  So far, eight Israeli hostages have been rescued and the bodies of 36 hostages recovered. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=180.0s)]
*  Only a few dozen are still believed to be alive. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=185.0s)]
*  As fighting in southern Gaza intensified, so did attacks along the Israel-Lebanon border. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=190.0s)]
*  Israel for months had traded rocket fire with Hamas ally Hezbollah, an Iran-aligned militant group in Lebanon. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=196.0s)]
*  On September 27, an Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb killed Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=203.0s)]
*  Four days later, Israel kicked off a ground invasion into Lebanon. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=210.0s)]
*  In retaliation, Iran fired hundreds of missiles towards Israel. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=214.0s)]
*  Israel vowed to respond. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=218.0s)]
*  One year into the war, hopes of preventing the conflict from spreading across the region are fast-fading. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYREqmciRoU&t=220.0s)]
