# Hostage families in D.C. react to Israel-Hamas deal
**Washington Post - Israel Palestine:** [January 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Isb_5fCyv1w)
*  Bring them home! [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Isb_5fCyv1w&t=0.0s)]
*  We are here because the deal has started today. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Isb_5fCyv1w&t=3.0s)]
*  Three live hostages came back to Israel. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Isb_5fCyv1w&t=6.0s)]
*  But I'm here to remind everyone that with all the euphoria of live hostages coming back, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Isb_5fCyv1w&t=10.0s)]
*  there are still a second phase and a third one. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Isb_5fCyv1w&t=18.0s)]
*  I mean, it's been a very emotional day this morning, just following the news from Israel. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Isb_5fCyv1w&t=21.0s)]
*  And on the other hand, for us knowing that our son is not alive [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Isb_5fCyv1w&t=27.0s)]
*  and he will not be brought back to us in this first phase, it's tough. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Isb_5fCyv1w&t=32.0s)]
*  This is a humanitarian issue. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Isb_5fCyv1w&t=39.0s)]
*  These are innocent people that need to come home to their families. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Isb_5fCyv1w&t=41.0s)]
*  And we've seen that people from both sides, the Biden administration and the Trump administration, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Isb_5fCyv1w&t=45.0s)]
*  have come together, put in the work to make sure that this gets done. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Isb_5fCyv1w&t=50.0s)]
*  We believe that the Trump administration, starting tomorrow, will keep its finger on the situation [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Isb_5fCyv1w&t=53.0s)]
*  and make sure that everyone continues moving forward with the agreement until it is completed, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Isb_5fCyv1w&t=60.0s)]
*  hostages are home, and there's a durable ceasefire in Gaza that will create a better post-Khamas future, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Isb_5fCyv1w&t=66.0s)]
*  first and foremost for the people of Gaza, but also for the whole region. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Isb_5fCyv1w&t=73.0s)]
*  I need my loved ones back, and Israel needs to see the hostages back so we can heal and we can move forward. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Isb_5fCyv1w&t=77.0s)]
