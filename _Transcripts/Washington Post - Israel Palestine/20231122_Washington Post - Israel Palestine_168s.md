# Israel, Hamas agree to hostage deal, pause in fighting
**Washington Post - Israel Palestine:** [November 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M)
*  Israel and Hamas agreed on November 22nd to a hostage release deal that will see the first [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=0.0s)]
*  pause in fighting since October 7th when Hamas attacked Israel and Israel responded with [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=5.12s)]
*  a siege and bombardment on the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=10.0s)]
*  The deal includes a four-day pause in fighting and the release of at least 50 Israeli women [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=13.18s)]
*  and children being held captive in Gaza. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=17.44s)]
*  The deal also includes the release of 150 Palestinian women and teenagers from Israeli [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=20.5s)]
*  prisons as well as ramping up the entry of humanitarian aid trucks. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=24.96s)]
*  But the deal isn't a full ceasefire. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=29.76s)]
*  Instead, just a pause in the fighting, a clear distinction Israel and Washington have made [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=31.48s)]
*  since the war began. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=35.2s)]
*  More than 100 countries have called for a ceasefire to stop the steadily climbing death [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=36.800000000000004s)]
*  toll of civilians in Gaza and to allow desperately needed humanitarian aid to more freely pass [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  under the Strip. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=45.92s)]
*  But U.S. and Israeli officials have rejected these calls. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=46.92s)]
*  A ceasefire now would simply leave Hamas in place, able to regroup and repeat what it [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=50.8s)]
*  did on October 7th. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=60.44s)]
*  Washington instead backs a shorter humanitarian pause. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=62.16s)]
*  The ceasefire implies some level of permanency and a humanitarian pause is a pause. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  It's a pause for a variety of purposes. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=70.12s)]
*  It can be about getting hostages out and humanitarian assistance in into non-compatents. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=72.4s)]
*  But after that's over, the conflict will continue. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=77.36s)]
*  When you say pause, you have to ask, is it the entire force? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=80.08s)]
*  Is it part of the force? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=83.16s)]
*  Is it across the entire conflict zone or is it in some areas? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=84.16s)]
*  The U.S. rejecting a full ceasefire has been met with protests across the world. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=88.28s)]
*  Israel has said it's open to tactical pauses, but said no to stopping its fighting outright [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=93.56s)]
*  unless all of the estimated 240 hostages are released. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=97.84s)]
*  As Israel expands its military operation deeper into Gaza, the U.S. has more and more begun [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=102.48s)]
*  to note its concern for civilian deaths. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=107.36s)]
*  As they continue to look at expanded military operations or ground operations in other ways [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=110.36s)]
*  in other parts of Gaza, they need to ensure that they're safe, that they're humanitarian [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=115.48s)]
*  corridors for civilians. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=121.68s)]
*  There's protection for civilians. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=123.88s)]
*  And we think that their operation should not go forward until those people, those additional [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=125.32s)]
*  civilians have been accounted for in their military planning. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=130.6s)]
*  The restraints on Israeli conduct in the past five weeks have been mainly self-imposed. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=134.56s)]
*  Not much from the outside, not much from Washington. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=143.8s)]
*  Now, we have seen that changing in the past 10 days, where there was this push for pauses [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  on a daily basis. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=153.44s)]
*  But as border crossings remain closed and Gaza is still restricted from returning to [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=155.04s)]
*  the north, they now hunker down and can only brace for the fighting to return. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go-YsINs56M&t=159.04s)]
