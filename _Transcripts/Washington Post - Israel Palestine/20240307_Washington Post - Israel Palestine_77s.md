# U.S. quietly approved more than 100 military sales to Israel
**Washington Post - Israel Palestine:** [March 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LjE97pH3-0)
*  The United States has quietly approved and delivered more than 100 separate foreign military [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LjE97pH3-0&t=0.0s)]
*  sales to Israel since October 7. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LjE97pH3-0&t=4.96s)]
*  That includes thousands of munitions, small diameter bombs, buster bunkers, small arms, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LjE97pH3-0&t=7.96s)]
*  and other types of lethal aid. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LjE97pH3-0&t=14.86s)]
*  A key way that the sales avoided public scrutiny is because each individual sale of the 100 [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LjE97pH3-0&t=16.72s)]
*  fall below a monetary threshold that would require the executive branch to submit the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LjE97pH3-0&t=23.56s)]
*  notification to Congress. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LjE97pH3-0&t=31.04s)]
*  U.S. arms sales to Israel have come under the microscope because the war in Gaza has [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LjE97pH3-0&t=32.839999999999996s)]
*  created such an enormous civilian death toll. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LjE97pH3-0&t=38.019999999999996s)]
*  There's a lack of food, water, and medicine. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LjE97pH3-0&t=41.0s)]
*  The vast majority of Israel's arsenal is from the United States. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LjE97pH3-0&t=43.66s)]
*  The Biden administration has been under pressure to use U.S. military assistance as a leverage [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LjE97pH3-0&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  to get some of the things that it wants out of the Israelis, whether that is more aid [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LjE97pH3-0&t=53.32s)]
*  going into Gaza or to lower the tempo of their military campaign. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LjE97pH3-0&t=57.56s)]
*  What our reporting shows is that there has been actually a steady influx of military [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LjE97pH3-0&t=62.56s)]
*  assistance even while at the same time the United States has publicly expressed strong [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LjE97pH3-0&t=67.04s)]
*  reservations about the way that Israel is conducting the war. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LjE97pH3-0&t=71.88s)]
