# Blinken: Israel attacks on aid workers 'must be the last'
**Washington Post - Israel Palestine:** [April 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlsA8ntzjA8)
*  This week's horrific attack on the World Central Kitchen was not the first such incident. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlsA8ntzjA8&t=0.0s)]
*  It must be the last. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlsA8ntzjA8&t=7.74s)]
*  President Biden spoke a short while ago with Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlsA8ntzjA8&t=11.36s)]
*  The leaders discussed the situation in Gaza. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlsA8ntzjA8&t=15.26s)]
*  The President emphasized that the strikes on humanitarian workers and the overall humanitarian [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlsA8ntzjA8&t=18.88s)]
*  situation are unacceptable. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlsA8ntzjA8&t=23.92s)]
*  He made clear the need for Israel to announce a series of specific, concrete, and measurable [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlsA8ntzjA8&t=27.38s)]
*  steps to address civilian harm, humanitarian suffering, and the safety of aid workers. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlsA8ntzjA8&t=34.5s)]
*  He made clear that U.S. policy with respect to Gaza will be determined by our assessment [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlsA8ntzjA8&t=41.98s)]
*  of Israel's immediate action on these steps. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlsA8ntzjA8&t=47.64s)]
*  When I saw the news of the strike, I was outraged and I strongly condemn it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlsA8ntzjA8&t=52.08s)]
*  When I spoke to it the other day, others of my colleagues had been out. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlsA8ntzjA8&t=60.72s)]
*  I was focused on the people, the individuals who had lost their lives, given their lives, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlsA8ntzjA8&t=65.7s)]
*  in service of their fellow human beings. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlsA8ntzjA8&t=76.2s)]
*  That was what was motivating me in those initial comments, because it's so important that [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlsA8ntzjA8&t=78.1s)]
*  the world understands these are heroes. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlsA8ntzjA8&t=86.02s)]
*  What these men and women did, the ones who lost their lives in Gaza, as well as people [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlsA8ntzjA8&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  working for World Central Kitchen around the world in so many places of conflict, is extraordinary [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlsA8ntzjA8&t=98.24s)]
*  and the best of humanity. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlsA8ntzjA8&t=103.46s)]
*  I thought it was important as well to put the focus on that, even as the administration [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlsA8ntzjA8&t=104.68s)]
*  spoke clearly about our outrage and our condemnation. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlsA8ntzjA8&t=108.86000000000001s)]
