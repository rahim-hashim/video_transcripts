*  The only real and sustainable solution to this decades-old conflict is a negotiated [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjUlFcKHl9g&t=44.24s)]
*  two-state solution, a demilitarized Palestinian state living side by side with Israel in equal [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjUlFcKHl9g&t=50.32s)]
*  measures of peace, security, prosperity, dignity, and mutual recognition. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjUlFcKHl9g&t=57.400000000000006s)]
