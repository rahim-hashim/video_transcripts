*  The brutality of Hamas, these bloodthirstiness brings to mind the worst, the worst rampages [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W12V-qxzoec&t=0.0s)]
*  of ISIS. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W12V-qxzoec&t=8.72s)]
*  This is terrorism. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W12V-qxzoec&t=10.68s)]
*  But sadly, for the Jewish people, it's not new. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W12V-qxzoec&t=13.0s)]

*  The state of purpose is the annihilation of the State of Israel on the murder of Jewish [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W12V-qxzoec&t=33.12s)]
*  people. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W12V-qxzoec&t=36.36s)]
*  Israel has the right to respond, indeed has a duty to respond to these vicious attacks. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W12V-qxzoec&t=37.36s)]
*  I just got off the phone with a third call with Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W12V-qxzoec&t=44.28s)]
*  I told him, the United States experience with Israel is experiencing our response to be [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W12V-qxzoec&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  swift, decisive, and overwhelming. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W12V-qxzoec&t=54.72s)]
*  We're surging additional military assistance, including ammunition and interceptors, to [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W12V-qxzoec&t=57.6s)]
*  replenish Iron Dome. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W12V-qxzoec&t=62.0s)]

*  its cities and its citizens. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W12V-qxzoec&t=69.8s)]
*  When Congress returns, we're going to ask them to take urgent action to fund the national [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W12V-qxzoec&t=71.64s)]
*  security requirements of our critical partners. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W12V-qxzoec&t=77.32s)]
*  This is not about party or politics. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W12V-qxzoec&t=80.68s)]
*  This is about the security of our world. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W12V-qxzoec&t=84.36s)]

*  the United States government to consult with and advise Israeli counterparts on hostage [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W12V-qxzoec&t=97.96s)]
*  recovery efforts. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W12V-qxzoec&t=104.16s)]
*  Yesterday, I also spoke with the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, and UK to discuss [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W12V-qxzoec&t=105.44s)]
*  the latest developments with our European allies and coordinate our United response. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W12V-qxzoec&t=111.76s)]
*  This comes on top of days of steady engagement with partners across the region. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W12V-qxzoec&t=118.44000000000001s)]
*  For 75 years, Israel has stood as the only guarantor of the security of Jewish people [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W12V-qxzoec&t=123.28s)]
*  around the world so that atrocities of the past could never happen again. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W12V-qxzoec&t=129.96s)]

*  as we always have. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W12V-qxzoec&t=146.52s)]
*  It's as simple as that. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W12V-qxzoec&t=147.52s)]
*  These atrocities have been sickening. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W12V-qxzoec&t=150.04000000000002s)]
*  First, we're with Israel. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W12V-qxzoec&t=154.44s)]
*  Let's make no mistake. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W12V-qxzoec&t=157.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W12V-qxzoec&t=158.24s)]
