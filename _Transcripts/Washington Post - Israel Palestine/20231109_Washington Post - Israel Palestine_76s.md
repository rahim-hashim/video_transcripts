# Democrats in House call for cease-fire
**Washington Post - Israel Palestine:** [November 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu_AWI0Mp1E)
*  Since Hamas murdered 1,400 innocent Israelis one month ago, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu_AWI0Mp1E&t=0.0s)]
*  nobody has questioned that Hamas must be held accountable. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu_AWI0Mp1E&t=6.140000000000001s)]
*  But let's be clear, it is innocent Palestinian civilians [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu_AWI0Mp1E&t=10.34s)]
*  that are paying the price for crimes that they did not commit. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu_AWI0Mp1E&t=14.780000000000001s)]
*  A humanitarian pause, yes, it is a one-sided, it is a unilateral decision. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu_AWI0Mp1E&t=18.86s)]
*  But when you have the world saying we wanna cease fire, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu_AWI0Mp1E&t=27.72s)]
*  when we have the people that actually are the ones that will go and [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu_AWI0Mp1E&t=32.12s)]
*  be on the ground, that would have to be the ones to carry out, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu_AWI0Mp1E&t=35.48s)]
*  the ones that did carry out, that are saying no, no, no, that's not the way. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu_AWI0Mp1E&t=39.12s)]
*  No, four hours, we don't want four hours, we don't want 16 hours, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu_AWI0Mp1E&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  we don't want 22, we want a ceasefire now. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu_AWI0Mp1E&t=50.2s)]
*  Like it or not, we must acknowledge that we have a choice in this moment. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu_AWI0Mp1E&t=53.839999999999996s)]
*  And I am proud and honored to join my colleagues, human rights advocates, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu_AWI0Mp1E&t=60.199999999999996s)]
*  veterans, and the whole world who is calling in this [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu_AWI0Mp1E&t=65.16s)]
*  precise moment for us to cease fire now. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu_AWI0Mp1E&t=71.6s)]
