# Netanyahu says Iran would bring a ‘dark future of despair’
**Washington Post - Israel Palestine:** [September 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhAMDJmDwWQ)
*  Iran's malignant arc has shut down international waterways. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhAMDJmDwWQ&t=0.0s)]
*  It cuts off trade. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhAMDJmDwWQ&t=5.8s)]
*  It destroys millions, destroys nations from within, and inflicts misery on millions. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhAMDJmDwWQ&t=7.44s)]
*  On the one hand, a bright blessing, a future of hope. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhAMDJmDwWQ&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  On the other hand, a dark future of despair. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhAMDJmDwWQ&t=23.02s)]
*  And if you think this dark map is only a curse for Israel, if you think that, then you should think again. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhAMDJmDwWQ&t=27.0s)]
*  Just this week, the IDF destroyed large percentages of Hezbollah's rockets, which had built with [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhAMDJmDwWQ&t=33.76s)]
*  Iran's funding for three decades. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhAMDJmDwWQ&t=40.16s)]
*  We took out senior military commanders who not only shed Israeli blood, but American [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhAMDJmDwWQ&t=42.6s)]
*  and French blood as well. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhAMDJmDwWQ&t=47.92s)]
*  And then we took out their replacements, and then the replacements of their replacements. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhAMDJmDwWQ&t=50.56s)]
*  And we'll continue degrading Hezbollah until all our objectives are made. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhAMDJmDwWQ&t=56.12s)]
*  All the hostility directed at Israel this year, it's not about Gaza. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhAMDJmDwWQ&t=63.08s)]
*  It's about Israel. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhAMDJmDwWQ&t=68.75999999999999s)]
*  It's always been about Israel. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhAMDJmDwWQ&t=70.8s)]
*  About Israel's very existence. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhAMDJmDwWQ&t=73.52s)]
*  And I say to you, until Israel, until the Jewish state is treated like other nations, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhAMDJmDwWQ&t=77.5s)]
*  until this anti-Semitic swamp is drained, the UN will be viewed by fair-minded people [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhAMDJmDwWQ&t=83.6s)]
*  everywhere as nothing more than a contemptuous farce. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhAMDJmDwWQ&t=89.11999999999999s)]
