*  Ceasefire what specifically are you requesting of the US? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNl7w7302NE&t=6.08s)]
*  Going forward to secure the release of your loved ones and as it relates to the desire for another ceasefire right now [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNl7w7302NE&t=10.14s)]
*  Is there any more information that you learned about the potential that that could happen? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNl7w7302NE&t=16.22s)]
*  Anytime soon well as I said before we're gonna keep the private conversations private what we do know what we do know and we've seen [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNl7w7302NE&t=20.740000000000002s)]
*  that the US administration from the previous round of [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNl7w7302NE&t=28.12s)]
*  negotiations and hostage release the US administration is completely committed to [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNl7w7302NE&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  Getting the hostages out the eight Americans who remain there and the other [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNl7w7302NE&t=37.44s)]
*  Nearly 130 we have no doubt about that and today's [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNl7w7302NE&t=43.160000000000004s)]
*  Today's meeting with President Biden and Secretary Blinken only reinforced that and that they are [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNl7w7302NE&t=48.32000000000001s)]
*  Willing and ready to do all that they possibly can by any number of means to get the hostages home [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNl7w7302NE&t=54.92s)]
*  And also not one second and also not just to talk about them as hostages [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNl7w7302NE&t=60.92s)]
*  But to talk about them as people and that is what the president and Secretary Blinken [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNl7w7302NE&t=65.28s)]
*  Understand is that they're just not numbers and they're just not faces. They are sons. They are sons [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNl7w7302NE&t=71.12s)]
*  They are grandparents. They are mothers and that is what the president and his team [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNl7w7302NE&t=77.4s)]
*  Understand and this is our last question [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNl7w7302NE&t=83.16s)]
*  So I'm just gonna answer by saying we appreciate we are thankful to the president and to his team [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNl7w7302NE&t=84.88s)]
*  Because we know that they are working [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNl7w7302NE&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  24 hours a day and they are going to work through the holidays and they are going to do everything they can to make sure that [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNl7w7302NE&t=93.64s)]
