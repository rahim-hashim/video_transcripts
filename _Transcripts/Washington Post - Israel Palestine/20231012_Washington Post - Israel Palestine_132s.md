# What is Hamas? The Palestinian militant group, explained
**Washington Post - Israel Palestine:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kra5MKG3KEM)
*  A surprise invasion starting from Gaza on October 7th overtook southern Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kra5MKG3KEM&t=0.0s)]
*  The coordinated assault, including the kidnapping and killing of dozens of civilians, seemed [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kra5MKG3KEM&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  to catch Israeli security forces off guard. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kra5MKG3KEM&t=11.14s)]
*  Israel has since pounded the Gaza Strip with retaliatory strikes, and is now talking of [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kra5MKG3KEM&t=14.4s)]
*  a massive ground assault. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kra5MKG3KEM&t=18.900000000000002s)]
*  The invasion was led by Hamas. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kra5MKG3KEM&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  Known as the Islamic Resistance Movement, the group governs the Gaza Strip, a 25-mile-long, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kra5MKG3KEM&t=23.8s)]
*  densely populated area with more than 2.1 million Palestinians. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kra5MKG3KEM&t=29.16s)]
*  Hamas does not recognize the existence of Israel. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kra5MKG3KEM&t=33.64s)]
*  The group is committed to establishing a Palestinian state stretching from the Mediterranean Sea [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kra5MKG3KEM&t=36.9s)]
*  to the Jordan River. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kra5MKG3KEM&t=40.96s)]
*  Hamas is not fighting for there to be a Palestinian state alongside an Israeli state. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kra5MKG3KEM&t=42.68s)]
*  Hamas is fighting to destroy Israel and to have one Palestinian state that is not secular [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kra5MKG3KEM&t=47.84s)]
*  but is Islamist in all of historic Palestine, in all of Israel, in all of the West Bank, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kra5MKG3KEM&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  in all of the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kra5MKG3KEM&t=58.36s)]
*  Hamas emerged as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood during the first Palestinian Intifada [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kra5MKG3KEM&t=60.04s)]
*  in 1987 against the Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kra5MKG3KEM&t=64.2s)]
*  The group is not to be confused with Fatah, the Palestinian party that controls the West [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kra5MKG3KEM&t=69.28s)]
*  Bank. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kra5MKG3KEM&t=72.92s)]
*  In fact, the groups for years have been embroiled in a bitter political conflict. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kra5MKG3KEM&t=73.92s)]
*  Hamas defeated Fatah in Gaza's elections in 2006 and seized full control of the Strip [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kra5MKG3KEM&t=78.36s)]
*  one year later. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kra5MKG3KEM&t=83.32s)]
*  Since then, Hamas has repeatedly attacked Israel from Gaza with rockets, mortars and [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kra5MKG3KEM&t=84.92s)]
*  kidnappings. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kra5MKG3KEM&t=89.0s)]
*  Israel has retaliated with firepower and the tightening of its already punishing blockade, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kra5MKG3KEM&t=90.68s)]
*  restricting imports and the movement of civilians. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kra5MKG3KEM&t=95.76s)]
*  The US in 1997 designated Hamas as a terrorist organization. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kra5MKG3KEM&t=98.16s)]
*  They have repeatedly shown that they do not support the peace process and use terrorism [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kra5MKG3KEM&t=102.36s)]
*  to destroy it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kra5MKG3KEM&t=107.64s)]
*  Saturday's assault by Hamas comes after many years of worsening tensions between Palestinians [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kra5MKG3KEM&t=109.12s)]
*  and Israel, fueled by a tightening Israeli blockade of Gaza, an intensifying occupation [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kra5MKG3KEM&t=113.44s)]
*  of the West Bank, a regular barrage of rocket fire into Israel, violence at Muslim and Jewish [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kra5MKG3KEM&t=118.32s)]
*  holy sites and the swelling number of evictions of Palestinian families from their homes. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kra5MKG3KEM&t=123.28s)]
