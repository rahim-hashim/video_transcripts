# Blinken: 'The United States has Israel's back'
**Washington Post - Israel Palestine:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k)
*  The message that I bring to Israel is this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k&t=0.0s)]
*  You may be strong enough on your own to defend yourself, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k&t=3.52s)]
*  but as long as America exists, you will never ever have to. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k&t=6.68s)]
*  We will always be there by your side. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k&t=11.88s)]
*  That's the message that President Biden delivered [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k&t=16.36s)]
*  to the Prime Minister from the moment this crisis began. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k&t=19.0s)]
*  It's the message that I and my other colleagues [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k&t=23.96s)]
*  in the government have delivered to our Israeli counterparts. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k&t=26.64s)]
*  On a daily, even an hourly basis. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k&t=30.0s)]
*  It's the message that I bring with me to our discussions today, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k&t=33.52s)]
*  and it's what I'll affirm when I meet with the members [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k&t=37.44s)]
*  of Israel's newly formed national emergency government. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  You heard the Prime Minister say it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k&t=42.8s)]
*  This is, this must be a moment for moral clarity. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k&t=44.88s)]
*  The failure to unambiguously condemn terrorism [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k&t=51.08s)]
*  puts at risk not only people in Israel, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k&t=54.08s)]
*  but people everywhere. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k&t=57.16s)]
*  We're delivering on our word, supplying ammunition, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k&t=58.919999999999995s)]
*  interceptors to replenish Israel's Iron Dome [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k&t=62.12s)]
*  alongside other defense material. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k&t=65.6s)]
*  First shipments of U.S. military support [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k&t=68.32s)]
*  have already arrived in Israel, and more is on the way. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k&t=70.24s)]
*  As Israel's defense needs evolve, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k&t=75.64s)]
*  we will work with Congress to make sure that they're met. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k&t=77.67999999999999s)]
*  And I can tell you, there is overwhelming, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k&t=80.47999999999999s)]
*  overwhelming bipartisan support in our Congress [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k&t=83.36s)]
*  for Israel's security. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k&t=86.04s)]
*  Here in Israel and everywhere, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k&t=88.44000000000001s)]
*  we will reaffirm the crystal clear warning [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k&t=91.84s)]
*  that President Biden issued yesterday to any adversary, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  state or non-state, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k&t=98.08000000000001s)]
*  thinking of taking advantage of the current crisis [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k&t=100.60000000000001s)]
*  to attack Israel. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k&t=102.44s)]
*  Don't. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  The United States has Israel's back. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVMDHUD_4k&t=105.64000000000001s)]
