# Why is the population in the Gaza Strip so young?
**Washington Post - Israel Palestine:** [December 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul1Szlr7kig)
*  The population in Gaza is among the youngest in the world. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul1Szlr7kig&t=0.0s)]
*  Of the more than 2 million people that live in this small stretch of land, nearly half [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul1Szlr7kig&t=4.32s)]
*  far under the age of 18, according to the United Nations. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul1Szlr7kig&t=7.88s)]
*  This means many of the civilians facing Israeli airstrikes, embracing for an anticipated ground [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul1Szlr7kig&t=11.52s)]
*  evasion are children. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul1Szlr7kig&t=15.36s)]
*  One reason the area has such a young population is that Gazans tend to marry in their early [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul1Szlr7kig&t=18.04s)]
*  twenties and have larger families. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul1Szlr7kig&t=21.76s)]
*  But even before the war, children were born into a depleted healthcare system and access [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul1Szlr7kig&t=23.72s)]
*  to critical medical treatment as you grew older became more difficult. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul1Szlr7kig&t=28.22s)]
*  Israel's 16-year blockade of the Strip, imposed after Hamas' control of the enclave in 2007, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul1Szlr7kig&t=32.14s)]
*  controls everything that goes in and out, from auto parts and appliances to fishing [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul1Szlr7kig&t=37.42s)]
*  boats and soccer teams to food and medicine. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul1Szlr7kig&t=41.82s)]
*  And Egypt, which borders Gaza to the south, also supports the blockade. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul1Szlr7kig&t=45.42s)]
*  This blockade has contributed to Gaza's medical shortfalls, where IVs and gauze are hard to [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul1Szlr7kig&t=49.3s)]
*  come by as is access to critical care. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul1Szlr7kig&t=53.66s)]
*  To leave the Strip for more advanced treatment, residents must apply for a permit that's [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul1Szlr7kig&t=56.86s)]
*  notoriously difficult to obtain. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul1Szlr7kig&t=60.64s)]
*  This has led to a plummeting life expectancy. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul1Szlr7kig&t=62.86s)]
*  The average life expectancy in the Gaza Strip is about 75 years old. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul1Szlr7kig&t=65.26s)]
*  Meanwhile, in places like the United States and Israel, it's much higher. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul1Szlr7kig&t=69.18s)]
*  Gaza's young population now faces regular airstrikes and targeted military raids, and [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul1Szlr7kig&t=73.9s)]
*  some teenagers are already living through their fifth war. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul1Szlr7kig&t=79.62s)]
*  A study in 2021, following an Israeli military attack, found that nine out of ten children [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul1Szlr7kig&t=83.3s)]
*  in Gaza suffered conflict-related trauma. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul1Szlr7kig&t=88.25999999999999s)]
*  Hundreds of these children have lost one or both parents, and many more face permanent [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul1Szlr7kig&t=91.7s)]
*  and long-term disabilities. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul1Szlr7kig&t=96.25999999999999s)]
