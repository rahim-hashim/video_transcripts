# Blinken outlines benefits of a humanitarian pause in Gaza
**Washington Post - Israel Palestine:** [November 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4)
*  Yesterday, President Joe Biden went and asked whether he was optimistic and felt progress [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4&t=0.0s)]
*  was being made towards getting Israel to agree to humanitarian policies and strikes. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  He gave a thumbs up and said yes. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4&t=11.8s)]
*  Based on your conversations with Israel on Friday, with Arab leaders yesterday and today, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4&t=14.56s)]
*  do you share the President's optimism? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4&t=19.64s)]
*  Why hasn't a deal been agreed to yet? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4&t=22.32s)]
*  How do you get around Israel's apparent categorical rejection of any kind of a deal like this, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4&t=24.56s)]
*  a deal that many people seem to think is a modest step? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4&t=31.24s)]
*  Well, first, as we said following my conversations with the Prime Minister and with the Israeli [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4&t=35.4s)]
*  government, this is a process. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4&t=41.16s)]
*  Israel's raised important questions about how humanitarian pauses would work. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4&t=44.0s)]
*  We've got to answer those questions. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4&t=50.08s)]
*  We're working on exactly that. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  In fact, we agreed that our teams would get together and they're doing just that. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4&t=52.72s)]
*  It's important that the pause advance a number of things. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4&t=57.16s)]
*  One of them is hostages. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  We are intensely focused. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  The United States, Israel, every other country that has one of its citizens being held hostage [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4&t=67.52s)]
*  by Hamas to bring them home. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4&t=72.64s)]
*  Now, it's important that as we're engaged in pursuing humanitarian pause, this can be [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4&t=75.72s)]
*  something that advances the prospect of getting the hostages back. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4&t=81.68s)]
*  It can also advance other things that we're committed to doing, as is the government of [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4&t=85.0s)]
*  Israel and other partners in the region, especially getting more humanitarian assistance to people [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4&t=90.04s)]
*  who need it in Gaza. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4&t=94.92s)]
*  I'll remind you, when we had conversations three weeks ago about starting humanitarian [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4&t=97.8s)]
*  assistance, it was a process to actually get that moving. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4&t=103.68s)]
*  But we had a commitment to do that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4&t=107.28s)]
*  It took some days to get the process in place. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4&t=109.44000000000001s)]
*  Since then, we've had trucks moving. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4&t=112.16000000000001s)]
*  We have about 100 trucks a day going in. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4&t=113.48s)]
*  That's good, but it's grossly insufficient. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4&t=115.76s)]
*  So now we're working on raising that significantly so that more aid in a sustained way gets into [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4&t=118.08000000000001s)]
*  Palestinians who need it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4&t=125.16000000000001s)]
*  There again, humanitarian pause can also help advance that and create an environment in [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4&t=126.64000000000001s)]
*  which we can do as much as possible for people who so desperately need the assistance. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grjWlqYa6L4&t=131.36s)]
