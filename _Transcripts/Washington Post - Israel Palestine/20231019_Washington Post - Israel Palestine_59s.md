# 'I will never leave my home': Israeli family stays in Sderot
**Washington Post - Israel Palestine:** [October 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dwOkLET9M)
*  We got a text message that says that we have to evacuate our home for our own safety. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dwOkLET9M&t=0.0s)]
*  We decided to stay. I will not leave my home. I feel here more safe than any other place. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dwOkLET9M&t=8.0s)]
*  I'm really terrified to go outside, even to throw garbage. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dwOkLET9M&t=16.0s)]
*  We ran immediately to our house. We told the kids to be silent. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dwOkLET9M&t=30.0s)]
*  The only thing that will make us leave when we're healed and knock on the door from the army. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dwOkLET9M&t=42.0s)]
*  Before all of this, our door were always open. Like, open. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dwOkLET9M&t=49.0s)]
*  That's the only thing that I think that will stay with us for a long time. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dwOkLET9M&t=54.0s)]
