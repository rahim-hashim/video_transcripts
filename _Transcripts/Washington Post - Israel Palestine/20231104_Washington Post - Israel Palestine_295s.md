# How the Palestinian ‘Nakba’ relates to the Israel-Gaza war
**Washington Post - Israel Palestine:** [November 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ)
*  For many Palestinians, the devastation of the unfolding Israel-Gaza war is reminiscent of a painful time in their history, known as the Nakba. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=0.0s)]
*  The Nakba is the Palestinian catastrophe. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=9.6s)]
*  It is the series of events that led to the destruction of Palestinian society in 1948. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=13.52s)]
*  Let's back up a little. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=21.12s)]
*  At the turn of the 20th century, Palestine was overwhelmingly Muslim with a significant Christian and Jewish minority. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=23.599999999999998s)]
*  In 1917, Britain announced its support for the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people and took control of Palestine shortly after. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=31.36s)]
*  The crux of this entire conflict is that how do you establish a Jewish majority state in a land overwhelmingly populated by Palestinian Arabs who do not identify as Jewish? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=40.48s)]
*  First pictures permitted of Jewish refugees on their way from Cyprus to Palestine. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=54.64s)]
*  Over the next three decades, hundreds of thousands of Jewish people immigrated to Palestine to escape the Holocaust and persecution in Europe. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=60.08s)]
*  After World War II, tensions in Palestine grew. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=68.64s)]
*  With the intention of pulling out, Britain turned the problem over to someone else. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=72.16s)]
*  The newly established United Nations. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=77.28s)]
*  And flushing Long Island, the General Assembly of the United Nations has made its decision on Palestine. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=80.16s)]
*  In 1947, the UN voted to partition Palestine into two states, one Arab and one Jewish, allocating a larger portion of the land to the Jewish minority. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=85.84s)]
*  How was that going to work? This was this was clearly an unworkable and disastrous proposal. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=96.88s)]
*  Following the partition vote, violent conflict between the two groups continued. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=103.28s)]
*  The British were instrumental. The very small Jewish community in Palestine, they helped it grow. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=108.08s)]
*  They helped it institutionalize itself. They helped it in the formation of paramilitary groups. They helped train them and arm them. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=114.96s)]
*  In the spring of 1948, the Jewish paramilitary began executing a plan to secure a Jewish majority state. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=121.92s)]
*  So Palestinians were either driven out by force, in some cases a gunpoint, or in other times they fled for their lives for fear that they will be massacred. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=129.76s)]
*  There's a new Jewish state is born. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=142.8s)]
*  In May 1948, Israel declared independence and the Arab-Israeli War began with several neighboring Arab countries resisting the formation of the new state. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=145.6s)]
*  Women flee with what belongings they can carry. And as Palestine struggles for national existence, the conflict catches the inevitable innocent in its soil. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=156.48s)]
*  By the end of the war, Israel had expanded its boundaries to 78 percent of what had previously been Palestine. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=166.32s)]
*  More than 700,000 Palestinians were displaced from their homes and hundreds of their villages were destroyed. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=174.88s)]
*  I mean, for Israelis, they call it a day of independence. It's the creation of a new state that was the realization of a long-held dream. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=181.76s)]
*  After 2,000 years, a Jewish nation once again exists. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=192.88s)]
*  For Palestinians, it is the destruction of their society. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=196.72s)]
*  It is the hell from which they have never recovered yet. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=203.12s)]
*  The following decades brought several wars and uprisings. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=206.24s)]
*  To this day, Israel refuses to allow Palestinian refugees to return home, making them one of the largest stateless populations in the world. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  In Gaza and the West Bank, Palestinians are kept under constant surveillance and harsh socioeconomic conditions. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=221.44s)]
*  In October 2023, Israel declared war following a large-scale assault by Hamas militants that left 1,400 dead. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=228.72s)]
*  In the first three weeks of the war, at least 9,200 people in Gaza had been killed in retaliatory Israeli attacks. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=241.92s)]
*  For many Palestinians in Gaza today, the Nakba continues. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=250.96s)]
*  Being faced with the choice of leaving your home behind, even your temporary interim home in the refugee camp, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=256.32s)]
*  leaving that behind or getting killed is exactly the choice that our parents and grandparents faced in 1948. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMN2NqAPMpQ&t=265.28000000000003s)]
