# Tlaib calls for Gaza cease-fire in impassioned speech
**Washington Post - Israel Palestine:** [November 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08)
*  I'm the only Palestinian-American serving in Congress, Mr. Chair, and my perspective [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=0.0s)]
*  is needed here now more than ever. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=4.3s)]
*  I will not be silenced, and I will not let you distort my words. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=7.28s)]
*  Folks forget I'm from the city of Detroit, the most beautiful, blackest city in the country [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=12.34s)]
*  where I learned to speak truth to power even if my voice shakes. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=15.860000000000001s)]
*  Trying to bully or censor me won't work because this movement for a ceasefire is much bigger [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=20.26s)]
*  than one person. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=26.68s)]
*  It's growing every single day. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=28.06s)]
*  There are millions of people across our country who oppose Netanyahu's extremism and are done [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=30.38s)]
*  watching our government support collective punishment and the use of white phosphorus [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=35.68s)]
*  bombs that melt flesh to the bone. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=39.54s)]
*  They are done watching our government, Mr. Chair, supporting cutting off food, water, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=41.78s)]
*  electricity, and medical care to millions of people with nowhere to go. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=45.82s)]
*  Like me, Mr. Chair, they don't believe the answer to war crimes is more war crimes. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=50.34s)]
*  The refusal of Congress and the administration to acknowledge Palestinian lives is chipping [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=55.44s)]
*  that way at my soul. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  Over 10,000 Palestinians have been killed. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=61.36s)]
*  Majority, majority were children. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  But let me be clear. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=67.36s)]
*  My criticism has always been of the Israeli government and Netanyahu's actions. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  It is important to separate people and governments, Mr. Chair. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=74.2s)]
*  No government is beyond criticism. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=77.2s)]
*  The idea that criticizing the government of Israel is anti-Semitic sets a very dangerous [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=79.82s)]
*  precedent and it's being used to silence diverse voices speaking up for human rights across [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=84.52000000000001s)]
*  our nation. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=89.12s)]
*  Do you realize what it's like, Mr. Chair, for the people outside the chamber right now [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=90.86s)]
*  listening in agony to their own government dehumanizing them? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=95.54s)]
*  To hear the President of the United States, we help the elect dispute death tolls as we [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=99.30000000000001s)]
*  see video after video of dead children and parents under rubble. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=103.48s)]
*  Mr. Chair, do you know what it's like to fear rising hate crimes, to know how Islamophobia [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=107.4s)]
*  and anti-Semitism makes us all less safe and worry that your own child might suffer [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=112.08s)]
*  the horrors that six-year-old Wadiya did in Illinois? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=117.16s)]
*  I can't believe I have to say this, but Palestinian people are not disposable. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  We are human beings. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=142.04s)]
*  Just like anyone else, my city, my grandmother, like all Palestinians, just wants to live [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=146.39999999999998s)]
*  her life with freedom and human dignity we all deserve. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=154.79999999999998s)]
*  Speaking up to save lives, Mr. Chair, no matter faith, no matter ethnicity, should not be [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=160.35999999999999s)]
*  controversial in this chamber. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=165.12s)]
*  The cries of the Palestinian and Israeli children sound no different to me. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=167.28s)]
*  Why what I don't understand is why the cries of Palestinians sound different to you all. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=173.04s)]
*  We cannot lose our shared humanity, Mr. Chair. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=182.2s)]
*  I hear the voices of advocates in Israel, in Palestine, across America, and around the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=185.6s)]
*  world for peace. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  I am inspired by the courageous survivors in Israel who have lost loved ones, yet are [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=193.36s)]
*  calling for a ceasefire and the end to violence. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=199.52s)]
*  I am grateful to the people in the streets for the peace movement with countless Jewish [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=202.72s)]
*  Americans across the country standing up and lovingly saying, not in our name. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=209.28s)]
*  We will continue to call for a ceasefire, Mr. Chair, for the immediate delivery of critical [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=217.04s)]
*  humanitarian aid to Gaza, for the release of all hostages and those arbitrarily detained, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=221.0s)]
*  and for every American to come home. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=226.28s)]
*  We will continue to work for a real lasting peace that upholds human rights and dignity [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=228.84s)]
*  of all people, and centers and peaceful coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians, and censures [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=232.84s)]
*  no one, no one, and ensures that no person, no child has to suffer a live in fear of violence. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=239.2s)]
*  71% of Michigan Democrats support a ceasefire, so you can try to censor me, but you can't [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=247.52s)]
*  silence their voices. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=254.64s)]
*  I urge my colleagues to join with the majority of Americans and support a ceasefire now to [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=256.64s)]
*  save as many lives as possible. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=261.32s)]
*  President Biden must listen to and represent all of us, not just some of us. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=264.32s)]
*  I urge the President to have the courage to call for a ceasefire and the end of killings. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=269.44s)]
*  Thank you and I yield. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jN45BbZh08&t=274.88s)]
