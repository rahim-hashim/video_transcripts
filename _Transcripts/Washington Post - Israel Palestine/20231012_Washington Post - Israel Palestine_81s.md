# ‘I just want them back’: Israeli family missing after attack
**Washington Post - Israel Palestine:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-PDTe5U11c)
*  In the video I see Erez. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-PDTe5U11c&t=0.0s)]
*  Erez, my younger brother, who was with my sister and my father. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-PDTe5U11c&t=2.0s)]
*  And I see that they're kicking him. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-PDTe5U11c&t=8.0s)]
*  And he's like screaming a little bit because he's hurting. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-PDTe5U11c&t=12.0s)]
*  I recognized the place. It was next to my father's house. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-PDTe5U11c&t=18.0s)]
*  It was so hard to watch. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-PDTe5U11c&t=22.0s)]
*  And then I see in the family chat, she's writing, Mom, I love you. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-PDTe5U11c&t=31.0s)]
*  So I knew it's probably because she knows it's the end or something. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-PDTe5U11c&t=37.0s)]
*  And it's my 16-year-old sister. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-PDTe5U11c&t=42.0s)]
*  I used to protect her all my life. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-PDTe5U11c&t=46.0s)]
*  She was together with my brother, Erez, and my father. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-PDTe5U11c&t=49.0s)]
*  Father, sister, and brother together in the momad. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-PDTe5U11c&t=56.0s)]
*  And my grandma and cousin also the same. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-PDTe5U11c&t=60.0s)]
*  We just need them back. It doesn't matter that we don't have a home anymore. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-PDTe5U11c&t=65.0s)]
*  It's all burned. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-PDTe5U11c&t=70.0s)]
*  I don't want my home. I don't want my whole childhood. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-PDTe5U11c&t=72.0s)]
*  It's okay. I just want them back. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-PDTe5U11c&t=77.0s)]
