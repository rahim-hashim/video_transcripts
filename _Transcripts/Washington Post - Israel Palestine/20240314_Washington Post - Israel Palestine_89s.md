# Schumer says Netanyahu has 'lost his way'
**Washington Post - Israel Palestine:** [March 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bydSg7sweP8)
*  The fourth major obstacle to peace is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bydSg7sweP8&t=0.0s)]
*  who has all too frequently bowed to the demands of extremists like Ministers Smotrik and Ben Gavir and the settlers in the West Bank. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bydSg7sweP8&t=6.0s)]
*  I have known Prime Minister Netanyahu for a very long time. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bydSg7sweP8&t=16.0s)]
*  While we have vehemently disagreed on many occasions, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bydSg7sweP8&t=20.0s)]
*  I will always respect his extraordinary bravery for Israel on the battlefield as a younger man, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bydSg7sweP8&t=23.0s)]
*  I believe in his heart he has his highest priority, as is the security of Israel. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bydSg7sweP8&t=29.0s)]
*  However, I also believe Prime Minister Netanyahu has lost his way [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bydSg7sweP8&t=36.0s)]
*  by allowing his political survival to take the precedence over the best interests of Israel. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bydSg7sweP8&t=43.0s)]
*  As a lifelong supporter of Israel, it has become clear to me [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bydSg7sweP8&t=51.0s)]
*  the Netanyahu coalition no longer fits the needs of Israel after October 7th. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bydSg7sweP8&t=56.0s)]
*  The world has changed radically since then, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bydSg7sweP8&t=63.0s)]
*  and the Israeli people are being stifled right now by a governing vision that has stuck in the past. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bydSg7sweP8&t=67.0s)]
*  Nobody expects Prime Minister Netanyahu to do the things that must be done to break the cycle of violence, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bydSg7sweP8&t=75.0s)]
*  to preserve Israel's credibility on the world stage, and to work towards a two-state solution. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bydSg7sweP8&t=82.0s)]
