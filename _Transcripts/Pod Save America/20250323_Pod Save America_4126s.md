Video Description: As the dumpster fire of U.S. politics shoots sparks across the globe, will the Pentagon supply safeguards or sycophants? What will MAGA authoritarianism look like for our communities and those abroad? And should Democrats be reconsidering their approach to law and order? Congressman Adam Smith sits down with Tommy to discuss the state of American national security, and what Democrats need to do differently to broaden their coalition. Then, Tommy and Jon answer listeners' questions on whether Democrats need their own Tea Party, Gen Z's rightward shift, and if podcasting is for the faint of heart.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Adam Smith on How Democrats Should More Aggressively Challenge Trump
**Pod Save America:** [March 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw)
*  Welcome back to Pod Save America. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm John Favreau. This is weird for you me with the sticks [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=0.0s)]
*  Honestly love it [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=6.32s)]
*  John and I are in the studio today. Love it is on its way to Wisconsin [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=8.4s)]
*  Where he's doing some campaigning for a very important judicial race. Yeah, that's cool [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=11.52s)]
*  You and I are gonna be out with Ro Khanna on Sunday when you're hearing this probably yeah doing a town hall [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=15.76s)]
*  he's to his great credit Ro Khanna is going to [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=21.0s)]
*  Republican districts where the elected officials refuse to talk to their constituents [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=24.36s)]
*  But all of this is a topper for our Sunday episode this week, which I did talk to [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=28.919999999999998s)]
*  Congressman Adam Smith. He he represents Washington's 9th congressional district. He's been there for about 30 years. He and I connected [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=34.8s)]
*  last year after [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  Remember when Joe Biden did that debate? Oh [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=44.4s)]
*  He didn't do so well knows back. Yeah bad [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=47.04s)]
*  Con we held our tongue [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=49.96s)]
*  Congressman Smith he was not a big fan of that performance either and then we've stayed in touch since and in December [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=52.68s)]
*  I started talking to him and he wanted to come on the show to talk about you know [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  What happened in 2024 his vision going forward? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=62.0s)]
*  And so on and so forth and so he was in LA when was that Wednesday? Yeah, and honestly [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=65.24s)]
*  We had we had planned to talk for 15 or 20 minutes [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=71.47999999999999s)]
*  But it was just such an interesting [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=75.32s)]
*  conversation that we went and went and went and all of a sudden it had been 45 minutes and [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=78.16s)]
*  It's rare for a politician. I know I was like this is fascinating. This guy has a lot of big ideas [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  He's a national security expert. He's been in politics for a long time [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=87.32000000000001s)]
*  He has thoughts about how to build the biggest coalition possible for the party. So we thought alright Sunday episode cool [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=90.08s)]
*  Let's do it [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=97.04s)]
*  And so we're gonna listen to congressman and Smith and then afterwards John and I are gonna do some Q&A from our discord subscribers [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  So stick around for that. So without further ado here is congressman Adam Smith congressman Adam Smith great to see you [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=105.08s)]
*  Thanks for coming into the LA studio here. Yeah, it's great to be here. Thanks for having me on [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=112.44s)]
*  So we're talking Wednesday morning [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=115.76s)]
*  Over the last week a lot of progressives including many of your colleagues at the house had voiced [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=118.84s)]
*  Displeasure with Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats about their handling of the Republican continuing resolution that kept the government open [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=124.24s)]
*  I was wondering what you made of Schumer's vote [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=131.84s)]
*  Rationale leadership and if you disagreed with it what you think Democrats should be doing differently in this moment [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=135.24s)]
*  Well, the biggest thing I don't think we should be sucked into an extended play conversation about a CR [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that that's just a starting point. So that's my way of saying I'm not gonna directly answer all different aspects [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=146.39999999999998s)]
*  I'm not question the going forward part is what you do differently is well [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  I use the really frustrating part for me because I think and you know gross [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=154.23999999999998s)]
*  Generalizations are always problematic. But the left side of our coalition is fundamentally right about two big things [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=159.95999999999998s)]
*  Made bill three actually but the two that are relevant here [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=167.44s)]
*  We need to directly confront Donald Trump in a consistent aggressive way. I think that needs to happen [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=171.2s)]
*  I totally disagree with with James Carville's take I understand what he's saying [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=177.32s)]
*  He's saying let the Republicans fail, but it be clear to everyone that they're the ones who failed [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  That's not the world we're living in today today is a 24-7 [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=186.35999999999999s)]
*  Messaging battle for attention agreed and I've been doing it in a way [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=191.16s)]
*  I've never done it before do a lot of my own videos go on media [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  I think we have to point out that Donald Trump is attempting an authoritarian takeover of our government [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=198.20000000000002s)]
*  To the extent that people don't agree with us on that we have to convince them, right now [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=203.6s)]
*  We also have to work work work on other issues [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=208.24s)]
*  So I think the notion that we need to be more aggressive is correct [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=210.24s)]
*  I think the idea that Democrats haven't always picked the best leaders is correct [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=212.88s)]
*  I mean you and I started talking when I was trying to get Joe Biden out of the race, right? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=217.88s)]
*  It still is flabbergasting to me that anybody much less a significant group of people thought that an 82 year old Joe Biden was [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=221.58s)]
*  Was an effective messenger for us and I have respect for the man's career [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=229.0s)]
*  I have respect for a lot of things he did as president [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=233.24s)]
*  But you could see him from four years ago [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=235.36s)]
*  And even if he was doing a good job as president you could know that he wasn't going to be the effective candidate [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=238.28s)]
*  We need so I think we do have a hard time making those judgments [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=244.72s)]
*  Also, I have clashed with Chuck Schumer before details of that story aren't worth getting into so I kind of see that [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=247.44s)]
*  But what really worries me is the same people who are pushing this narrative the hardest [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=253.88s)]
*  Are the same people who spent a lot of the time? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=260.28s)]
*  Sorry, not the exact same people same group the last year protesting Democrats [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=263.92s)]
*  You know when you know, Donald Trump was an existential threat. They were protesting Kamala Harris [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=268.92s)]
*  They were protesting Colin already [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=273.76000000000005s)]
*  They weren't protesting Ted Cruz and Donald Trump [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=275.8s)]
*  So I think we need to look at the broader coalition message and see what some of the flaws are in that [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=279.0s)]
*  Left-leaning approach on policy on immigration on economics on identity politics on [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=286.8s)]
*  Ezra Klein's point in this new book getting things done where we govern [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  So yeah, I don't agree with the way Chuck Schumer handled that [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=298.28000000000003s)]
*  I don't think the messaging was strong. I don't think it's been well organized [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=303.22s)]
*  I do think Hakeem Jeffries did a great job in the house [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=306.82000000000005s)]
*  I think we ought to give him credit for that [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=309.42s)]
*  But what I'm worried about is if we buy into that [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=311.78000000000003s)]
*  Then do we buy into all this other stuff that has really created problems for the Democratic coalition? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=314.46000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think you're getting at something important [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=319.3s)]
*  Which is I think the Times had an analysis week where they said actually the real split in the Democratic Party right now isn't really even on [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=321.70000000000005s)]
*  It's about how hard should we fight or or not fight and they juxtapose Gavin Newsom talking to [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=328.5s)]
*  Conservatives on his podcast with like JB Pritzker using harsh words [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=334.90000000000003s)]
*  Which I don't I don't really think there's that much of a tension there [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=338.58s)]
*  But I think what you're getting at let's just name a specific Gaza [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=341.26s)]
*  There were a lot of protests of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on Gaza. I understand why those protesters were there [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=344.66s)]
*  I thought the Biden policy on Gaza was awful and immoral and indefensible when I said as much publicly at the time [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=349.78000000000003s)]
*  But I've been thinking a lot about how we should reconstitute a [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=355.26s)]
*  pro-palestinian rights anti-war coalition in the Trump era and it has to be like red rose socialists to [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=358.98s)]
*  Rand-Paul [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=368.18s)]
*  Conservatives everyone is welcome under that coalition or effort to stop the war and I think the only way you can keep it together [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=369.26s)]
*  Is if we do not tell people how to oppose the war you don't have to use the word [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=375.3s)]
*  Genocide to oppose this war you don't have to be anti-zionist to oppose this war [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=380.66s)]
*  You can just think I support the state of Israel, but I think this is a horrific humanitarian disaster [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=386.12s)]
*  That's not making any of us safer. That's gonna redound against the US right a broad tent, right? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=391.78000000000003s)]
*  The other part of it. Yes [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=397.1s)]
*  we have to have a broad tent the other part is that broad tent has to be really focused on defeating Donald Trump in the [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=398.08000000000004s)]
*  MAGA movement and within within our coalition. There's a lot of differences of opinion [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=403.38s)]
*  We have to figure out how to bring bring enough of them together so that we can defeat Trump [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=407.96000000000004s)]
*  Because whether you're taught I mean on on Gaza and there's a lot of differences of opinion on that Donald Trump's not better [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=412.6s)]
*  No on that issue MAGA people aren't better on that issue. And then there's a whole host of other things [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=419.28000000000003s)]
*  So the challenge that I'm trying to take on [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=425.12s)]
*  Politics is about building coalitions [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=427.64s)]
*  My fundamental theory is that our coalition is broken and the Democratic Party brand is broken and I don't presume to have all the answers [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=429.44s)]
*  But we have to start the conversation and we have to force it forward and we have to have [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=437.56s)]
*  disagreements about it and not try to say there's only one way to do it and we're gonna force everybody into that and I'm hoping [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=442.08000000000004s)]
*  to have that broader open conversation about how to rebuild the coalition and [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=448.44s)]
*  Rebuild the brand and address the policy issues [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=452.64000000000004s)]
*  We need to address got a challenge Trump for being authoritarian [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=455.42s)]
*  Got a challenge him on economic issues on the way that is impacting people's lives beyond the democracy thing [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=459.12s)]
*  But then we have to have a reasonable alternative for the American people and I think the biggest reason Donald Trump won [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=464.64s)]
*  Was because too many people didn't think we did right? I agree with that [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=472.36s)]
*  And so I mean since the election there has been this kind of messy debate about why we lost in 2024 [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=476.0s)]
*  But also what to do going forward [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=481.18s)]
*  This week this Democratic data firm called group Blue Rose research released their analysis of why Democrats lost in 2024 [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=483.12s)]
*  it was based on both I think like 24 million pieces of survey data and [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=489.0s)]
*  Precinct level voter data. So like, you know a lot of inputs here [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=494.6s)]
*  Some of the core findings are [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=499.92s)]
*  Hispanic Asian and young voters in politically disengaged voters all swung towards Trump [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=502.04s)]
*  Democrats are losing very badly with young men, especially young white men. The gender gap is massive among young men [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=507.32s)]
*  Democrats did not lose because of a turnout problem in 2024 [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=514.8s)]
*  in fact [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=517.72s)]
*  Blue Rose found that if more people voted Trump would have won by more and [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=518.2s)]
*  They found that Democrats took a huge hit when it came to voter confidence in our ability to fix the economy and deal [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=521.72s)]
*  With cost of living issues wondering does that sound right to you and that person far more difficult question? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=527.24s)]
*  I guess is what course corrections do we make to fix those impressions or you know losing young men, for example? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=532.16s)]
*  Yeah, I think we have to do [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=538.8399999999999s)]
*  Multiple things at the same time in terms of messaging [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=542.76s)]
*  I think like I said, we do need to make the case against Donald Trump now the one thing I would would [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=545.92s)]
*  I think we need to stop this debate about what the right way to do that is [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=551.04s)]
*  I put out a statement about the whole Al Green Alyssa Slotkin thing. We had this huge debate within the coalition [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=555.12s)]
*  Oh the Democrats are not on the same page. You had a green out there screaming [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=561.4s)]
*  Yeah, Alyssa Slotkin giving you know, which which approach is right? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=565.24s)]
*  Both churches. All right. Okay good for Al Green [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=568.88s)]
*  Yeah for standing up to Donald Trump and saying you're a liar and on January 6th [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=572.56s)]
*  You besmirch the very institutions that you're asking me to come here and respect [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=577.0s)]
*  Good for him making that point forcefully and good for Alyssa Slotkin for clearly [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=581.42s)]
*  articulately in a measured way [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=587.04s)]
*  Laying out an agenda that a broader group of it's got to be everybody. We've got this fight [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=589.12s)]
*  No, you got to scream louder. No, I guess depends on the circumstances. So you gotta pull all that together [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=593.28s)]
*  But I also come back and this is where and I've spoken with Ezra Klein a couple of times [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=598.36s)]
*  We got to govern better we just have to get things done for California we feel that one [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=602.86s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm Washington State by the Seattle King County area, you know, we have we are drowning in process in inclusion [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=608.4200000000001s)]
*  We're not building housing. We're not building roads. We're not building high-speed rail [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=615.74s)]
*  We're not governing effectively because we've fallen in love with too much process and too much inclusion as opposed to getting things done for people [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=620.38s)]
*  Now there's a lot of blame to go around here and I'm dragged into this world of are you a centrist or are you on the left? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=629.62s)]
*  And I went through those battles in the 80s and 90s. I was New Democrat part of the DLC early [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=636.42s)]
*  2000s Simon Rosenberg was a good friend of mine and I sort of felt like the New Dem movement was losing its way to some extent [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=643.26s)]
*  And I concluded that you know, what we need is we need the center and the left. It's not okay [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=649.9s)]
*  Which side is right? We got to figure out how to work better together going forward [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=655.26s)]
*  But my frustration in the Seattle King County area is that a lot of left-leaning policies have proven ineffective and that's fine [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=660.02s)]
*  This is a complicated very difficult business. What are a couple examples? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=668.38s)]
*  criminal justice housing homelessness drug abuse [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=672.7s)]
*  drug [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=676.3000000000001s)]
*  Decriminalization efforts. It seems like there's been a lot body of research that it's not going well, correct [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=677.7800000000001s)]
*  but also just basic insistence on [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=682.72s)]
*  Competency accountability and personal responsibility in addition to helping people we've set up [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=686.62s)]
*  organizations based more on identity and lived experience than competency at the task [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=692.86s)]
*  So as a consequence a lot of the money that we've poured in homes. This hasn't been well spent [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=698.62s)]
*  It's going to organizations who don't know how to run a business don't know how to build housing or run housing [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=703.3s)]
*  So we haven't been as focused on efficiency and effectiveness in what we've been spending and also [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=710.2800000000001s)]
*  I think that the balance and we needed criminal justice reform. I'm a hundred percent opposed to mass incarceration [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=716.1600000000001s)]
*  I think we've made progress on that but can we have accountability in the alternatives to incarceration programs? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=721.6800000000001s)]
*  We don't have that accountability in King County and the other aspect of it [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=727.44s)]
*  Which we've alluded to earlier is so I noticed this like four years ago five years ago [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=731.52s)]
*  I started having conversations and the resistance to any changes to trying to make it better every time I asked a question [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=736.12s)]
*  I was like, well, you're just you know, you're in favor of mass incarceration. You're you're citing Republican talking points [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=743.8399999999999s)]
*  I'm just trying to fix a problem, right? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=750.64s)]
*  Trying to make his work better [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=752.76s)]
*  So I think the ideological rigidity and that came out a lot in the opposition to Gaza. I mean [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=754.16s)]
*  Using threats and intimidation to try to silence people who disagree with you should not be a progressive value [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=762.16s)]
*  and I've had that happen I had a town hall meeting last June and [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=768.7199999999999s)]
*  Could not conduct the meeting because it was just insults were screamed [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=773.68s)]
*  They wouldn't let anybody else talk and the entire civic discourse broke down [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=777.14s)]
*  Because of that approach so I think we need to be more inclusive and more results oriented [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=783.02s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I respect and support everyone's right to protest however they want [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=789.2s)]
*  I also respect and support my right to tell you when you're being an idiot and making things worse [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=793.82s)]
*  And I think if you look at efforts to defeat authoritarian movements around the world [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=798.86s)]
*  It only works when there is the broadest possible coalition most recently [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=804.12s)]
*  there's a there's a damn near neo-nazi who almost became the Chancellor of Austria and only because [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=808.6800000000001s)]
*  Three different parties came together to finally form a government did he get blocked from taking power? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=814.72s)]
*  So and part of that has to be it just open and honest conversations [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=819.78s)]
*  Yeah, and that's what I've really struggled with in areas where the Democratic Party is essentially a one-party system [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=823.16s)]
*  Which is California Washington State Seattle King County [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=829.88s)]
*  They tend to grab on to that power and then say don't you question me? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=833.52s)]
*  Yeah, challenge and this is where like, you know, Gavin Newsom's taking some shit right now [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=837.22s)]
*  And I think that the idea in principle is a good one [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=841.22s)]
*  Maybe the execution hasn't been perfect or great so far [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=844.82s)]
*  But I support that I mean, you know, I'd Glenn Greenwald on pod save the world my foreign policy show the other day [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=848.7s)]
*  I've got a lot of shit from people that just didn't want to hear from him [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=853.3000000000001s)]
*  But I actually thought it was interesting to talk to him about First Amendment [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=855.74s)]
*  Can I critique that because the important part is one of these I've always said and I I go on Fox News [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=858.62s)]
*  I I I think I don't actually was on Matt Gaetz's podcast. Yes years ago. I wrote a book [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=863.26s)]
*  That it wasn't about policy. I think we as [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=870.0200000000001s)]
*  Progressives as Democrats we have we can't seed the ground [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=873.1400000000001s)]
*  I agree but the thing that kills me about what Gavin is doing you got a challenge the person, correct? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=876.94s)]
*  I mean don't see that you sure don't see be there in the trance thing [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=883.0200000000001s)]
*  You know, I think you need to understand that it is not primarily about whether or not trans women should play in sports [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=887.74s)]
*  It's about the fact that there is a movement in this country that is trying to dehumanize [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=895.22s)]
*  Target and act like trans people don't exist and the rhetoric around that [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=900.58s)]
*  So, you know you want to have a conversation about who should play in what leagues I'm open to it [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=905.14s)]
*  But when you're out there saying there's only two genders when you're banning transgender people from serving in the military [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=909.74s)]
*  When you're denigrating them and insulting them, I'm gonna forget the exact quote, but there was a quote that Charlie [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=915.38s)]
*  Kirk used against that basically they're freaks and weirdos [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=921.5s)]
*  I mean he is dehumanizing and challenging the very existence of a group of people and [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=925.22s)]
*  If you can't stand up and fight back against that if you get dragged into a conversation [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=932.1800000000001s)]
*  About a little league baseball team. Yeah completely agree. There is a [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=937.34s)]
*  Fundamental threshold issue about human rights in humanity and we need to give no quarter on those issues ever [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=941.9s)]
*  You want to have a separate issue about sports fairness at the high school level fine [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=947.94s)]
*  But I think that should be handled by local leaders. Amen, and we don't need to demagogue people and that's clearly what's happening [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=952.24s)]
*  Okay, we're gonna take a quick break. We come back more with my conversation with Adam Smith [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=958.16s)]

*  So on Tuesday, President Trump spoke to Vladimir Putin for an hour and a half or so [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1162.64s)]
*  Putin says he will agree to a 30-day pause on bombing Ukrainian energy infrastructure [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1168.06s)]
*  I have no confidence that he will fall through already broken. Yeah, it sounds like there's already been some ceasefire violations [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1173.1799999999998s)]
*  but basically Putin held his his maximalist positions on basically every other part of [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1179.26s)]
*  The negotiation at least if you read the Russian language read out of his side of the of the call [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1185.1799999999998s)]
*  What's your level of confidence that Trump can broker some sort of peace agreement? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1190.3799999999999s)]
*  And I would imagine you talk with people at the White House and the State Department Republicans in Congress [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1194.62s)]
*  Like what do they say when you ask them? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1199.78s)]
*  Why is Donald Trump giving every concession to Putin preemptively while hammering Zelensky? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1202.62s)]
*  Well, there's two ways of looking at it. My confidence level is very low by the way [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1208.06s)]
*  one of them is [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1213.1799999999998s)]
*  Worrisome the other one is catastrophic [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1215.78s)]
*  One is that Trump genuinely wants to get a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1218.02s)]
*  And it's not incorrect to say that as long as Ukraine was insisting on their maximalist goals [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1223.62s)]
*  Retake all of Ukrainian territory [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1230.6599999999999s)]
*  Try Putin for war crimes, right force Russia to repay and I've had this conversation with Zelensky [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1233.22s)]
*  As well as with others to say we're with you. We're gonna defend you and help you [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1239.1399999999999s)]
*  But that's a war that you can't win [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1243.6999999999998s)]
*  So we got to get to a path and if you want to put a little pressure on Zelensky to say hey [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1246.72s)]
*  Let's come to the table and have that conversation [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1250.78s)]
*  So the charitable view is that that is what Trump is trying to do [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1252.86s)]
*  The problem with that view is it only works if you also put pressure on Putin and this is the argument that I had [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1257.6200000000001s)]
*  last year when we were arguing over passing this the supplemental to help Ukraine and [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1265.38s)]
*  A lot of Republicans who claim to support Ukraine were like yeah, but we got to get to peace and we're not doing this [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1269.98s)]
*  Right. We're not doing that right said, okay great [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1276.82s)]
*  But if we cut off Ukraine, they're dead. Yeah, so I'm happy to have that conversation [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1279.9799999999998s)]
*  But there's a threshold question here. Are we gonna support Ukraine and put them in a position to defend themselves? [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1285.34s)]
*  So when Trump comes in and cuts off Intel sharing and cuts off aid and cuts off the military assistance [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1291.4199999999998s)]
*  He's just throwing the door wide open for Putin. You got to put pressure on Putin to force him to the table [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1297.9399999999998s)]
*  He's the one who started the war and the only pressure is you have to give security guarantees to Ukraine and cutting off their assistance [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1304.74s)]
*  Is the exact opposite of giving security guarantees to Ukraine? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1312.0600000000002s)]
*  So the charitable way of looking at this is that Trump's a little incompetent in terms of how he negotiates [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1316.1000000000001s)]
*  There is a darker vision and that is personified by Marjorie Taylor Greene and a variety of other white Christian [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1321.78s)]
*  Nationalists who populate the Republican Party what was Cheney lovingly referred to as the Putin wing of the Republican Party that views [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1328.86s)]
*  Vladimir Putin in Russia as an ally. Yeah, because he is anti woke [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1337.38s)]
*  Yeah, he is a white Christian nationalist. Yeah, so and which side of that is calling the shots [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1342.74s)]
*  I wish I had more confidence that it was the side that just wants peace and they're going at it awkwardly [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1349.78s)]
*  I'm deeply worried that Trump is aligning us with Putin and Russia's vision for the world [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1355.28s)]
*  Which is a dark and terrible vision. Yeah, there there is a world where Trump [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1362.16s)]
*  I mean, I think we sort of see it in his demeanor and the words he says where he is more comfortable with he feels more [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1366.48s)]
*  connected to more aligned with [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1372.04s)]
*  Autocrats including Putin and by the way, Putin's like religiosity is a pretty recent. Oh, it's bullshit [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1374.24s)]
*  Exactly, it's it's it's a it's a fascist clinging to whatever unites the people exactly any good fascist has to has to have like [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1380.4399999999998s)]
*  You know that sort of their following in there. Exactly. Yeah [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1387.6s)]
*  I've been reading this book about Steve Bannon and his connection to this kind of small group of right-wing literal fascists [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1390.34s)]
*  We're also kind of a cultist called traditionalists and it gets into it. I write about that. Yeah, Alexander Dugan. He's very scary [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1397.4199999999998s)]
*  Genocidal Russian thinker and it's very weird that Steve Bannon met with Dugan and he's kind of Putin's guy [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1404.6399999999999s)]
*  All of which is why it is so important [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1410.76s)]
*  That the Democratic Coalition gets its shit together and fights that and and and and again the whole center left thing [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1413.76s)]
*  I get dragged into that world a lot, but I am [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1421.04s)]
*  frustrated [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1425.12s)]
*  with the left's [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1426.08s)]
*  To make changes in policy that so that we can build more housing so that our streets can be safer so that we can have more [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1428.32s)]
*  Competent pot and I understand where a lot of this comes from [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1434.6999999999998s)]
*  You know power has been abused and in our country power has primarily been held by straight white men [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1438.08s)]
*  Historically, so, you know, they wanted to go after the power structure. That's fine [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1445.56s)]
*  but you have to have rules and standards and [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1449.8799999999999s)]
*  Hierarchies in order to actually accomplish things for the people that we progressives want to help [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1453.04s)]
*  Chaos only benefits the people who already have enough money that they don't have to worry about it [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1458.52s)]
*  So could we update that ever so slightly so that we actually have fun if the power system is [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1463.24s)]
*  Abused fix it get the right people in place hold the people accountable who are abusing it [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1471.76s)]
*  But then you have to have rules you have to have standards [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1476.5s)]
*  Accountability personal responsibility so you can build a better safer society so that we can go to the public and say, you know [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1480.8799999999999s)]
*  Not just don't go with the fascist [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1488.3999999999999s)]
*  Which I would I would have hoped that that would have been enough one would think I will be honest with you [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1490.8s)]
*  But it's very clear that it's not no [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1495.48s)]
*  So we have to say come with us because here's how we're gonna build a better life for people [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1497.2s)]
*  Fascism is very hot right now, especially with young young white men. Look at Germany. Look at the AFD party [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1502.84s)]
*  It's also driving me insane that Trump primarily talks about alliances as some sort of financial burden and rather than understanding that we created NATO [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1507.88s)]
*  We constructed it as it is because it ate ton of control and power [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1515.3200000000002s)]
*  We didn't want the French and everybody, you know, we don't want a massive amounts of nuclear non-proliferation [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1519.6000000000001s)]
*  Some of it happened, but we wanted to fold them into our system and he just doesn't seem to get that I work a lot [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1524.8400000000001s)]
*  I think I mentioned Simon Rosenberg [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1529.42s)]
*  I've worked with him a lot a bunch of different issues and he's in favor of opening a second front [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1531.5600000000002s)]
*  Front number one is Trump's destroying our economy and you know threatening the whole bunch of different things threat number two is he's making us weaker [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1535.5600000000002s)]
*  He is actually making us more vulnerable as a country that his national security strategy is making us weaker more vulnerable [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1541.96s)]
*  more vulnerable and economically less strong and that these institutions that he's smashing because he just sees it as you know [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1550.2800000000002s)]
*  Basically, he sees allies and partners as people to be exploited [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1559.5600000000002s)]
*  Not as a partnership that is making us weaker and the idea that the system of alliances that we built [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1563.48s)]
*  Was a giveaway by the US to the rest of the world [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1571.12s)]
*  We benefited from that more than anybody by having the richest most powerful country in the history of the world now [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1574.48s)]
*  We screwed up on the distribution of that wealth, right? We've generated a lot of wealth [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1580.6999999999998s)]
*  We've concentrated in the hands of the few and left the working class behind [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1585.8799999999999s)]
*  But the notion that we have become weaker because of that [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1590.28s)]
*  We need to go after Trump for weakening us by like picking fights with everybody in the world isolating us [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1593.6000000000001s)]
*  It makes us less safe. Yeah, and economic inequality is a completely fixable problem by government [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1599.48s)]
*  Taxation through redistribution we could do this [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1606.0s)]
*  Trump and Pete Hexeth who somehow became Secretary of Defense. They're conducting this purge of senior military leaders [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1608.96s)]
*  Along strictly racist and sexist lines, I mean I'm not being hyperbolic here [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1616.42s)]
*  They call it DEI but seek you around the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1621.5s)]
*  He was fired for talking about being a black man in America in one five-minute video after George Floyd was murdered [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1624.46s)]
*  Similarly senior leaders at the Navy and at the Coast Guard have been fired because they are women [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1631.6200000000001s)]
*  How do you think these moves are impacting the armed forces their ability to recruit? [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1637.1000000000001s)]
*  Readiness see that would be the second leg in in my three-leg stool about how Donald Trump is making us weaker [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1643.3799999999999s)]
*  by weakening our institutions by weakening our federal government and [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1649.08s)]
*  Certainly at DOD, but he's doing it at NIH. He's doing it at the FAA [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1653.66s)]
*  He's doing it at the National Nuclear Security Agency by randomly firing people [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1658.58s)]
*  Canceling programs and sowing chaos amongst our workforce. He is making us weaker [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1664.5s)]
*  And yes, he is making us weaker at the Pentagon [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1669.8999999999999s)]
*  I have a death of Stalin analogy, which I like to use at this point [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1672.58s)]
*  So it's bad enough and CQ Brown is a highly qualified individual [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1676.4599999999998s)]
*  He has led commands and a whole bunch of deputy sent com commander ran the Air Force [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1681.28s)]
*  I believe I did and I've met with him. I've worked with him for years deeply talented individual [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1685.2199999999998s)]
*  So getting rid of that level of talent right off the bat makes you weaker [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1690.1999999999998s)]
*  But the death of Stalin analogy is at the start of that movie. Stalin has a stroke doesn't die [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1694.28s)]
*  And they show up and what do we do? Well, we got to go get a doctor [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1699.04s)]
*  Let's get the best doctor available and it's like we don't really have a best doctor. What do you mean? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1702.32s)]
*  We don't well [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1706.8999999999999s)]
*  We kind of we we either killed them or we sent them to Siberia to make sure that they were loyal to us [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1707.6399999999999s)]
*  So they're all just kind of not that good anymore [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1712.0s)]
*  Right and that's what you get because it's okay [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1714.32s)]
*  They they fired CQ Brown and they fired others as well the people who are left [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1717.1999999999998s)]
*  Now some of them will be brave and some of them will say I'm doing my job and I don't care [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1722.7199999999998s)]
*  And then they'll get fired but a lot of people say if this is the way the game is played [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1727.6s)]
*  I know that being competent being good at my job is not important [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1732.0s)]
*  I simply have to be a sycophant and a loyalist to Trump [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1735.64s)]
*  I'm gonna do that and I'm not gonna focus on actually running this place [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1738.32s)]
*  Well, that will weaken us. Yeah all across the board and certainly at the Pentagon. So [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1741.8s)]
*  Look, Donald Trump is attempting an authoritarian takeover of our country. Yeah, I was with a group last night of [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1749.04s)]
*  Silicon Valley like people defense industry folks and talking about this and they were attempting to argue [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1758.16s)]
*  Well, we're gonna say I'm like no [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1763.24s)]
*  We this is what's happening. I mean they fired someone at the Justice Department for not giving Mel Gibson back his gun rights [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1765.84s)]
*  Yeah, that seems wrong. Well, it's not just wrong. It is an authoritarian takeover of the government [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1773.1200000000001s)]
*  It's saying no, no, no, no, no Justice Department DOD NIH [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1779.66s)]
*  I don't care who you are. You do not work for the American people [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1783.76s)]
*  You do not work to uphold the laws of the Constitution [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1787.3600000000001s)]
*  You work for Donald Trump and you will do what Donald Trump tells you to do when he tells you to do it or you will [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1790.9s)]
*  Be gone. That is an authoritarian takeover of our government and we ought to call it that now [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1796.48s)]
*  I think we got to be intelligent about how we do that and [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1803.48s)]
*  Simply, you know running around with our hair on fire and screaming about it and yelling at people [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1806.48s)]
*  Is it necessarily the most effective way to do that? Yeah, but we should be 100% [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1810.56s)]
*  Clear-eyed about what we're dealing with. Yeah, I mean the only good I have a sliver of good news and then some more bad news [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1816.04s)]
*  The judge indefinitely blocked Trump's ban on transgender service members. It's just an insane decision to tell I think 13,000 [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1822.0s)]
*  American citizens that they cannot serve their country because of who they are [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1829.9199999999998s)]
*  But I did also notice that earlier this week [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1833.1599999999999s)]
*  Trump named a bunch of right-wing activists and allies to boards that oversee US military service academies [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1835.92s)]
*  So I'll give you a couple names Mike Flynn. He's now named to the West Point oversight board. I'm sure you know him [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1841.72s)]
*  Well, I know Mike Flynn. Yeah, I knew him before everyone knew unfortunately [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1847.16s)]
*  I did too as you work for Obama pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI once posted a video where he pledged allegiance to QAnon [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1850.8400000000001s)]
*  Walt Nauta was appointed to oversee the Naval Academy. He's Trump's former military aide [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1856.6000000000001s)]
*  He was charged with obstructing the government in the classified documents case Charlie Kirk [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1860.96s)]
*  We talked about earlier was named to the board overseeing the Air Force Charlie has zero military experience. He's just a right-wing propagandist [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1864.52s)]
*  These are almost like comically terrible picks. But what do these boards do? What is the impact here? [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1871.6s)]
*  I mean they they don't do a great well [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1875.88s)]
*  they they have influence over the curriculum over how the Air Force Academy is run, however, how West Point is run and [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1880.08s)]
*  So they are going to be pitching their unique right-wing ideology and also back to the point [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1887.0s)]
*  I just made earlier they're gonna be making sure that everyone's loyal to Trump and Trump's agenda first last and then always and [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1893.36s)]
*  That's what their focus is going to be. It's going to be to put forward Trump's right-wing agenda. But again [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1900.8s)]
*  Agenda aside it's going to be about loyalty to Trump not trying to actually accomplish something for the American people [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1908.28s)]
*  So yeah, that's one of many aspects to it and also on the authoritarian takeover part [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1915.8s)]
*  Can we please stop having people write articles about well Trump hasn't actually you know [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1920.24s)]
*  Pushed a constitutional crisis yet because he hasn't actually defied the courts. Yes [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1925.72s)]
*  He's repeatedly defied the courts [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1932.0s)]
*  now the courts have not yet taken the next logical step in that situation and that is to [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1934.2s)]
*  Sanction the Trump administration people because that's the way I'm an attorney [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1940.04s)]
*  I never practiced that much, but I went to law school. So I have vague ideas about the stuff [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1944.08s)]
*  Prosecuted briefly for the city of Seattle and the way it works is if you defy the judge [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1947.98s)]
*  The next step is [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1953.7s)]
*  Sanctions go to jail get fined contempt contempt. Exactly. They've defied [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1955.9399999999998s)]
*  Probably at least a couple dozen different court orders at this point now the courts [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1961.82s)]
*  I think rightfully so are reluctant to step in and pick this rather monumental fight [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1966.62s)]
*  So they're keep holding out hope that well, they're taking their time, but eventually they'll comply [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1972.3s)]
*  John Roberts putting out statements trying to calm Trump down. Please comply, right? You know pretty please could you so [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1977.98s)]
*  But we're gonna reach the point [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1984.02s)]
*  I think we've reached it already where they're gonna have to sanction them or admit that their rulings are irrelevant [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1985.54s)]
*  Yeah, Trump is defying the courts right now and we shouldn't let anyone get away with saying well [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1992.7s)]
*  Sort of no he is 100% defying court rulings and we should hold him accountable for it last foreign policy question for you [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=1999.9399999999998s)]
*  I mean this this week alone our [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2007.7s)]
*  America first [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2010.3s)]
*  isolationist anti-war president reportedly greenlit the Israelis restarting bombing in Gaza [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2011.94s)]
*  And or the US military to begin the sustained bombing campaign against the Houthi rebels in Yemen [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2018.3s)]
*  Do you think there is more village military value to? [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2023.3400000000001s)]
*  Continued bombardment of Gaza after this place was obliterated over 15 months and regarding the Houthis. What's the legal basis for them? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2027.5s)]
*  Framing this as a long-term [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2035.06s)]
*  Bombing campaign aka a war [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2037.5s)]
*  And you see any evidence that their team has new intelligence or a new strategy? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2040.4199999999998s)]
*  That the Biden administration didn't have because Joe Biden bombed the shit out of the Houthis for what a year and they came to the conclusion [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2044.1799999999998s)]
*  That they have failed to deter them. Yeah, there's an important overarching frame here on what we as you know [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2049.82s)]
*  Democrats should do about national security policy, which I want to get into an answer question [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2056.7s)]
*  No, there is no value and going back to bombing Gaza [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2060.66s)]
*  We should not support that that is wrong the president green-neil lighting that is completely wrong on the Houthis [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2063.6200000000003s)]
*  I actually I got a call from Deputy Chief of Staff [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2069.54s)]
*  telling me that they were gonna start this campaign up against the Houthis and it was really funny because [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2073.82s)]
*  The guy I'm forgetting his name now [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2078.54s)]
*  Was you know, he was reading to me like President Trump has determined that we will not stand for that [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2081.1800000000003s)]
*  He got like a sentence into and I said, who do you think you're talking? I said, okay [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2087.02s)]
*  Look we've done this before and I've seen the plans and I've met with General [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2090.62s)]
*  Crilla and a sin comm commander and all that so operationally, what do you guys do? What targets are you hitting? [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2095.7799999999997s)]
*  How do you think this is going to be successful? [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2101.7s)]
*  you know what are do we have partners on this and [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2104.2999999999997s)]
*  He said he kept repeating. I have no operational details for you. I have no operational details for you [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2108.18s)]
*  So so yeah, I mean I will say the Houthis are attacking [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2114.2999999999997s)]
*  US ships they are blocking the shipping line [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2119.82s)]
*  They had been apparently they were it seems like they were they said they would resume attacks on ships [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2122.54s)]
*  But it hadn't yet. So this was a preemptive strike. Mmm, they they took a shot at a US [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2127.2200000000003s)]
*  Destroyer and they took a shot at a US. They're not good guys. These are bad fucking good [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2132.98s)]
*  But kill aid workers like I'm we're no Houthi fans [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2138.98s)]
*  Oh, no, but I'm just going to the legal just sure there is a legal just think it's a response [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2141.38s)]
*  Yes, force protection now is there a plan behind it that's going to get to us get us to a better place [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2146.5s)]
*  I don't believe there is the only real plan would be getting [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2152.46s)]
*  Enforcing a peace deal in Gaza enforcing a peace deal between the Israelis the Palestinians and the Saudis and all of that [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2156.66s)]
*  But overall whenever we as Democrats are talking about national security [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2163.18s)]
*  I think we have to understand what Trump's appeal is his appeal is number one [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2167.7s)]
*  He said I'm gonna get us out of foreign wars [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2171.94s)]
*  Yep, we're being dragged into too many things and then and I have I have sympathy for that me too [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2173.8599999999997s)]
*  Number two. He said the US is getting screwed and every deal we've ever made, right? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2178.58s)]
*  I'm gonna start screwing the other guy for you for you the American people like the USMCA [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2183.14s)]
*  Whoever negotiated that yeah, exactly. Yeah, it's absurd [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2187.2999999999997s)]
*  on a deeper level than what I [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2191.7799999999997s)]
*  Didn't articulate as well as I would have liked a moment ago about how the global alliances actually do benefit us [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2194.18s)]
*  But understand that to the average American the notion that foreigners are screwing us is something that they're kind of sympathetic sure [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2199.86s)]
*  Nationalistic. Yeah, right. So when you're countering that you have to show a he's making us less safe and making conflict more likely and [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2207.2200000000003s)]
*  The Houthi thing and also by the way threatening to invade Greenland Panama and Canada [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2215.78s)]
*  Also makes us less less safe because it says to the world that that sort of attack is perfectly okay [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2222.6200000000003s)]
*  And we don't have any problem with it that you can do a might makes right approach to the world [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2229.16s)]
*  It makes us less safe [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2234.7s)]
*  So when we're attacking him attack him for making us weaker and for making us more vulnerable and for undermining our own [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2236.0s)]
*  prosperity by cutting bad deals you can't come out and and just say oh [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2244.72s)]
*  I'm trying to figure out how to say this because I don't I don't [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2251.12s)]
*  Feel this but you can't come out even say you cut off a food program in Sudan you're starving people [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2254.24s)]
*  That's that's awful. You should be able to say that and I do say that [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2259.7999999999997s)]
*  But you got to go a step further and show how what he's doing is harming us [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2263.88s)]
*  Harming the American people self-interest assignment. I fervently believe it is now [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2269.52s)]
*  I also fervently believe that part of being the United States of America is supposed to mean that you care about other people and [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2273.9s)]
*  I will explain, you know the basic human relationships [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2281.16s)]
*  We're all kind of selfish to some extent and there's nothing wrong with that [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2285.52s)]
*  But we also have to interact with the other humans and I think does Rayleigh refer to this as enlightened self-interest [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2288.64s)]
*  Eventually you realize that getting along with the other people is kind of selfish because it's to your benefit [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2295.0s)]
*  You can't talk to my wife. Yes [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2300.52s)]
*  You can't go through life irritating everybody you have to find some way to get along now [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2303.08s)]
*  I also happen to be enough of an idealist to think that we as the US should go beyond that [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2308.0s)]
*  That we're trying to build a more peaceful prosperous world one of Joe Biden's best lines and I've been a critic [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2314.12s)]
*  On a deep deep deep deep level and I wish to God he had never for one second thought about running for a second term [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2321.72s)]
*  But when he trots out the line about how America is the only country that's ever been formed on an idea [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2327.56s)]
*  He's so right about that and that's such an important part of who we are [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2334.6400000000003s)]
*  We didn't just gather around one religion or one nationality or one ethnic group. We gathered around the idea [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2339.08s)]
*  And that the purpose that everyone should have a say in how they are governed [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2346.56s)]
*  That the purpose of government is to always be working towards greater equality and opportunity for all and that to get there [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2349.7200000000003s)]
*  We shouldn't rely just on Kings and you know popes [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2357.32s)]
*  We should use practical [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2361.68s)]
*  Common-sense logic to solve the problems that are in front of us benefiting from the wisdom of all and that idea is so [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2364.0s)]
*  Important, so I don't think we should just walk away from that idea [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2371.6s)]
*  But you also have to argue that what Trump is doing even if you're selfish, it's stupid [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2374.88s)]
*  Yeah [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2381.36s)]
*  I agree with that [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2381.68s)]
*  I mean [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2382.48s)]
*  I think I do think Nick Kristoff had a piece in the New York Times this week where he went to South Sudan and met with [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2382.76s)]
*  People who had died or that family who died or about to die because of USAID cuts and I do think [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2387.44s)]
*  Bringing home and making Republicans own those specific stories to see those images [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2394.8s)]
*  Children who are gonna die because they're no longer [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2401.92s)]
*  That is valuable but associated with that with that trip Kristoff also had this organization [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2404.76s)]
*  try to calculate the impact of you know, the growth and tuberculosis or [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2410.84s)]
*  You know diseases they're gonna boomerang back and hit us and I think that's an important part of the argument you're talking about [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2415.28s)]
*  I've been I've been making this speech for a while [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2419.84s)]
*  I'm the co-chair of the caucus for effective foreign assistance and have been for 16 years [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2422.0s)]
*  I thought about disbanding it the other day because I got Republicans who have worked with me before [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2425.96s)]
*  But if they're not willing to stand up when we literally shut down all foreign assistance [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2431.52s)]
*  How can you continue to be part of the caucus? [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2435.76s)]
*  But I came up as a four-part argument and [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2440.4s)]
*  Depending on the audience I either started with the first three or I started with with the one the three are [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2443.24s)]
*  It is in our national security interests because an unstable world can come home [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2449.48s)]
*  And if people don't have enough to eat if they're facing disease, they are much more likely to be radicalized [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2453.3599999999997s)]
*  Much more likely to rise up. Yes. I know that the leaders of these radical movements tend to be educated fine [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2459.12s)]
*  But the followers are the ones who are desperate and that desperation leads to instability number two disease [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2465.3999999999996s)]
*  And I trust I don't have to make this point [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2471.58s)]
*  It's spreads if AIDS starts spreading across Africa. It's going to start spreading across the world if if if [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2473.58s)]
*  Smallpox and measles and these are they're gonna start spreading across the world [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2481.26s)]
*  So we should care about that number three economics and this is Bill Clinton's old point [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2484.2200000000003s)]
*  You know, we're five percent of the population and 20% of the consumption [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2488.9s)]
*  We need access to markets and you need robust middle-class societies to have a market [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2492.62s)]
*  But then the other argument that I would make is the one that I already made [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2497.94s)]
*  If we're gonna be a Christian nation, can we at least get the good part of the Christian thing? Yeah [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2502.6200000000003s)]
*  Which is you know help your neighbor? Yeah, who's your neighbor? Your neighbor is anybody you can help [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2506.78s)]
*  That's supposed to be who we are and it's then I forget who said it but it's the old cliche [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2511.98s)]
*  America will no longer be great if it ceases to be good that we ought to care [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2516.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah a part of human existence ought to be if you can help somebody [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2521.2200000000003s)]
*  You want to try and do it now we can always do it we got our own shit to worry about [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2525.86s)]
*  Yeah, I think's going on. Yeah, I can't I could cross the street to help that person by got my own kids [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2529.7400000000002s)]
*  I get that but as a general rule if you can help somebody and if you are the world's [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2534.42s)]
*  Largest economy ever you certainly can then you ought to at least try to help some people not everybody [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2542.1800000000003s)]
*  I know we go overboard sometimes and that's the basic argument for why the US should be engaged in the world [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2549.36s)]
*  Totally agree with all that so [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2555.52s)]
*  Final question for you you and I've been sitting here for 30 40 minutes pulling our hair about about this [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2557.6s)]
*  Autocratic threat to our nation about the kind of feeling like the Democratic Party is divided and feckless in this moment [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2562.8799999999997s)]
*  I think all of us are waiting for someone to say to the country [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2569.72s)]
*  It's time to take to the streets. We need mass mobilization. We need protests. We need movement [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2575.56s)]
*  we need to a show of force in a [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2580.9199999999996s)]
*  Entirely peaceful way. Where do you think that leadership? [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2584.08s)]
*  Can come from will it come are you worried that it hasn't come because 2017 felt really different, right? [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2588.0s)]
*  There's marches right away. Now. It's just people are scared shitless and [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2593.72s)]
*  Reading the news. I think we need to make clear the basic path forward [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2598.3599999999997s)]
*  We need to stop talking about what we can't do what we can do is we can organize and deliver the message and that's what? [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2604.0s)]
*  We've done here and I've walked through the message call out the autocratic takeover. Don't be shy about it [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2609.96s)]
*  number two talk about how it's negatively impacting your life and number three [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2614.8s)]
*  Make sure the Democratic Party starts working on how to present a more reasonable alternative actually addresses how to deliver for people [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2619.28s)]
*  Now and and yes mobilize in a thousand different ways [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2626.7200000000003s)]
*  On platforms and elsewhere, but I do think we also have to be smart about it [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2630.08s)]
*  I I don't agree and this happened with a lot of the Gaza stuff [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2633.96s)]
*  You know if you're showing up screaming at people because they disagree with you [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2638.14s)]
*  Yeah, look, I'm not talking about going to Tony Blinken's house and throwing blood on his car [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2642.94s)]
*  I'm talking about like a couple million person protests a women's march [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2646.42s)]
*  I think that would be right [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2649.66s)]
*  But but I want to work with and I want to work with the indivisibles and the move-ons to make sure we do that [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2651.1s)]
*  And I know that you draw this line. It's like well, you know [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2656.22s)]
*  It wasn't the left that was throwing blood on Tony bank and it wasn't a laugh that vandalized my house [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2659.5s)]
*  Or a whole bunch of other other places, but can we talk to those people maybe? [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2664.2599999999998s)]
*  Can't can we and I had this conversation about ten years ago? [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2668.74s)]
*  Around that when I'll polish ice became a thing. I was like, that's just not a good slogan [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2672.94s)]
*  I mean we have to have border enforcement. We have to have more legal immigration [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2677.02s)]
*  We have to have a pathway to citizenship for the end documents, but abolish ice and oh, yeah, it's probably not good [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2681.66s)]
*  I said, yeah, but it's it's the slogan. It's out there. It's everywhere. Yeah, that's what well [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2687.2599999999998s)]
*  Have you talked to people about well and the quote I got was you can't tell activists how to be activists [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2691.46s)]
*  Well, they look and that's not helpful. Well, we shouldn't resign ourselves to [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2696.9s)]
*  Being silent when people do unproductive things, but we can never control the furthest fringe, right? There's some people in the world [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2701.66s)]
*  You're right. You're right. It's a balance [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2708.66s)]
*  But I I don't think I think we've been too quick to just dismiss that as something that we should even worry [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2711.66s)]
*  So I want us to do it effectively [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2717.94s)]
*  I want us to do it intelligently and and loudly and look [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2719.94s)]
*  Let me just say just people don't get the wrong idea as I said earlier good on Al Green for what he did [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2723.5s)]
*  Right now the paddles were ineffective just because they yeah, I say don't be I mean like violent people people breaking laws, right? [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2728.7000000000003s)]
*  Like I think protests have to be peaceful in part because hey, guess what guys the fascists on the other side [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2735.7000000000003s)]
*  They're always gonna out violence us. Yeah be be loud [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2740.92s)]
*  100% for that be loud but also take a little time to listen because we got to persuade more people [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2744.68s)]
*  You know, we got forty eight and a half percent [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2751.08s)]
*  Not terrible, but we got to get a little more so to do that [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2753.68s)]
*  You can't just shout at the people who voted the other way you have to make your points [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2757.36s)]
*  I think loudly forcefully intelligently and respective respectfully and constantly [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2763.6s)]
*  But also take a little time to listen and say this is how I feel [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2769.8399999999997s)]
*  Where are you coming from? [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2774.2s)]
*  And then once you learn where those people are coming from you're in a better position to counter their arguments to understand their arguments [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2775.4399999999996s)]
*  And to bring them in so it's a balance and I worry a little that the general message from a lot of folks is [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2782.3999999999996s)]
*  Whoever breaks the most things is the person I'm gonna follow. Yeah, I mean be loud be passionate [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2788.2799999999997s)]
*  But also there's a part of it that has to also be trying to be more inclusive [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2793.7599999999998s)]
*  A bunch of good ways to do that and I think we've talked about no, I agree [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2798.0s)]
*  You have to listen before you can persuade and I think you're reflecting back frustration that I feel profoundly [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2801.08s)]
*  That I think a lot comes from the internet [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2807.8s)]
*  And the amplification of the worst voices on Twitter or other platforms, but congressman Smith [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2810.1200000000003s)]

*  Andrew wants to know assuming we make it through the next four years and we're still holding elections at that time [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2976.18s)]
*  Are you afraid that the next Democrat to get elected president will be hamstrung into keeping a lot of the government dismantling happening? [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2981.32s)]
*  Right now he's trying to rebuild basic functionality will be viewed as too expensive or intrusive outreach [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2987.14s)]

*  But you know what I I like the optimism. It's good. It's fun to think that I think they could be hamstrung [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=2998.82s)]
*  I [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3006.38s)]
*  Dan and I talked about this a little on Friday's pod [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3007.7s)]
*  Which is I think that the next Democratic president probably even when they're running is going to have to like issue a call for [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3011.18s)]
*  The best and brightest in every expert field and to join government again because [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3019.2599999999998s)]
*  Trump and Musk have taken a chainsaw [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3026.74s)]

*  They'll think to themselves. Oh if a Republican wins again, I could just like we're gone lose my job [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3035.98s)]
*  Like I think that the next Democratic president will be able to get fantastic [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3040.54s)]
*  Political appointees I think the Civil Service is gonna have to rebuild be rebuilt and it could hamstring the next [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3044.38s)]
*  Democratic president, but I also think that [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3051.06s)]
*  one potential benefit of Trump doing what he's done is [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3053.5s)]
*  He's showing what you can change and get away with [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3058.9s)]
*  Within the confines of the law or what the courts will allow [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3062.2200000000003s)]
*  Oftentimes outside the confines of law, but I'm sure there's a lot that he's doing that is actually gonna be legal [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3066.02s)]
*  Just that we might not want it wouldn't have done ourselves. So I think for the next Democratic president is going to be [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3070.7s)]
*  liberated in some senses of like reorganizing agencies and [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3077.46s)]
*  cabinets in a way that's gonna make government most effective for people [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3081.74s)]
*  Yeah, I've been think about this a lot [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3086.22s)]
*  I mean [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3087.8199999999997s)]
*  I don't want the next Democrat to feel like they need to just go back to the status quo before Trump like we shouldn't [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3088.1s)]
*  Just go back to [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3095.7799999999997s)]
*  USAID as it was and spend a ton of political capital trying to [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3097.2599999999998s)]
*  Just run it back like we need to reimagine what these agencies can look like how could we do it smarter? [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3103.06s)]
*  How can we be more efficient? I think there will be some challenges though because Trump is just [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3107.4199999999996s)]
*  throwing all Democrats out of what are supposed to be [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3113.14s)]
*  Nonpartisan boards or agencies or leadership positions and I think it is gonna start a tit-for-tat [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3116.54s)]
*  That is gonna be hard to put back in the tube, you know, and but we have to do it [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3123.06s)]
*  We can't let like these right-wing mega zealots [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3127.38s)]
*  Run the you know, I don't care about the Kennedy Center, but that's an example. Well, you and I were talking about this yesterday ice [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3131.74s)]
*  and look we went we went through the whole abolish ice cycle back in [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3138.1s)]
*  2017 18 [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3143.58s)]
*  But I do think that there are like a lot of these ice agents and we're hearing about this and these stories where people are [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3144.9s)]
*  getting detained and deported based on like, you know [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3151.38s)]
*  Misidentifying tattoos and bullshit like that's like these are probably some pretty partisan [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3155.7s)]
*  Pretty MAGA people that like a Democratic president is gonna have to like clean out that agency and rebuild it from scratch [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3161.06s)]
*  You're gonna have to clean house and it's gonna be hard because you're gonna have to give up some power [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3167.14s)]
*  Because there are independent agencies that Trump has now taken over and I think we should restore their independence [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3171.14s)]
*  Yes to a lot of these places [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3177.38s)]
*  Better governance right and our responsibility gene is gonna bite us in the ass once again, but it's the right thing to do [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3178.74s)]
*  But and I we might have said this but every year around the State of the Union [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3183.46s)]
*  There in the Obama administration. There was a proposal to like reorganize government somehow, right? [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3189.06s)]
*  And there was one to merge commerce and small business [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3194.46s)]
*  Administration there was one to merge education and labor right? And so it's not like [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3199.74s)]
*  Democrats are just against reorganizing and [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3205.02s)]
*  Making government more efficient because like we tried to do it and the problem was like we had two [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3208.18s)]
*  cabinet secretaries [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3213.94s)]
*  we want to get rid of one and [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3214.9s)]
*  Congress would have not gone along with it because everyone has their fiefdom and so there are obstacles like making government more efficient that he [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3216.14s)]
*  Might be clearing out of the way for us. So I'm not saying that like all government efficiency is bad [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3223.02s)]
*  So that that might help us but I do think just getting the the people in is gonna be really tough. Yeah [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3227.2999999999997s)]
*  Janice C 37 asks house concern. Should we be? [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3233.5s)]
*  About the conservative lean of Gen Z voters. I'll be honest. I'm quite concerned [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3237.62s)]
*  It's him because I think you or you your brain can get hardwired for your political views for the rest of your life [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3241.9s)]
*  When you're younger [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3248.1s)]
*  It's not really the issue isn't really Gen Z voters. It's Gen Z men [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3249.98s)]
*  We're seeing that in data here in the United States. The gender divide is massive among [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3256.3399999999997s)]
*  People under 30 the German elections that just happened there was a huge split among young people where you had [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3262.54s)]
*  Younger men going to the AFD which is the crazy far-right party and young women going to these leftist parties [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3269.3799999999997s)]
*  Whether it was the BSW or sort of like traditional [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3275.7799999999997s)]
*  communist adjacent parties [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3279.2999999999997s)]
*  None of them wanted the traditional Social Democrats or the contract traditional conservatives [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3281.74s)]
*  They all come hated the establishment in the status quo. So [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3286.7s)]
*  It's worrisome in so far as we are Democrats and we want the Democratic Party to get support from young people [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3290.62s)]
*  But also this young men problem is a real thing that needs to be addressed. It's a real thing. I think [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3297.1s)]
*  part of the problem is [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3303.06s)]
*  algorithmic this is where [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3305.54s)]
*  young people are spending more time on their phones and on their screens than any other generation that we all are and [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3308.38s)]
*  The algorithm is sending young men one place and young women another place [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3314.7s)]
*  So that's gonna make a bigger gender gap than older generations who are still getting more of their news from the same place [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3321.02s)]
*  Which is to say not on social media. So I think that's a challenge. I also think for a lot of these [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3326.62s)]
*  I saw somewhere there was a chart where [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3330.86s)]
*  Gen Z [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3334.5s)]
*  Kids who did not [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3336.5s)]
*  Spend their formative years in high school and college in the pandemic are still voting pretty [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3339.2999999999997s)]
*  Democratic and it was the younger gen Z's who had been stuck home [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3345.6600000000003s)]
*  During you know key years in high school and college that are the ones who were swinging the furthest to the right [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3350.6200000000003s)]
*  So I think the pandemic fucked a lot of people up. Yeah, still dealing with that [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3356.06s)]
*  I'd be real pissed too if I missed my senior year of high school or college or anything like that [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3359.26s)]
*  And I think it fucks you up in a specific way [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3363.82s)]
*  politically, which is not I'm gonna be more conservative in the traditional sense, but [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3366.3s)]
*  The more MAGA style of politics, which is the system sucks burn it all down [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3371.2200000000003s)]
*  I can't everyone has let me down, you know [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3375.86s)]
*  And I think rebuilding that trust with that generation is gonna be it's gonna be hard [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3378.38s)]
*  But I think that's sort of the task for Democrats. We gotta deliver for them [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3383.46s)]
*  Super skink asks are we pro dem tea party or against it right now with all the shit we are seeing I am super pro [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3387.78s)]
*  I feel like [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3395.82s)]
*  Dem tea party has gotten [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3398.5s)]
*  Become a shorthand for just upending the status quo within the party new leaders [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3401.46s)]
*  Not you know voicing the kind of traditional Democratic shibboleths not necessarily [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3407.6200000000003s)]
*  Gerontocracy is a big piece. Yes. I mean just know that like the the Republican Tea Party movement there was [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3413.3s)]
*  grassroots energy and enthusiasm behind it that helped the [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3419.34s)]
*  Republicans in the near term in the 2010 midterms, but was ultimately very destructive [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3423.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah for the party in the country people look back at the Tea Party and the Tea Party successes and say oh well [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3427.46s)]
*  You know, it's like it's a model but it was it was helpful for them in 2010 and a midterm electorate [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3432.66s)]
*  It wasn't helpful for them in 2012 [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3438.22s)]
*  No, in fact like Mitt Romney, I think was probably hobbled by the fact that he had to take [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3440.3399999999997s)]
*  positions in that primary that pulled him to the right towards the Tea Party or that he could then not [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3445.8199999999997s)]
*  Get out of when he was in the general election against Obama and and was [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3450.8599999999997s)]
*  Portrayed by us as more conservative than he was when he was governor of Massachusetts [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3455.38s)]
*  And I think that's thanks to the Tea Party. Absolutely. Look, I also think it's a case-by-case thing like it [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3459.54s)]
*  You know if you're gonna run against a Democrat [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3465.3399999999997s)]
*  In a primary go for it [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3468.06s)]
*  But like have a theory of the case of why you want to beat them did like if it's someone who voted [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3470.1s)]
*  If you're gonna make your whole race about they didn't vote to shut the government down [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3475.98s)]
*  And they wanted to vote for the CR like you can but I think in in 26 [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3480.62s)]
*  That's not gonna be a great basis for their campaign. What are you talking about? Right? So you sort of have to find other issues [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3486.54s)]
*  I think if you're a younger person running against an older person, that's generational change so you can do that [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3492.54s)]
*  So I do think it's case-by-case. Yeah [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3497.46s)]
*  Morgan [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3500.14s)]
*  L0975 asks are you finding yourself censoring some of the stuff you want to say or how far you want to go? [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3501.8199999999997s)]
*  Given the wider crackdown on media and honestly even for your own safety and that of your families interesting question [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3507.9s)]
*  I will say one of the great things about doing a podcast is you have to opt into it [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3514.36s)]
*  Mm-hmm. So we don't have a lot of like as many rage listeners [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3519.36s)]
*  Yeah [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3522.14s)]
*  It's when you go on Fox News or something goes viral [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3522.98s)]
*  Thanks to some right-wing person on social media clip or whatever. That's when you get [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3526.82s)]
*  attacked threatened [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3533.14s)]
*  Cursed at etc. So I think [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3535.14s)]
*  All people in media need to be aware that this is a very scary time in terms of defamation lawsuits [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3538.7799999999997s)]
*  Trump has said he wants to open up libel law and make it easier to sue people. We're seeing major corporations [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3546.02s)]
*  caving to Trump [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3551.62s)]
*  Facebook cut him a big check [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3553.62s)]
*  there's a report today about a major law firm that went at the Oval Office and [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3555.3799999999997s)]
*  Graveled and offered, you know, what is it 40 million dollars in pro bono services insane? [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3560.82s)]
*  Was it Paul Weiss all my firm don't know that guy. I think he's kind of a loser [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3565.82s)]
*  Do you know that it's actually two last names Paul and Weiss? Oh, yeah [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3569.82s)]
*  I I only got that when I was finally reading it this morning [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3573.78s)]
*  But you know, I don't know that I you haven't censored anything [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3578.54s)]
*  I don't sell sensor but some of this stuff's in the back of my mind. Yeah, it's there. It's in the back of my mind [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3581.42s)]
*  It's weird. I worry about it all the time, but it has not changed my behavior [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3587.2s)]
*  Like much like knowing your email could be hacked at any time. I'm still a moron. Yeah. Yeah [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3593.52s)]
*  So I you know, Emily doesn't love it when I get in fights with Elon Musk. She makes her makes her a little nervous [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3597.72s)]
*  But I don't know I think on the defamation thing [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3605.16s)]
*  I actually think that there's there's another silver lining in this and how it how it shapes your criticism [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3607.96s)]
*  which is like defamation is [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3614.7999999999997s)]
*  accusing someone of being something or doing something that [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3617.56s)]
*  you know, they can argue that they didn't do right and like do we really need to label people or [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3621.64s)]
*  You know raise rumors about Elon Musk doing this or Donald Trump doing this [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3628.52s)]
*  Like you don't need to do that to level a really persuasive critique about the person [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3632.48s)]
*  All you have to do is talk about what they're doing play footage of them talking, right? [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3638.48s)]
*  That's exactly and you can call them assholes if you want, right? [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3642.14s)]
*  Like you don't have to call them something that's debatable whether it's true or not, like that's just not necessary [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3645.56s)]
*  It's not politically necessary. It's less politically effective [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3649.64s)]
*  I think than actually just making a case against their policies and their behavior [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3652.48s)]
*  So, you know, it's a it's almost a good reminder that like we don't really need to call people all kinds of names just to make [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3656.52s)]
*  A devastating case, but we will yeah [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3663.38s)]
*  And it's also a good reminder that you know for public figures or elected officials the standard is far higher than commentary about [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3665.48s)]
*  Individual citizens and I think we focus on elected officials anyway [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3672.98s)]
*  John Nish coleslaw zero zero wants to know what are your favorite podcasts? [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3677.6600000000003s)]
*  Let's say non crooked media and newsletters that you look forward to consuming each week. Mm-hmm [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3683.06s)]
*  I read [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3688.54s)]
*  JVL's triad and the bulwark great one unlike Sarah. Yes, there's not [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3691.1400000000003s)]
*  I [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3695.86s)]
*  Listened to a lot of the bulwark pods. I listened to Ezra's pod. I listened to Kara Swisher's stuff [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3696.9s)]
*  Ezra's on a one-name basis for you like Madonna [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3702.7400000000002s)]
*  Carrie Swisher and Scott Galloway I listen to their stuff [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3710.3s)]
*  I really like hard fork. Yeah, Casey Newton [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3713.7400000000002s)]
*  and Kevin Roos over the New York Times I [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3718.06s)]
*  Happy to say that we talked about us having that show on our network and then they jilted us [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3721.86s)]
*  Dumped us and went for the New York Times [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3728.02s)]
*  I love Derek Thompson's pod plain English great great writer too. I love this show. Pardon my take. It's a martial sports show [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3731.02s)]
*  Newsletters, I don't know besides message box. I'm not like a huge [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3738.14s)]
*  newsletter consumer [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3742.34s)]
*  They go to my inbox and I forget to get to them. Yeah, I have them all flagged every morning [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3744.02s)]
*  thousand subsets that I [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3749.94s)]
*  Subscribe to and I have them all flagged like I'm gonna read them later [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3752.46s)]
*  And then I like I said, I read the message box and I read JVL and I sometimes read a few others, but it's hard [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3755.02s)]
*  Yeah, it is hard. There's a lot to read final question from that's Nick [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3760.82s)]
*  Can you share some thoughts on Gavin Newsom's podcast good bad or anything in between? [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3764.9s)]
*  We're first of all work in progress. He's had what two or three episodes? Yeah, I've listened to two [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3770.26s)]
*  I've not listened to Tim Walls [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3775.02s)]
*  I have no problem with him interviewing [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3777.1800000000003s)]
*  People on the right even the far right. I think the execution could use a lot of work [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3780.26s)]
*  We don't need a kind of wonky conversation with Steve Bannon about tariffs. We need to mix it up a little more push back [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3785.06s)]
*  Call him out on some of the fish yet. And again, I'm not saying this because like our liberal ears are offended by Steve talking. It's [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3790.38s)]
*  Well, I think what Gavin was really good at in the last couple of years is going on Fox and mixing it up [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3798.38s)]
*  Yeah and punching and counter punching and the same as his debate with the Santas [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3803.92s)]
*  I just want to see a little more that energy and less kind of [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3807.58s)]
*  Interview podcast energy well and some of what makes [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3810.82s)]
*  like fights on cable so awful is [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3814.7s)]
*  The format of television where it's like you get a sound bite [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3818.62s)]
*  You get a sound bite you're gonna yell at each other and then you're gonna go to commercial [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3821.78s)]
*  And I don't find that all that value anything but the whole beauty of a podcast is it's long enough that you can have [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3825.18s)]
*  like debates and tough conversations [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3833.98s)]
*  But you can do it with like nuance and not like I'm not looking for headlines out of Gavin's podcast or like [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3836.7799999999997s)]
*  Newsome slams [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3842.9s)]
*  destroys Bannon like that's not what I'm looking for, but I'm looking for like a real debate about [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3844.9s)]
*  Their differences and I think so far he has not really done that [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3850.7s)]
*  He's kind of just playing host and just listening to what the hosts that the what his guest says being polite [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3854.38s)]
*  Yeah, he's being polite, which I think you can be I think you can disagree and still be polite [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3859.74s)]
*  Disagree and still be polite, you know [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3864.54s)]
*  Like there's just not a lot of disagreeing and I kind of want a little more debate because that's just I think that's more interesting [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3866.3s)]
*  Yeah, and I in both of us have spent a bunch of time with Gavin Newsome off the record and he's like a super [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3871.54s)]
*  engaging funny [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3878.26s)]
*  Competitive very smart smart guy like facts and figures just fly out of his mouth all the time [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3880.26s)]
*  And so he's someone who actually I think could be really good at this format and probably will be [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3885.58s)]
*  We sucked at this job when we started [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3890.34s)]
*  Yeah, and I don't know like if when we started you put us on like a [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3892.98s)]
*  Interview with a Steve Bannon or someone on the right at the beginning. I think I would have been fucking horrible [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3897.58s)]
*  Yes, Steve Steve Bannon who I full disclosure. I've texted to try to get him to come on the show [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3901.7s)]
*  I'm still thinking about whether it would work [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3906.34s)]
*  But he's like a he's a professional propagandist. So he's gonna be someone who's very difficult to debate. Yeah, and it's challenging [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3908.74s)]
*  But I think it's a good skill to learn. It is a good skill to learn and it's good to mix it up [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3916.06s)]
*  I will say I am [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3919.58s)]
*  I'm looking for a venue for what you were just describing which is [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3922.46s)]
*  Conversations with people you disagree. I hate [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3927.7799999999997s)]
*  Debates, I don't like the debate format like the Jubilee stuff. It's interesting. Like Sam Cedar did a great job [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3930.34s)]
*  He did a great job. It was compelling. He's super smart. He's got all these facts like at the ready, but I don't [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3936.7999999999997s)]
*  Like I just I feel no desire to own someone [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3942.14s)]
*  Let alone 30 people I'd like to talk to someone who disagrees with me in a reasonable way and try to find [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3946.06s)]
*  Some common ground like I going greenwalled on Pod save the world the other day [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3951.74s)]
*  And I felt like the reaction from the audience was like you guys agreed too much [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3954.94s)]
*  I was like, well, I don't know Glenn's smart on the First Amendment. Yeah that when you're going into that because I've done this too [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3959.5s)]
*  it's like [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3966.46s)]
*  Either people are gonna think that you agree too much or they're gonna think like you didn't challenge [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3967.66s)]
*  The guest on a specific point that was important to them [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3972.2999999999997s)]
*  And I guess my advice would be if you're listening to these [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3975.12s)]
*  Like it's not all these conversations are not like for [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3978.18s)]
*  They're not gonna hit every point that everyone agrees on and when I'm sitting down with someone [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3982.4199999999996s)]
*  I'm like if if I could if I was talking to someone I disagreed with and I spent the whole time just fact-checking them [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3986.7799999999997s)]
*  That's not like really an interesting. You don't listen to that. You don't listen to that and guess what we can all fact-check them on [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3991.22s)]
*  The computer it's also really hard to look at our phone [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3996.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it's really hard to imagine you're in a conversation with your kid with your friend with a political opponent in real time [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=3999.3399999999997s)]
*  You're like taking in the information you're cataloging it you're finding in your mind why it's wrong and you're spitting back out like it's difficult to do [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=4004.72s)]
*  It is difficult to do and I think the more interesting conversation is not just calling out all the times [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=4011.0s)]
*  They're lying or exaggerating whatever but like getting to their worldview and then trying to pick apart that worldview if you disagree with it [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=4016.96s)]
*  Yeah, and I think if you can do that, then that's an interesting conversation for people. Yeah, it's valuable [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=4023.0s)]
*  All right, that is it for the QA. Thank you again to all the discord folks great questions great questions [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCmGXdu0nw&t=4028.12s)]
