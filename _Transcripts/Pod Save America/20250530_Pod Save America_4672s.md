Video Description: Donald Trump loses his cool when a reporter asks him about a newly popular Wall Street phrase: TACO, aka Trump Always Chickens Out. A federal court unanimously rules that the majority of Trump’s tariffs are illegal — before an appeals court allows them to remain in place (for now). And after 128 days of destruction, Elon Musk's time as a Special Government Employee officially comes to a close. Jon and Dan discuss the future of DOGE after Musk, check in on Trump’s ongoing war with Harvard University, and deliver a new Corrupt-date — this time on Trump’s clemency spree. Then, Jon talks to Liz Oyer, a former DOJ Pardon Attorney, about her MAGA successor’s very political approach to a historically nonpartisan job.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Elon Musk is OUT + Trump Loses His Sh*t Over Reporter Question
**Pod Save America:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0)
*  I also am hoping that less attention on Elon, who does consume quite a bit of attention, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=0.0s)]
*  means more attention on all the people who we can defeat in an election, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=6.8s)]
*  Republicans in Congress, who I feel like haven't been getting the attention they deserve from [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=12.96s)]
*  people because they have been just rubber stamping every single thing Trump does and basically just [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=17.2s)]
*  giving up all of their power to just be extensions of the White House staff. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=22.48s)]
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Jon Favreau. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=26.96s)]
*  I'm Dan Pfeiffer. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=29.36s)]
*  On today's show, we'll shed some tears over Elon's official White House departure, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  talk about Trump's push to kick international students out of the United States, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=34.72s)]
*  and dig into the President's latest pardon spree, which I'll get into more with the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=38.08s)]
*  Justice Department's former pardon attorney who was fired by Trump for not giving Mel Gibson [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=41.68s)]
*  his guns back, Liz Oyer. A sentence I never thought I would say, like many of the sentences [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  here on this show. But first, bad news for Trump's favorite economic policy, good news for everyone [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=53.44s)]
*  who doesn't like higher prices. Most of the President's tariffs were ruled illegal Wednesday [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=58.72s)]
*  night in a unanimous decision by a three-judge panel at the U.S. Court of International Trade, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=63.92s)]
*  including a Trump appointee. Not only did the court order an immediate pause on the tariffs, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=69.28s)]
*  Trump has to refund every American company that's already had to pay tariffs. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  The Trump administration immediately appealed the ruling, which led to an appeals court deciding [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=79.44s)]
*  that the tariffs can remain in effect while the case is being considered. So slight setback there. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=83.68s)]
*  The initial ruling came the very same day the President lost his shit when a reporter asked [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  him about a phrase that's become popular on Wall Street to describe his trade policy, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=94.56s)]
*  TACO, which stands for Trump Always Chickens Out. Here's a clip of that exchange. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=99.68s)]
*  This week, what's your response to that? I kick out. Oh, isn't that nice? Chicken out. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=113.68s)]
*  I've never heard that. You mean because I reduced China from 145 percent that I set down to 100 and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=119.76s)]
*  then down to another number. Six months ago, this country was stone cold dead. We had a dead country. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=126.64000000000001s)]
*  We had a country people didn't think it was going to survive. And you ask a nasty question like that. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=133.36s)]
*  It's called negotiation. You set a number but don't ever say what you said. That's a nasty question. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=138.32s)]
*  Go ahead. To me, that's the nastiest question. I like that he finally went just full biff from [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=144.64s)]
*  Back to the Future. Also that he immediately thought it meant kick out because that seems to be what he [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  does. Deport. Trump always deports. And he's like chicken out. I've never heard that. Oh yeah, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=157.44s)]
*  you've never heard chicken out. Yeah, no, of course. But then it dawns on him that he's been made fun [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  of and it hurts. It hurts. So it is important to note that this ruling doesn't apply to some [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=166.56s)]
*  tariffs including those on aluminum and steel and that there may be ways, we will not get into them, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=172.8s)]
*  don't worry, for the administration to get around the ruling by using other laws to implement [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=178.24s)]
*  tariffs. It's a complicated matter, Dan. That's not for this podcast. No, we're not going to bore [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=183.12s)]
*  you with that. You can go listen to Lovett talk about that when he talks about salt on some other [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=191.68s)]
*  podcast. With all that said, what is your reaction to the court ruling, which at the very least may [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=195.36s)]
*  save Trump from more taco jokes for the time being? Well, if it does nothing else, it's still a win. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=203.76000000000002s)]
*  I mean, I've been sort of waiting for this to happen. It's always been interesting that the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=211.60000000000002s)]
*  International Emergency Economics Powers Act, whose authority Trump has used for all these tariffs, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=217.44000000000003s)]
*  does not include the word tariff in it. It's not listed as one of the remedies that a president [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=221.28s)]
*  can undertake here. And that sort of just got lost in all of the tacos we've had since then. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=226.56s)]
*  And we've been sort of waiting for that. Because a lot of the things that Trump does, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=233.36s)]
*  the immediate thing is he has done something, a court will probably stop him because the thing he [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=237.12s)]
*  wants to do is stop by the Constitution or this explicit law or whatever else. This one was always [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=242.16s)]
*  the subtext of what was going on. And it's notable that it's finally happened. This is going to make [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=249.04s)]
*  its way to the Supreme Court, I assume, and they will render a judgment. But the short version of [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=252.95999999999998s)]
*  this now is more chaos. The chaos came from Trump's taco strategy. I'm so sick of saying there were [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  taco already. Tariffs on, tariffs off, tariffs on, tariffs off. Now you have the court involved. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=265.59999999999997s)]
*  What happens if you have brought products in in the 12 hours between the ruling on Wednesday night [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=272.0s)]
*  and the ruling on Thursday afternoon and not pay tariffs on them because you just brought a [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=277.2s)]
*  fuckton of iPhones over and got those in for free? So it's very chaotic because this is a short-term [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=281.76s)]
*  stay on the ruling where they figure out what's happening. I'd be surprised if they kept the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=288.56s)]
*  tariffs off as it whammed its way to the Supreme Court. But it's more uncertainty for businesses, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=294.24s)]
*  which is bad for the economy. Yeah. And the markets reacted positively, very positively, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=298.8s)]
*  as one can imagine. I wonder how they'll react tomorrow. This is Thursday that we're recording [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=305.2s)]
*  this. Once they find out that the tariffs are back on while the process goes to the Supreme Court. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=312.56s)]
*  I don't know. The Supreme Court, obviously quite a conservative majority. I don't know. It feels [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=322.56s)]
*  like there are a lot of free traders. I feel like there are some real traditional conservatives on [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=328.4s)]
*  that Supreme Court that might not like the trade war, but hard to say. There's also people who [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=332.32s)]
*  really like to, who believe very much that the executive has all the power, the president has [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=336.32s)]
*  all the power. Though this goes to the, it does go to the Alien Enemies Act question too, which is [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=343.04s)]
*  Trump just gets into office, declares everything an emergency when there is no obvious emergency [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=348.0s)]
*  or any emergency, and then tries to take a lot of moves that you're not supposed to take just based [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=352.64s)]
*  on this false pretext that there's an emergency. Yeah. It's interesting because this, it's not [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=358.72s)]
*  really an economic question for the court. It's a question of executive power and whether this [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=363.76000000000005s)]
*  use of this authority, which is not granted in law, oversteps his executive authority and it bridges [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=370.72s)]
*  Congress's. You do have free traders, but you also have people who believe, as you say, who believe [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=377.52000000000004s)]
*  in some version or something approximated the unitary executive theory that would suggest that [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=383.52000000000004s)]
*  they would give this to him. So this will be interesting. I tried to go to Twitter to find [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=388.56s)]
*  some good legal analysis and I discovered that they'd all moved to blue sky. Like all our favorite [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=394.16s)]
*  lawyers are on blue sky now. Did you go there? I did go there, yes. And there are mixed opinions [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=398.64s)]
*  about where this is going. Caroline Levitt in the briefing today sort of previewed, I think, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=404.96s)]
*  what their legal argument is going to be because someone asked, I think Peter Doocy asked, like, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=410.8s)]
*  well, Trump has a Republican Congress that usually does what he says. Like, why not just go have them [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=416.24s)]
*  pass the law if it's up to Congress to do it? And she basically said, well, they tried to pass [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=422.24s)]
*  something through the Senate to pause the tariffs and couldn't get enough votes. So that's that. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=428.24s)]
*  Congress declined to do anything and the courts have no role here. That's their position. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=435.92s)]
*  That's not like I said, I'm not a legal expert on blue sky or elsewhere, but that's not really how [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=441.12s)]
*  the Constitution works. Absence of action from one body means the person can do whatever they want. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=446.88s)]
*  If the vote fails, that's all you need. That's all you need. Of course, Stephen Miller's out there [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=452.64s)]
*  calling it judicial tyranny. They're using it as the whole. So I'm also wondering if they're going [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=457.36s)]
*  to take this as far as they can and then try to figure out a way to just go around the law as they [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=463.36s)]
*  have been around on immigration things. Trump's approval, let's talk about the politics on this. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=467.28s)]
*  Trump's approval was at its lowest over the last few months after he announced the retaliatory [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=472.15999999999997s)]
*  tariffs on Liberation Day. But the approval rating has been climbing in the last few weeks as he [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=477.91999999999996s)]
*  keeps going back to the taco bar. Sorry. Keep going, keep going. Get them all in. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=484.88s)]
*  Do you think this ruling could end up being good politics for Trump? Did this court save Trump from [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=493.12s)]
*  himself? I don't think having your signature policy pieces struck down by the court is ever [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=498.32s)]
*  great politics. It makes you look weak and ineffective over the course of time. If the courts [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=506.72s)]
*  were to rule that Trump did not have the authority to do these tariffs, that would probably help him [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=512.24s)]
*  politically in the same. It's sort of the legal equivalent of putting a cone around a dog's neck. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=517.84s)]
*  It keeps him prevents him from doing damage to himself by hurting the economy further with [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=522.1600000000001s)]
*  tariffs. I do think the fundamental political... As you look at 2026, if we are in a tariff sparked [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=528.48s)]
*  recession and prices are incredibly high because of Trump's tariffs, that would be incredibly bad [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=537.36s)]
*  for him. But even having said that, what has happened over the first 140 or so days here is [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=540.96s)]
*  the way Trump has done the tariffs has undermined the central premise of his presidency. This idea [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=549.1999999999999s)]
*  that he was a... No matter what else you thought of him, that he was an able manager of the economy, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=553.28s)]
*  you have seen that come down significantly. Even if his approval ratings has gone up a little bit, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=558.0s)]
*  it's reaching just still historically bad for a president at this point in their term. It's not [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=562.8s)]
*  getting hot anywhere near where you would expect it to be in a typical honeymoon period. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=568.88s)]
*  But I think there has been real damage done by the tariffs. That damage will linger no matter [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=573.76s)]
*  what else the court does between now and then. Right. Crucially, tariffs are no tariffs. Prices [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=580.8s)]
*  have not come down. Inflation has come down, but prices haven't really come down. It's not like [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=585.4399999999999s)]
*  he's been getting excellent economic news anyway. Yes, chances of recession, if these tariffs stay [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=591.1999999999999s)]
*  off, certainly go down. But people's feelings about the economy, which going into Trump's term, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=596.32s)]
*  were already... There were a lot of concerns about prices and costs. Those don't go away, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=604.08s)]
*  nor does his only signature piece of legislation that he's trying to pass through Congress do [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=610.6400000000001s)]
*  anything about that. In fact, it makes it worse for a lot of people. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=616.96s)]
*  Yeah. For the people who need the most help, it raises their prices. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=619.36s)]
*  Yeah. In other good news, the White House's biggest doge bag has finally left the building. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=622.88s)]
*  Elon Musk, my good friend and mentor, announced on his platform that his time as a special [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=629.36s)]
*  government employee has officially come to a close after 128 days where he destroyed vital [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=635.36s)]
*  government services and his reputation, while saving taxpayers just under 8% of the $2 trillion [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=640.88s)]
*  in spending he originally promised to cut. But don't worry, the Trump White House's own [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=648.16s)]
*  Cato Kaelin is going to be coming back and popping into meetings once in a while, so he's not gone [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=653.8399999999999s)]
*  for good. He has also said that, quote, the doge mission will only strengthen as it becomes a way [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=658.7199999999999s)]
*  of life throughout the government. Where did the Cato Kaelin reference come from here? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=666.64s)]
*  He's been sleeping at the White House. He's just been... [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=672.3199999999999s)]
*  No, I know what it means. It's like a 1994... [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=675.2s)]
*  Well, in my mind, I'm thinking of those stories that he was sleeping in the EEOB. He's got a [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=681.0400000000001s)]
*  sleeping bag on the floor and he won't leave. And the cabinet's like, this guy, we've had enough of [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=687.76s)]
*  him, but he still won't leave. That's the houseguest. When you say houseguest who won't leave, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=692.4000000000001s)]
*  and you grew up when we grew up, you think Cato Kaelin? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=696.4000000000001s)]
*  Okay. All right. I buy it. It is correct. I was surprised to read it today. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=698.48s)]
*  And I have to insert a reference in every pod that the 35er underset doesn't really understand, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=704.4s)]
*  so that's important. This one is for the 40er under, it's pretty close. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=709.76s)]
*  Anyway, what do you think? Will doge become a way of life? Has doge become a way of life? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=715.36s)]
*  Isn't it already? Don't you wake up every day and pray to the doge god? You're wearing your doge [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=721.28s)]
*  gear. Yeah, no, I'm not sure. Doge will not be a way of life for me. I don't know about you. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=726.64s)]
*  What do you think is next for doge? Do you think this is going to be something we forget about? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=732.96s)]
*  I know there's a doge package of cuts that's apparently heading to Congress. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=736.5600000000001s)]
*  They're going to theoretically and reportedly send up some cuts for Congress to enact and put into [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=742.0s)]
*  law. They're doing that somewhat reluctantly. They've basically been bullied by the doge bros [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=747.84s)]
*  online into doing this. But doge as we know it, I think it's toast. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=752.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. It's just this effort- [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=758.8s)]
*  Just lives on in our hearts. Yeah, we won't forget it. We will always [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=763.12s)]
*  know where we were the day the doge started and the day doge ended. We will think fondly of our [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=767.12s)]
*  time with doge. But Elon Musk had the ability, he did it in the least effective, most chaotic way [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=772.7199999999999s)]
*  possible, but because he was someone with real political capital, a massive media platform in [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=782.0799999999999s)]
*  the ear of the president, he was able to end run the cabinet secretaries and make some of these [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=788.0s)]
*  cuts. Most of them got upended by the courts, but he was able to do things that are not going to be [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=793.44s)]
*  possible with some flunky in charge of the program now. I just don't see it having any [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=798.4s)]
*  the same impact that it had in the first hundred or so days. The guy originally said he was going [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=805.92s)]
*  to be able to cut $2 trillion. Then he revised that down to $1 trillion. Now he says that he cut [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=811.28s)]
*  about around $165-175 billion. That number is what Elon Musk says. Reporters have dug into that as [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=820.72s)]
*  much as they can and found that some of that money is counted twice some of its contracts that had [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=829.8399999999999s)]
*  already been canceled when Elon got there. So it's probably less than $165 billion. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=834.96s)]
*  They are sending a package of doge cuts to Congress for Congress to codify to pass so that [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=841.12s)]
*  they're there for good. That is only $9 billion. So now we're down to $9 billion. The package [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=846.64s)]
*  that they are trying to pass, the one big beautiful bill, is going to add about $4 trillion to the [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=856.72s)]
*  deficit. So $9 billion, that's a lot less, Dan. I see you trying to do that math in your head. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=862.88s)]
*  It's about 0.25% I believe of $4 trillion. Did you do that? Just write that in there? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=870.72s)]
*  I did. I did. Okay, well we'll check that later. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=877.4399999999999s)]
*  I don't know. I'm not the math major host on Plot.com. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=879.6s)]
*  Neither am I. Neither am I. It is true that he cut a lot less than he said, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=884.24s)]
*  but actually the cuts he did are probably going to end up costing the government money [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=888.88s)]
*  because he made things so much more inefficient and he cut the IRS, which is going to now collect [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=892.64s)]
*  less in taxes and allow more people to cheat on their taxes. So in the end, for all of the [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=899.3599999999999s)]
*  excitement, the chainsaws, the weird hats, the weird press conferences, the attention, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=906.64s)]
*  Elon Musk ended up costing the government more. He increased the deficit through his own [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=912.16s)]
*  ineffective distance stupidity. Yeah, a couple of other items he's [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=916.7199999999999s)]
*  going to be able to put on his resume that are under the Doge section. He closed a bunch of [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=919.76s)]
*  social security offices around the country. He tried to change how you call social security [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=926.72s)]
*  office for help and basically screwed a bunch of seniors who were trying to make calls and they [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=934.0s)]
*  couldn't get through anymore because he had to walk that back, all the changes to social security, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=939.04s)]
*  so he fucked that one up. There were a bunch of layoffs at after school programs [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=944.3199999999999s)]
*  that he tried to cut. We're still dealing with a bunch of FEMA cuts as we head into hurricane [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=949.12s)]
*  season, so that's something he can be proud of. This is from Reuters from just a few weeks ago. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=955.1999999999999s)]
*  Food rations that could supply 3.5 million people for a month are rotting in warehouses around the [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=961.36s)]
*  world because of USAID cuts. These food rations could feed over a million people for three months. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=968.56s)]
*  So that's just a great example of government efficiency there because US taxpayers have [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=977.68s)]
*  already paid for the food, but then they fed USAID into a woodchipper, which he was quite proud of, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=983.28s)]
*  and now the food is rotting places all around the country that could, all around the world, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=989.28s)]
*  that could feed millions of people. So that's another thing he did. 1.6 million people [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=994.0799999999999s)]
*  could die within a year because we cut HIV prevention and treatment. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1000.7199999999999s)]
*  Nick Kristof from the New York Times, he actually traveled to Africa because Elon was going around [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1004.8000000000001s)]
*  saying, what do you mean people have died? No one's died. That's a liberal exaggeration. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1010.48s)]
*  It's hysterical, blah, blah, blah. And sure enough, Kristof went to a bunch of different [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1014.96s)]
*  places in Africa and found that people are dying right now because they've lost the funding from [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1019.2800000000001s)]
*  USAID. Kids are dying of hunger, tuberculosis, polio. Those are all threats now that people [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1024.96s)]
*  have to worry about again. This was from The Guardian yesterday. A 43-year-old woman and [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1032.88s)]
*  mother of two with advanced cancer is experiencing life or death delays in treatment because of NIH [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1038.48s)]
*  cuts. So here at home, if you don't care about people dying all over the world for absolutely [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1045.2800000000002s)]
*  no reason because we could keep them alive on pennies a day, we have a bunch of people here [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1050.8000000000002s)]
*  who are counting on cancer treatments and other medical treatments who are not be able to get them [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1055.6000000000001s)]
*  now because we have cut medical research in some of the world's best medical research institutions [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1061.04s)]
*  here in the United States. So that's what Elon can be proud of. That's his legacy. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1068.3999999999999s)]
*  Does great work all the way around. How do you think the Elon [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1072.8s)]
*  rehabilitation tour is going to go? You think he's going to be able to rehab his image? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1076.96s)]
*  I do not, Sean. I think no amount of rehabilitation is going to help his image. I think he has done [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1081.44s)]
*  permanent damage to his image. He might be able to recoup some of the shareholder value of Tesla's [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1086.0s)]
*  other companies by being less public and cutting less cancer research and maybe showing up to work [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1092.32s)]
*  every once in a while. But in the end, the damage to Musk himself and to Tesla and the other [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1099.9199999999998s)]
*  companies I think is pretty close to permanent. It is just a notable thing when your customer base [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1105.12s)]
*  feels a need to put a bumper sticker that says, fuck Elon on the back of the car from the company [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1111.76s)]
*  you own. Also, what in his recent history has shown he would have the self-discipline [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1116.48s)]
*  to stay quiet and help his image? He's going to be going through withdrawal here very quickly. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1125.04s)]
*  He was the center of the universe for over a year. Heading back in the 2024 campaign, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1132.16s)]
*  he's out on the campaign trail. He's got his black mega hats on. He's in the Oval Office the whole [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1137.52s)]
*  time. He's doing press conferences. He is in the center of attention. He loves attention. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1142.0s)]
*  His tweets are driving their... He was killing legislation with his tweets and appointments [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1147.2s)]
*  with his tweets. Now he's just going to be tweeting about the latest features in a Tesla [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1152.48s)]
*  car or the latest SpaceX launch. I just find that hard to believe. He's going to stay away [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1158.56s)]
*  from the controversy of politics. I'll be looking forward to the first profile that's done [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1162.08s)]
*  in a month or two about how Elon's feeling and how he's been a little depressed since he's [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1166.96s)]
*  been out of Washington and all that and what his next moves are. I agree with you that it seems [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1171.3600000000001s)]
*  hard to believe that he's just going to stay out of the spotlight after this. He was so thirsty [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1176.5600000000002s)]
*  for attention, he spent $45 billion to buy Twitter. He sure did. He sure did. Boy, was that a worthwhile [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1180.8000000000002s)]
*  purchase. One important legacy from Elon is the work he did to help keep a liberal majority on [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1186.0800000000002s)]
*  the Wisconsin Supreme Court by making his polarizing self central to that Supreme Court [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1192.24s)]
*  race in Wisconsin. Do you think Democrats will miss having Elon around as a punching bag? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1199.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, probably. Elon Musk, the world's richest man, being in charge of an effort to [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1205.1200000000001s)]
*  cut food assistance to poor people, cancer research, firing federal employees, was the [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1211.68s)]
*  perfect metaphor for the plutocratic cruelty that is Donald Trump's Republican Party. It was perfect [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1218.08s)]
*  and it was used to great efficacy in Wisconsin. You could see that happening everywhere. It's a [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1226.96s)]
*  very mobilizing thing for Democrats when the world's richest man is trying to buy elections, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1232.48s)]
*  as he tried to do in 2024 and he really tried to do it in Wisconsin. It was a great gift to Democrats [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1236.1599999999999s)]
*  that Trump appointed one of the world's most famous people, someone with an amazing ability [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1240.8s)]
*  to get attention, to implement a series of really, really, really unpopular policies. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1245.84s)]
*  Normally, if you want to do things like cut food assistance or cancer research or food safety [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1251.36s)]

*  attention from every single thing they do was a huge gift. It's sort of like if you want to rob a [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1265.84s)]
*  bank, you probably don't want to hire Kim Kardashian as your getaway driver. It's like, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1270.6399999999999s)]
*  and so that was a gift to Democrats. We're not going to have that going forward, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1276.24s)]
*  but the underlying arguments that we use in Wisconsin without Elon Musk's name still are [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1280.3999999999999s)]

*  I also am hoping that less attention on Elon, who does consume quite a bit of attention, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1290.0s)]
*  means more attention on all the people who we can defeat in an election, Republicans in Congress, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1296.8s)]
*  who I feel like haven't been getting the attention they deserve from people because they have been [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1304.16s)]

*  debating this bill for the next month or so, it's a good opportunity to make sure people know that [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1320.48s)]
*  it is the Republicans in Congress who have quite a bit of power that they are using to screw people. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1326.16s)]
*  Do you think this is, I'm taking this on a diversion here for a second, but do you think [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1331.28s)]
*  as we head into 2026, the more energy should be spent on Trump and what he's doing with this bill [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1336.8s)]
*  or on the individual Republican, the House Republicans who are voting for it? [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1345.76s)]
*  I think it's both. I think you've got to tie them together in a way that we have not tied them [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1350.1599999999999s)]
*  together yet. I think individually, I mean, individual races, obviously they're going to have [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1354.08s)]
*  the person you're running against, but I think Donald Trump and Republicans control Washington [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1358.48s)]
*  together and they are in lockstep that no Republicans have broken from them. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1364.1599999999999s)]
*  This is what they're doing. This is the damage they're causing and Congress has basically, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1369.28s)]
*  Congress is an extension of the White House staff. I think that's the best way to do it, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1374.3999999999999s)]
*  but I don't know. What do you think? I don't know. The House races are going to rise and fall [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1380.72s)]
*  together. None of these members are so important. They're like, oh, I have such a personal [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1387.36s)]

*  The way our electoral coalition works, as we talked about last week when we talked about the [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1404.3999999999999s)]
*  catalyst data is we want midterm turnout. We don't want anything above midterm turnout. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1407.6s)]
*  Right. Trump has potential to turn people out. I don't know the answer to it yet, but [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1412.56s)]
*  there's no question that it can't be just Trump. It's got to be Trump and Republicans. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1421.84s)]
*  That's also just playing the long-term game of presuming Trump doesn't upend the Constitution [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1428.8s)]
*  and engage in a military coup between now and 2028. We're going to run against a Republican [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1432.88s)]
*  who's not that old Trump in 2028. We need the bad stuff of Trump to infect the rest of the party. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1438.24s)]
*  That's why I brought it up originally because I do think that is a task that we have not [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1444.48s)]
*  focused on as much. I think also just thermostatic public opinion, people, voters who don't play [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1449.1200000000001s)]
*  close attention, but who do turn out in midterms just think to themselves, oh, Trump's doing a [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1455.84s)]
*  bunch of bad shit. We got to have a check on Trump right now. It's full Republican control [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1459.76s)]

*  college in the United States because this is the best place to get an education. It is a cultural [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1874.32s)]
*  centerpiece of the world, an educational centerpiece of the world. Many of those that best and the [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1879.68s)]
*  brightest, they go to college here, they stay here, they work in American companies and most importantly, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1883.2s)]
*  they start American companies. Google, eBay, YouTube, NVIDIA, all huge. Tesla. Tesla as one, yes. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1888.0s)]
*  SpaceX. SpaceX. All companies that employ huge amounts of Americans have generated tons of wealth [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1896.48s)]
*  have been some of the most innovative companies in the world started in America by immigrants who [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1904.24s)]
*  came here to go to college. Now, if you were going to go elsewhere, they're going to go to college [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1908.0s)]
*  elsewhere, they're going to start companies elsewhere. It's a huge brain drain for the United [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1912.64s)]
*  States. It's one of the most self-defeating things we could possibly do. It just fundamentally [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1917.8400000000001s)]
*  misunderstands what our strength is as a nation. Where we lead the world is in innovation and we [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1922.48s)]
*  are going to make that... Trump is basically running an anti-innovation agenda. It's not just [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1930.96s)]
*  keeping these, kicking these kids out of school. It's also cutting the research that you're talking [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1936.24s)]
*  about. I just was reading this for a day about how China is now leading the world in drug trials. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1940.08s)]
*  They're beating us in that game because we... And we're going to make that easier because of what [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1945.76s)]
*  Donald Trump's doing. I just wrote a story. We're losing doctors to Canada. Doctors are starting to [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1949.68s)]
*  leave to go to Canada because they don't want to be in the United States anymore because of everything [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1953.92s)]
*  R.F.K. Junior's doing, because of Trump's cuts to NIH, because of everything, and it's just easier [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1958.72s)]
*  to go somewhere else. Students in the academic year 2023-2024 academic year, international students [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1962.48s)]
*  contributed $44 billion to the U.S. economy, supported 378,000 jobs. That's just the students [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1971.1200000000001s)]
*  before they go off and start companies, just because of all the research they do. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1977.76s)]
*  International students comprise 5% of higher ed enrollment in this country. And the thing is they [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1982.48s)]
*  are heavily, heavily concentrated in graduate programs. So this isn't even a big undergraduate [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1990.48s)]
*  thing. This is they're in graduate programs and they are especially in graduate programs [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=1995.84s)]
*  around subjects like engineering, computer science, research. And we also have a situation in the [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2000.96s)]
*  country where college application rates, not like acceptance rates, application rates are falling [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2007.28s)]
*  among U.S. students. So if you have those falling, basically what you have is a lot of graduate [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2013.6s)]
*  programs in the STEM areas, in science and math and engineering, all those very important areas. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2018.8s)]
*  And U.S. colleges can't really fill those slots. It's not because it's so competitive and all the [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2024.08s)]
*  international students get into the U.S. student union. That's not happening. It is they need [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2029.68s)]
*  international students to fill those slots and without them. And by the way, international students [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2034.24s)]
*  also tend to pay full tuition. That's another thing that we're getting from international students. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2038.4s)]
*  And because they pay full tuition, that allows these colleges to help subsidize their operations, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2044.32s)]
*  their staff and financial aid for American students. So if we kick out all the international students [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2049.84s)]
*  who are paying full freight to college, that's going to mean more cuts to colleges. That's [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2057.52s)]
*  probably going to mean higher tuition for other students. And that's going to mean less students [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2061.52s)]
*  being able to go. It's so dumb. There is no purpose to what is happening here. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2065.2s)]
*  I was yelling about this, but JD fucking Vance, he posts this long tweet over the weekend and he's [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2073.04s)]
*  like, here's the deal with the Trump administration's policy towards universities. There is a [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2080.56s)]
*  reproducibility crisis where published papers from research universities fail to replicate [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2086.88s)]
*  and turn into commercial adoption. And so basically all this research is being done is not [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2093.84s)]
*  generating enough jobs and businesses. And that's a problem with these elite institutions. And also [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2099.2000000000003s)]
*  all of these professors, their voting patterns, it's like North Korea. All they do is just vote [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2104.88s)]
*  for liberal vote for Democrats. And also there's racial discrimination against whites and Asians. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2109.44s)]
*  And these are the problems that President Trump is looking to change. And if he would only, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2115.36s)]
*  if the colleges would only work with Trump to change these policies, instead of just yelling [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2120.08s)]
*  fascism, then we could be all better off. And so could the colleges be better off. And that's what [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2125.12s)]
*  this is really about. It's about, he said, basic democratic accountability. So he gives this long, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2130.48s)]
*  this long bullshit intellectual argument for why Trump's doing this. And then the next day [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2135.04s)]
*  Trump gets off the plane and a reporter asked him why he's doing this. And he's like, too many [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2139.6s)]
*  foreign students at Harvard, too many. Some of them could be terrorists, too many. We got to [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2142.8s)]
*  watch them. They could be some bad people. And it's like, okay, well, there you go, JD Vance. Yeah, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2147.92s)]
*  you can do your reproducibility crisis, but Donald Trump just thinks there's too many [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2151.84s)]
*  foreigners in our colleges. That's it. What a sad existence to JD Vance. So fucking sad. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2155.44s)]
*  He goes out there, he tries to, he twists himself into a fucking pretzel to try to justify [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2162.0s)]
*  his entirely new set of beliefs that he's just adopted for the purposes of [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2168.3199999999997s)]
*  acquiring power and to somehow make Trump seem less like a fucking moron. And then every day Trump [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2172.08s)]
*  goes out just acts like a fucking moron and in doing so makes JD Vance look weak and dumb and [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2177.2s)]
*  like a fucking moron. Yep. And it's, you know, it's all the, all the tech bros, the oligarchs, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2182.4s)]
*  the Elon Musk's, the all in crew and their podcasts. When, when Trump went on the all in podcast [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2187.12s)]
*  and was like, I'm really for, you know, stapling a green card to the diplomas of international [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2191.84s)]
*  students who come here for college. And the all in guys are like, see Trump's really much more [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2198.2400000000002s)]
*  moderate on immigration. What a great thing. And it was a fucking bullshit the whole time. No one [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2201.92s)]
*  believed that that was Donald Trump's actual position. And now not only is he not stapling [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2205.84s)]
*  a green card to their diploma, he's kicking them all out of the fucking country. And it's not even [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2210.4s)]
*  just like future students who may come here. There are students who were here, Chinese students. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2214.96s)]
*  What about Marco Rubio is going to fucking revoke visas from Chinese students? We have 275,000 [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2219.84s)]
*  Chinese students in this country. And he's just going to take their visa away for what? [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2225.04s)]
*  For what? Because they're tied to the Chinese Communist Party, meaning they're from China. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2229.52s)]
*  Right. Yeah. From that's yeah, they're from China. It's also fucking incoherent that it is like hard [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2233.6000000000004s)]
*  to take because we are, we're going to kick out students who might have ties to the Chinese [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2239.52s)]
*  Communist Party, but we are going to bend the law to allow the Chinese Communist Party's [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2244.0s)]
*  social video app to exist for as long as humanly possible. You can have an opinion on the TikTok [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2249.68s)]
*  ban. You can have an opinion on it, but your opinions have to at least have some sort of [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2256.0s)]
*  ideological coherence. You can say we're in a giant race to compete with China and we want, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2258.72s)]
*  we don't want China to be the way it is, but we're not going to allow other students to come here [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2264.16s)]
*  and be culturally acclimated to the United States and go back there. And we're also going to be in [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2267.68s)]
*  a race with China and we're going to gut all of our innovation initiatives to allow China to get [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2272.3999999999996s)]
*  the head start on things like solar and wind and green energy and all that. It's so stupid. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2275.84s)]
*  Well, then JD Vance is very upset that admissions policies are discriminating against [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2280.6400000000003s)]
*  Asian students. And so the best way to rectify that is to make sure that the largest group of [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2285.76s)]
*  Asian students in this country who are international Chinese students, actually the largest group of any [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2292.08s)]
*  ethnicity who's in this country is international students, we're going to kick them all out. So [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2296.96s)]
*  it all works out. It all works out. JD Vance grew up the way he grew up in Appalachia, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2301.28s)]
*  gets into an Ivy league college, succeeds because of it through, while sacrificing a lot of his [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2307.1200000000003s)]
*  dignity and morals and the above, and then burns the fucking bridge behind him. Yeah. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2312.5600000000004s)]
*  All right. In a moment, I'm going to talk to Liz Oyer, who's the DOJ's former pardon attorney about [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2318.4s)]
*  Trump's latest pardon spree. But before we do, I thought we would talk a little bit about the [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2323.84s)]
*  political implications of those pardons in another corrupt date. Corrupt date. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2328.24s)]
*  There you go. That's sweet. Asking ye shall receive. Complained that there was no- [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2340.9599999999996s)]
*  Yes, you ask a thousand times and one time you will get it. The truth is you have to ask publicly [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2344.64s)]
*  on a podcast if you want to know. I did, but you know what? Elijah came up with that sting [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2349.68s)]
*  really fast, right away. Yeah, it's great. So that's what we got. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2353.6s)]
*  Now we are Trump's toast now. This is the thing. This is it. This did him in. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2356.56s)]
*  So this week, Trump and his new pardon flunky, Nazi simp Ed Martin, extended pardons and [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2360.08s)]
*  commutations to at least 25 people among them. Former reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2366.2400000000002s)]
*  who were convicted of tax evasion and defrauding banks out of over $30 million, [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2372.88s)]
*  but are also huge Trump supporters. Also former Congressman Michael Grimm, who was also convicted [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2377.28s)]
*  of tax fraud. A former Virginia sheriff who then became a minor MAGA celeb who was caught on video [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2383.68s)]
*  accepting bags of cash caught on video over $75,000 worth of bribes that he got for making wealthy [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2390.3999999999996s)]
*  businessmen, deputy sheriffs with no training. They paid him money. He gave them a badge. There [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2399.2799999999997s)]
*  was no training. They gave him a bag of cash. They caught it on video, but he's MAGA, doesn't [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2408.32s)]
*  like immigrants. So he gets the pardon. But my personal favorite is Paul Walczak, a convicted [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2413.76s)]
*  tax cheat who pleaded guilty to tax evasion and fraud, but received a pardon after his mom, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2419.44s)]
*  a major Trump fundraiser, recently attended that $1 million a plate dinner at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2426.8s)]
*  The best part, she made sure to include the fact that she's a major Trump donor [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2433.44s)]
*  in the application for clemency, which was of course granted. And guess what? Now Walczak [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2438.0s)]
*  doesn't have to pay over $4 million in restitution to the people he screwed. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2445.84s)]
*  What do you make of this clemency spree? Seems pretty corrupt. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2451.1200000000003s)]
*  The Walczak one, they're all bad. That's why it's in the corrupt section, Dan. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2456.32s)]
*  That is aptly- Well, now everyone will know where it is because we finally have the sound [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2458.8s)]
*  that proves it. We did the right thing here. Yeah. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2463.28s)]
*  All Trump's doing is just pardoning his political cronies and financial supporters. That's what's [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2465.84s)]
*  happening here. And we're all just fine with it. The Walczak one is fucking perfect. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2470.7200000000003s)]
*  Just goes to the dinner. She put the bribe in the application [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2476.6400000000003s)]
*  and got the pardon. And look, this is... We've talked about [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2483.04s)]
*  Trump's corruption and how it's out in the open and whether it's an effective political [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2487.52s)]
*  message and whether it's really going to piss people off. And I would bet that a lot of people [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2492.08s)]
*  aren't necessarily surprised that Trump's going to abuse the pardon power and abuse his office [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2497.6s)]
*  to help his friends and cronies. But the situation with Walczak is extra infuriating because he [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2503.12s)]
*  ripped off a bunch of people. He withheld more than $10 million from the paychecks of these [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2511.04s)]
*  people who worked at his facilities, nurses, doctors, et cetera. And so he stole money [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2516.96s)]
*  from people who worked for him. He used some of the money to buy a $2 million yacht and then [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2522.88s)]
*  gave a million dollars through his mom to Donald Trump, got a pardon, and now he doesn't have to [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2530.48s)]
*  pay the money back, which he was going to have to do. So he committed a crime, screwed over a [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2537.04s)]
*  bunch of working class people who were at his facilities, and now he gets off and those people [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2541.6s)]
*  get screwed. And if that doesn't make you mad, if you think that's okay and good for Donald Trump, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2546.56s)]
*  great, you've got your president. But that's pretty fucked up. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2553.68s)]
*  There is just something about that pardon in particular. They're all bad. I've assumed one of [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2557.6s)]
*  them are bad. There's something about that pardon in particular that just speaks to the depraved [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2563.76s)]
*  world in which we live, where it's just like, that was a story. New York Times wrote a great [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2570.1600000000003s)]
*  story about it, read lots of stories about it. No one cares. Nothing happened. In a different world, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2573.44s)]
*  we've been doing a lot of 90s reference in this pod. But on his way out the door, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2578.88s)]
*  Bill Clinton pardoned Mark Rich, a financier. Mark Rich's wife, Denise Rich, had donated money [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2582.96s)]
*  to Bill Clinton, had been a fundraiser. Rich himself had been a big fundraiser. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2588.48s)]
*  It was a national scandal for weeks. In a normal world, what would happen with his [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2593.28s)]
*  Wellzak pardon is, because it looks like bribery. Can a court prove that it was bribery? I don't know. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2599.68s)]
*  But by the definition of bribery, in a dictionary, this is bribery. And the attorney general, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2609.36s)]
*  who would be an independent figure, would appoint a special counsel to look into it, [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2615.44s)]
*  and then determine what communications happened between Wellzak's mom and Trump aides to explain, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2620.16s)]
*  to do the quid pro in the quo in this. And none of that's happening. We're just going to move on. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2626.4s)]
*  We're going to get to this in the next topic, but it is pure pay to play in Trump's White House. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2635.2000000000003s)]
*  Then there would be impeachment hearings, most likely. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2640.4s)]
*  I know we're not supposed to- [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2643.76s)]
*  There would. And then Trump's approval rating would go up, and it would be terrible. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2644.5600000000004s)]
*  Can we just stick with the conviction? Or we would get convicted, then he could be able to [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2649.36s)]
*  run for a third term. But point being, there should be a fucking investigation somewhere, [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2652.0s)]
*  somehow, about some of this stuff. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2655.36s)]
*  I talked about this with Liz Oyer in our interview a bit, but what really gets me about this is the [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2657.6800000000003s)]
*  financial corruption around the pardons. But remember, he pardoned all of the January 6th [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2662.88s)]
*  rioters, many of whom were convicted of assaulting police officers, journalists, [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2669.7599999999998s)]
*  and really badly? They're all free now. And by the way, he frees those people. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2675.8399999999997s)]
*  One who was convicted of assaulting a police officer has been convicted again of soliciting [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2683.44s)]
*  a minor online. Another who was convicted of assaulting a police officer was convicted after [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2689.6s)]
*  released by Trump, after this person was released by Trump, of sexually assaulting a minor. Another, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2696.08s)]
*  also convicted of assaulting a police officer, freed by Trump, has been convicted of reckless [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2703.52s)]
*  homicide after drunk driving. So these are people, these are criminals that Donald Trump freed, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2710.08s)]
*  who should not have been freed because they violently assaulted police officers and journalists. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2716.4s)]
*  And the broader implication here is if you are a foot soldier for Donald Trump, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2722.08s)]
*  whether you're a January 6th rioter, whether you're a law enforcement official, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2729.28s)]
*  if you do his bidding, if he orders you to hurt someone, to kill someone, to commit crimes, [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2733.36s)]
*  you know that you're going to get a pardon. You know that you're going to get a commutation if [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2739.92s)]
*  you go to jail. And so what message does that send to people who want to commit crimes in [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2743.84s)]
*  Donald Trump's name? It tells them that it's fucking fine. Yeah, it's a very clear message. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2749.12s)]
*  Go commit crimes on my behalf. And I know that this, like the January 6th thing happened, [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2753.2s)]
*  the pardons happened on January 6th and it didn't really stick with voters and it wasn't like what [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2758.96s)]
*  made voters the angriest about Trump and his approval rating is still where it is. But like, [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2762.72s)]
*  I don't know, if you're sitting around in your community and there's a bunch of like, [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2766.8s)]
*  MAGA crazies who want to commit violence, I'd be worried. I think that's something that actually [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2770.96s)]
*  affects voters. It affects most people in this country that we're going to have a country full [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2777.12s)]
*  of people who just know that it's okay to commit crimes in the president's name if they're rich, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2780.88s)]
*  or if they're Trump supporters, or if they're rich Trump supporters. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2785.68s)]
*  This is where a little bit of the media disparity comes into play. And I know that this one about [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2788.7999999999997s)]
*  autism is could be very frustrating, but I think it's important, like these examples are illustrative [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2795.2799999999997s)]
*  to make a larger point about how the media world works and how we're getting outgunned. Imagine a [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2799.2799999999997s)]
*  world in which Joe Biden had pardoned some Black Lives Matter protesters who had been [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2804.24s)]
*  certainly not even convicted of any peaceful protest, right? Nothing like what- [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2812.72s)]
*  Vandalism, right? Burning a car. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2815.9199999999996s)]
*  Vandalism, right? Graffiti, whatever. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2817.12s)]
*  Right, whatever. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2818.56s)]
*  Had pardoned them. And then one of them had assaulted a child or killed someone in a car accident. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2819.3599999999997s)]
*  Can you imagine what the political environment would be like? Every person in America would know [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2826.24s)]
*  this happened. Every single person. It would be 24-hour coverage on [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2830.3999999999996s)]
*  every right-wing media channel and show. And then also then it would move to CNN and everywhere. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2834.16s)]
*  And all the corporate media and all the legacy media would all cover it and it would be a big [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2842.0s)]
*  fucking thing. There'd be hearings. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2846.16s)]
*  Every Democrat would be asked to whether they disavow Biden's pardons. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2847.2799999999997s)]
*  They would. Someone would be forced, like Gerald Goldin or someone would be pressured into putting [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2852.08s)]
*  a censor motion into place. The White House press briefing would be an absolute shit show [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2858.0s)]
*  every single day. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2863.28s)]
*  I mean, those examples that I just mentioned, those happened weeks and months ago. That wasn't [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2864.0s)]
*  this week. Those were old examples that I found that I just remembered because we were talking [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2868.4s)]
*  about the most recent pardons that have to do with financial corruption. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2873.44s)]
*  I was listening to Ezra Klein's podcast with Zeke Fox, the crypto reporter, and they're going [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2878.0800000000004s)]
*  through all of the crypto crimes. And Ezra makes a point that Trump is muzzle velocity corruption [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2882.8s)]
*  using Steve Bannon's term. That you're doing so much corruption, so many crimes so fast, [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2889.1200000000003s)]
*  that it's impossible to keep up. That is true, but it's also a failure of the media. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2892.88s)]
*  And I don't mean just entirely the New York Times or something like that. I just mean [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2898.32s)]
*  the media world, which includes Democratic Party, Democratic influencers, people with podcasts like [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2902.4s)]
*  us, to have the power to actually drive a conversation that informs people about this. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2907.36s)]
*  And we don't have that power yet. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2912.2400000000002s)]
*  One last item just to make us mad before we move on to the interview. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2913.52s)]
*  There's news that Paramount, the parent company of CBS, has offered Trump $15 million [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2918.2400000000002s)]
*  to settle the lawsuit that he has against 60 Minutes for choosing the edit on their [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2925.52s)]
*  Kamala Harris interview, choosing which parts of the interview they put on television and which [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2933.6000000000004s)]
*  parts they put online. Because you can see the whole thing, either online or on TV. If you want [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2941.52s)]
*  to find it, no one's hiding anything. Still won, still beat her, didn't matter. But anyway, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2946.8s)]
*  they offered Trump $15 million to settle this case, but he said no, because he's demanding [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2954.0s)]
*  more than $25 million plus a public apology. And his lawyers are arguing in court that Donald Trump [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2960.7200000000003s)]
*  suffered, quote, mental anguish from CBS News, editing the 60 Minutes interview. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2970.56s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2979.2799999999997s)]
*  Some of you just have to like step back and explain these things to realize just how [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2980.24s)]
*  fucking crazy they are. Paramount has a merger with Skydance before the FTC. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2983.7599999999998s)]
*  There's nothing particularly controversial about this merger. You know, we can talk all we want [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2991.52s)]
*  about media consolidation, but this one's pretty pro forma, certainly with the Republican [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2995.36s)]
*  administration. It would be greenlit under any scenario. Donald Trump sued CBS, as you pointed [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=2999.68s)]
*  out, for a completely absurd case that would be tossed out of any court. But the owners of Paramount [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3005.3599999999997s)]
*  desperately need this merger to go through. They were going to make billions of dollars when it [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3011.8399999999997s)]
*  goes through. And so the Trump administration is holding up the merger to force Paramount to pay [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3015.12s)]
*  to pay Trump personally. This money presumably would go to his library, his foundation, his [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3024.0s)]
*  pocket like the ABC settlement did of $25 million to get their merger approved. I mean, this is [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3030.4s)]
*  pure oligarch stuff. This is Russia. It is unbelievable. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3036.96s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like we've like skipped Orban at this point. We're now in Putin territory. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3042.32s)]
*  And it is, I mean, it is, I mean, I can't even imagine what it's like to work at 60 Minutes or [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3048.08s)]
*  CBS right now as a journalist who's they're doing, this is not their fault. They're doing [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3053.12s)]
*  their jobs. People at CBS, the president of CBS News has resigned. The head of the executive [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3057.2799999999997s)]
*  producer of 60 Minutes has resigned. And it is, it is what Paramount is doing is gross. What Trump [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3062.24s)]
*  is doing is gross and is once again bribery in the purest definition of the word. They are [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3069.8399999999997s)]
*  exchanging money for a government for a government approval of a merger. That's it. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3075.44s)]
*  Wild, wild stuff. And then you put on top of that all the other stories that are out there about [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3080.64s)]
*  they're all anonymous sources, but about various media executives telling like the folks at The [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3088.32s)]
*  View to tone down their anti Trump stuff. You're seeing this at multiple media organizations, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3093.68s)]
*  because these are media companies owned by large corporations with large interests before Trump. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3097.92s)]
*  And they are afraid of Trump and they don't want to anger him because they don't want to get in [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3103.2s)]
*  their way. And so this is how you get, this is like, if you read the books about what happened in [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3106.72s)]
*  Hungary to the media, this is exactly what happened. This is exactly what happened, how the [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3112.16s)]

*  And that's what's happening here. Yeah. And look, it is a choice not to fight back. And I don't think [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3123.36s)]
*  in some cases it's necessarily necessarily even a hard choice between fighting back or capitulating. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3129.44s)]
*  We are already seeing Trump lose in court. I don't know how many different fucking times on some of [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3133.84s)]
*  these, like all the loss, all the law firms that he went after, he's losing in court and all those, [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3138.08s)]
*  because they're obviously unconstitutional. A fucking judge just put multiple exclamation [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3143.12s)]
*  points in their ruling on the latest law firm, Wilmer Hale, that just beat Trump in court, [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3148.0s)]
*  because the judge just couldn't believe how unconstitutional it is. He's racking up losses [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3155.28s)]
*  with Harvard already. And there's, I mean, so you can fight him. And I realized that for corporate [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3159.84s)]
*  media, it's different because they, you know, have a bottom line and they don't, maybe they don't give [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3166.48s)]
*  a shit. They just care about their money. But like, we're able to stop this. If people get off their [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3169.44s)]
*  asses, pay attention, fight back, take, show a little courage, we could fight this, as opposed [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3175.2000000000003s)]
*  to just like letting this happen. The folks at CBS can, they can resign. They can't force Sherry [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3182.0s)]
*  Redstone and the folks at Paramount to not be terrible here. And we can't force that Sherry [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3186.8s)]
*  Redstone to do what we want, we the public. But ultimately the answer here is for people to [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3191.68s)]
*  support independent media. Like that, like that, that is where this is going at every step of the [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3196.24s)]
*  way. It's just proof that media companies owned by large corporations with interests before Donald [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3202.16s)]
*  Trump cannot be trusted to do the right thing in these situations. Right, right. And for all the [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3207.52s)]

*  really nice sweater options that in other places I feel like would be like hundreds of dollars that [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3477.52s)]
*  are very, very affordable on Quince. What I'm trying to say is they have great stuff. All the [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3481.28s)]

*  great to have you on. Thanks for having me, John. You were the pardon attorney at the Justice [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3509.36s)]
*  Department and there is quite a bit of pardon news right now. None of it good. But before we [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3513.92s)]
*  get to all that, I want to start with your story for people who may not be familiar with it, [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3519.76s)]
*  because it's a wild one that ends with the Trump administration firing you after you argued against [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3524.88s)]
*  restoring Mel Gibson's gun rights. So what happened there? Yeah, that's exactly right. So I was very [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3530.88s)]
*  much hoping to be able to stay on and do some good work in this administration. My role as pardon [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3538.88s)]
*  attorney is intended to be a non-political role. The idea is to make recommendations to the [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3543.92s)]
*  president about how he can use his clemency power in a way that is fair and free of political [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3548.88s)]
*  influence. So I hoped and expected to be able to continue on into this administration, but that [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3554.1600000000003s)]
*  was not meant to be. In March, I was very abruptly fired from my position on a Friday afternoon and [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3559.76s)]
*  walked out of the building by security officers. The events that you referred to leading up to my [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3566.56s)]
*  firing are where it gets pretty weird and I'm happy to talk about that. Please do. So I was [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3572.88s)]
*  asked to be part of a project involving restoration of gun rights to people who've lost their right to [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3579.2s)]
*  own a firearm because of a criminal conviction. There are millions of people in this country who [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3584.7999999999997s)]
*  are in that position. And the idea was that the Department of Justice wanted to start giving gun [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3589.12s)]
*  rights back to some of these people. I was asked specifically to make a recommendation to the [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3593.6s)]
*  attorney general that she restore the gun rights of a friend of the president, the actor Mel Gibson. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3599.7599999999998s)]
*  Mel Gibson was actually appointed to be some sort of ambassador to Hollywood by President Trump at [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3606.48s)]
*  the start of his administration. And he had sent a letter to the Department of Justice explaining [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3611.04s)]
*  that he lost his right to own a gun in 2011 when he was convicted of domestic violence. He was [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3615.7599999999998s)]
*  convicted of abusing, assaulting his former girlfriend and as a result of that, he's no [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3622.32s)]
*  longer allowed to own a firearm. So I was asked to recommend that he get his gun right back. And [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3628.4s)]
*  really the only reason given to me to make that recommendation was the fact that he has this [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3632.6400000000003s)]
*  personal relationship with the president and he's a famous actor. And that wasn't enough to convince [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3637.76s)]
*  me that he's someone that could safely own a firearm. There's a lot of data out there. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3643.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, there's a ton of data that suggests that people with domestic violence histories [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3649.84s)]
*  are much more dangerous when they're armed. And so I couldn't make that recommendation. And within [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3654.08s)]
*  hours of communicating to the leadership of the department that I was unable to fulfill that [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3658.88s)]
*  request, I was fired. And from what I understand, Pam Bondi ended up granting him his right, his [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3664.4s)]
*  gun rights back anyway. Yeah, after, after I left, she did it anyway. So it seems to me like the [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3671.6000000000004s)]
*  them firing you might be more of an excuse, might've been more of an excuse than direct, [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3680.8s)]
*  like they were just using the Mel Gibson thing as a, as a, as a pretext to fire you if they [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3686.6400000000003s)]
*  could have restored it themselves anyway. So they definitely didn't need me to make the [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3691.52s)]
*  recommendation and they've never told me why I was fired. No one's ever explained it to me. I got a [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3695.92s)]
*  three sentence memo telling me I was fired under the president's power of Article Two of the [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3702.08s)]
*  Constitution. But what I will say is that the department of justice is using people in career [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3706.56s)]
*  positions like mine to try to give a veneer of legitimacy to decisions that are really just [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3713.44s)]
*  political favors, trying to wrap them up in some kind of legitimacy by having a non-political [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3719.92s)]
*  appointee like myself make a recommendation when a recommendation isn't even needed. And that was [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3726.16s)]
*  shown here because as you noted, Pam Bondi gave Mel Gibson his guns back anyway. And they not only [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3731.52s)]
*  fired you, but then they tried to silence you shortly after that. Can you talk about that? [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3737.84s)]
*  Yeah. So I was asked to testify before members of Congress about my firing from the department of [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3745.84s)]
*  justice. And that testimony was scheduled to take place on a Monday on the Friday before that night, [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3751.6s)]
*  I was at a performance. I took my parents to a performance with my husband and we were leaving [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3758.08s)]
*  the Kennedy center just after nine o'clock that night. And I received a call from someone in the [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3762.88s)]
*  department of justice who was calling really just as a favor to give me a heads up that there were [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3768.7999999999997s)]
*  armed law enforcement officers on their way to my home to deliver me a letter. And the letter was a [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3774.16s)]
*  warning against testifying before members of Congress on Monday. So I very fortunately was [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3780.16s)]
*  able to talk with this person about the fact that my teenager was at home alone. It would be very [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3787.2s)]
*  upsetting for these folks to show up at my door at about 10 o'clock in the evening. And this person [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3792.3199999999997s)]
*  was able to help me call those officers off. But the intention was to have these armed officers [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3798.08s)]
*  deliver a warning to my home at 10 o'clock on a Friday night. Aside from that being just absolutely [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3802.96s)]
*  thuggish behavior, what basis did the officers have for giving you a letter that said you're [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3810.24s)]
*  not supposed to testify? Well, there's no basis. The letter was written by a political appointee [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3817.8399999999997s)]
*  who works for the deputy attorney general, or at least that's whose name was signed to it. And [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3823.12s)]
*  the leadership of the department is really now just a collection of President Trump's former personal [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3827.92s)]
*  attorneys. So this was a woman who was a junior member of his defense team who is now has oversight [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3833.3599999999997s)]
*  of matters of ethics and professional responsibility within the Department of Justice. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3840.08s)]
*  And she fired off this letter warning me that I would be violating all sorts of legal obligations [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3845.04s)]
*  if I were to testify in front of members of Congress. I read the letter carefully. There's [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3851.52s)]
*  no basis to any of it. And I went ahead and testified anyway, because I believe that that [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3857.2799999999997s)]
*  was the right thing to do to shine a light on, frankly, the corruption that is taking place [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3862.96s)]
*  right now in the Department of Justice. Yeah, it sounds like it was the right thing to do. And also, [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3868.96s)]
*  you're suing the Trump administration now, I believe. Yeah, I am. I actually have two different [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3873.2s)]
*  pieces of litigation going. One relates to an appeal of my unlawful firing. My firing from the [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3878.56s)]
*  department plainly violates civil service laws, I mean, laws that have been around for many, many [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3884.7200000000003s)]
*  decades to protect career federal workers. And I have another lawsuit that involves the Freedom [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3890.96s)]
*  of Information Act. I have asked the department to produce information about the reasons for my [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3897.28s)]
*  firing, and they have refused to do so to date. So I am now taking that matter to court and hoping [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3903.1200000000003s)]
*  that the court will require the department to comply with their legal obligations and give me [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3908.96s)]
*  that information. Can you talk a little bit about what it was like being the pardon attorney at DOJ [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3914.0800000000004s)]
*  back when that process was much different before Trump? And like, how was the process supposed to [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3922.0800000000004s)]
*  work in the pardon attorney's office? Yeah, it was much different. It was much different before [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3927.2s)]
*  the change in administration. Ordinarily, the way pardons work is there is this office within [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3932.7999999999997s)]
*  the Department of Justice that reviews and vets applications for clemency that come in from people [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3938.56s)]
*  around the country. About 80% of applicants are people who are incarcerated and serving a prison [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3944.56s)]
*  sentence. Those people are generally seeking a commutation of their sentence, which is a reduction [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3950.16s)]
*  of the imprisonment portion of their sentence. Then the rest of the applications are generally [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3955.52s)]
*  from people who are living in the community who've already completed their sentence and they [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3960.48s)]
*  are seeking pardons. Pardons are usually reserved for people who have completed their sentence [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3965.36s)]
*  sometime in the past, were convicted of a minor crime, and have demonstrated exemplary conduct [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3971.12s)]
*  and rehabilitation in the community in the years since. So all those applications typically come [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3977.04s)]
*  through the office of the pardon attorney. We would review them closely, vet the applicants [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3982.64s)]
*  carefully, and make recommendations to the president about who should receive clemency free from any [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3987.2s)]
*  type of political influence. That's the process in ordinary times. That is not what's happening now. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=3993.44s)]
*  Yeah, clearly. I mean, you were ultimately replaced by Ed Martin after his nomination for [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4000.4s)]
*  U.S. attorney for D.C. was withdrawn due to, in part, his praise and support of a Nazi, [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4007.68s)]
*  January 6th convicts. He's since been on something of a pardon spree himself with Trump, [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4014.24s)]
*  handing them out to various Trump donors and supporters. What's your take on Ed Martin's [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4021.68s)]
*  tenure at DOJ so far? It's really quite a shock to reflect on the fact that he is my successor. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4026.8799999999997s)]
*  My position is one that was non-political, and he is just about the most political person in [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4035.2799999999997s)]
*  the administration. He recently tweeted, he said, no MAGA left behind, which was a reference to a [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4041.44s)]
*  pardon that was granted to a sheriff, a corrupt sheriff who was a Trump supporter. He seems to be [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4050.56s)]
*  on a mission right now to identify other MAGA loyalists who he believes are deserving of [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4057.92s)]
*  pardons, which as far as I can tell is everyone. There's been some news recently that he has been [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4064.2400000000002s)]
*  working with an attorney who has a relationship with Trump and who is representing a whole bunch [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4069.92s)]
*  of members of the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys who are seeking pardons. He's also considering, [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4075.2000000000003s)]
*  apparently, pardons for the men who plotted to kidnap the governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4082.0s)]
*  so he's really out there in terms of what he's looking at and the criteria that he's applying [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4088.0s)]
*  to the extent there are any are completely different from the criteria that the Department [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4093.52s)]
*  of Justice has always applied in recommending pardons. He does not seem to feel bound at all [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4099.36s)]
*  by this document called the Justice Manual, which kind of lays out all the guidelines and rules that [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4105.92s)]
*  Department of Justice employees are supposed to follow. It's really quite shocking. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4110.96s)]
*  I thought my successor was bad. I got Stephen Miller, but yours is much worse. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4116.080000000001s)]
*  Well, we could have an extended debate about where we land. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4121.120000000001s)]
*  So your colleagues who are civil servants who are still in the Justice Department, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4126.88s)]
*  they must be going crazy watching Ed Martin go through some of these pardons. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4133.6s)]
*  Is there anything? I know the pardon power is so absolute for the president. Is there anything [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4139.4400000000005s)]
*  that can be done to slow these down? Is there anyone in DOJ who is trying to slow this down? [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4143.92s)]
*  Do you think? Well, the thing that's tricky about the pardon power is that it's in the Constitution [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4149.76s)]
*  and the Constitution puts no limits on it. So there really are no rules. There have always been [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4155.12s)]
*  norms and there have always been policies that have applied to pardons, but those have gone out [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4161.04s)]
*  the window under the current administration. And really the only way to address it when you have [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4166.24s)]
*  someone in the White House who is abusing the pardon power in this way is through a [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4172.0s)]
*  constitutional amendment, which is really, really difficult to accomplish. We've seen a lot of [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4177.76s)]
*  presidents use pardons in different ways. And you know, this is somebody who worked in the Obama [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4183.2s)]
*  White House. Really the high point was President Obama's use of clemency. He used it in a way that [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4188.4s)]
*  was very disciplined and principled and fair. And that was intended to really show mercy to people [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4194.32s)]
*  who had earned it and people who deserved it. And as a result, those people have gone out in the [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4201.28s)]
*  community and have done really well. The recidivism rates are low. There are people who are doing [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4206.639999999999s)]
*  extraordinary things and they earned those second chances and are using them well. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4212.5599999999995s)]
*  But we're already seeing now people from Trump's first term in office who got clemency, who are [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4217.759999999999s)]
*  back in prison, who have committed violent crimes. In just a few short years, the approach of not [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4223.92s)]
*  vetting people, of granting clemency on the basis of political loyalties and affiliations rather than [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4230.64s)]
*  merit is just one that is not consistent with public safety and it's really destructive to [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4237.84s)]
*  our system of justice. I do feel like this, the pardons have been sort of an undercovered aspect [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4243.04s)]
*  of the Trump administration. And I've sort of been wondering why it hasn't broken through more. I [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4252.240000000001s)]
*  started thinking about this with the January 6th protesters and convicted criminals all being [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4258.32s)]
*  pardoned and released by Trump early on. I mean, people like you and I and a lot of people who pay [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4264.5599999999995s)]
*  close attention to this are horrified by a lot of these pardons, most of these pardons. What would [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4269.44s)]
*  you say to someone who doesn't follow politics or even the news that closely about why Trump's [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4273.599999999999s)]
*  pardons should worry them, why they should matter to them? There are a couple of different reasons. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4281.12s)]
*  One is that there is just no process in place. It's a free for all. It's a marketplace for pardons [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4287.36s)]
*  and people are paying exorbitant amounts of money to get them. It's just a pure [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4294.16s)]
*  corruption of the powers of the presidency. We're hearing about people paying millions of dollars [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4299.679999999999s)]
*  to get access to the president with the hope of their pardon being granted. So that should be [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4306.0s)]
*  alarming to all Americans because most people, even who are Trump supporters, certainly cannot [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4310.88s)]
*  afford that type of access and they can't get those benefits in that same way. The other thing [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4315.76s)]
*  that's really destructive is that the president is just showing total disregard for verdicts that [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4322.4800000000005s)]
*  have been imposed by juries, for prosecutions that are being pursued by his own department of justice. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4328.320000000001s)]
*  It's creating essentially a two-tiered system of justice that gives the rich special and preferential [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4335.52s)]
*  treatment. There was this case recently that was really particularly disturbing, a guy named Paul [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4342.72s)]
*  Walsack who was convicted of essentially skimming money off the tops of paychecks of the doctors [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4348.08s)]
*  and nurses that he employed and he used the money to buy a two million dollar yacht, jewelry, clothing, [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4355.04s)]
*  all sorts of lavish items. The judge who sentenced him decided that he needed to spend some time in [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4361.12s)]
*  prison and said at his sentencing, I am sending a message that wealth is not a get out of jail [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4367.44s)]
*  free card in this country. And then literally days later, Trump swooped in and he granted Walsack a [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4373.759999999999s)]
*  full pardon, which not only totally goes in the opposite direction of what the judge was trying [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4381.679999999999s)]
*  to do. I mean, it sends the exact opposite message. Wealth is a get out of jail free card, [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4388.32s)]
*  but it also had the effect of wiping out the obligation that Walsack had to pay back the money [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4393.84s)]
*  that he owed. There's this thing called restitution, which is required in cases involving financial [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4401.12s)]
*  crimes. You've got to pay back the money that you owe to your victims if you're convicted of that [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4407.6s)]
*  crime. And the pardon just wipes it all out. So Walsack's victims will not be repaid. He will not [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4412.32s)]
*  have to spend a day in jail. And the real kicker is we just learned from reporting of the New York [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4417.92s)]
*  Times a few days ago that Walsack's mother spent $1 million to attend a dinner with Trump just [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4423.68s)]
*  days before he got that pardon. So it's totally corrupt. It's totally destructive to our system [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4430.4800000000005s)]
*  of justice. It's really just, it's just awful. And I worry that, I think I worry most that it [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4435.84s)]
*  sends a message to would be criminals that if you have enough money or if you're a Trump supporter, [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4442.72s)]
*  or if you're a rich Trump supporter, you should go commit a crime if you want, because there's [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4449.92s)]
*  always the chance that you can get a pardon. In fact, there's a very good chance that you can get [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4456.32s)]
*  a pardon. And I would tell people who are like, well, what does this matter to me? I think you [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4459.28s)]
*  look, do we want a policy like this that leads to more crime and more criminals? Because if someone [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4463.6s)]
*  wants to harm you or someone wants to scam you, they know that the president's got their back or [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4470.88s)]
*  Ed Martin's gonna say no MAGA behind. So I really worry about sort of the potential crime and [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4475.36s)]
*  violence that this could lead to. Well, it almost becomes a business calculation. I think there are [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4481.28s)]
*  people who are probably thinking I could make X millions of dollars if I commit this crime, [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4486.4s)]
*  and then I could spend a small percentage of that to get myself a pardon. So it's worth it. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4491.36s)]
*  And that's the way the calculation is working out for a lot of people. There's another guy named [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4496.08s)]
*  Trevor Milton. Milton launched this company that was supposedly going to build the world's first [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4501.76s)]
*  electric powered semi truck. And Milton defrauded investors to the tune of almost $700 million. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4507.84s)]
*  Milton made a donation of around $2 million to Trump's campaign. Then he got a full pardon [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4516.400000000001s)]
*  that wiped out his obligation to pay back almost $700 million in debt. So that was actually a really [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4522.8s)]
*  sound business decision. He you know, he made $700 million, he paid off $2 million, and that's a win. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4529.92s)]
*  Wow, it's just just horrifying. It was obviously difficult and risky for you to speak out and fight [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4536.88s)]
*  back and continue speaking out as you are. What do you say to your former colleagues at DOJ or other [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4544.64s)]
*  civil servants still in the administration who want to do the right thing who want to speak out, [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4551.6s)]
*  but are understandably scared? Yeah, I think that this is the time to be brave. This is the time to [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4557.76s)]
*  lead with conviction and courage. And it's hard. It's lonely. It's scary. But once you compromise [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4564.56s)]
*  your integrity, you cannot get it back. So I've tried to set that example that, you know, despite [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4572.8s)]
*  the challenges of standing up, it is ultimately the right thing to do. It's very hard in the [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4579.68s)]
*  Department of Justice to do that. The people who are still in the department are very limited in [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4585.6s)]
*  their ability to speak up. And folks who have left are very scared because there is this culture [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4590.08s)]
*  of silencing people. But I would really just encourage my fellow civil servants to [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4595.04s)]
*  stand on their principles and just have confidence that ultimately that will be what prevails. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4600.320000000001s)]
*  Well, thank you so much for speaking up. And thank you for for joining the pod. Where can people [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4606.64s)]
*  find you? I know you have a sub stack now. Yeah, I have a sub stack. It's called lawyer oiler. I'm [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4612.0s)]
*  also on Instagram and tick tock as lawyer oiler. And I'm doing a lot with pardons. I'm covering [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4616.64s)]
*  pardons, talking about the $1 billion in debt that President Trump has forgiven through pardons. So [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4622.48s)]
*  I encourage everybody to check me out either on sub stack or Instagram or tick tock. Thanks, [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4629.76s)]
*  Liz. I really appreciate you joining. Take care. Thanks so much for having me, John. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4634.88s)]
*  That's our show for today. Thanks to Liz or for coming on. Love it. We'll be back on Sunday with [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4638.32s)]
*  a special conversation about what a series of historic labor strikes can teach us about [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4642.08s)]
*  organizing and building political power today. Have a good weekend, everyone. Bye, everyone. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DDvTk0fnZ0&t=4646.4s)]
