Video Description: Donald Trump and Kamala Harris offer two very different closing messages as we enter the last week before the election: Harris hits the trail with Beyoncé and Michelle Obama and pitches her economic plan for Puerto Rico, while Trump and his cronies light up Madison Square Garden with more vitriol, racism, and hate than even we're used to. Jon, Lovett, and Tommy react to a packed weekend of campaigning and discuss how the Harris campaign is making the final sale. Then, Alyssa Mastromonaco talks with former Speaker Nancy Pelosi about what it's like being one of Trump's "enemies within," what's keeping her up at night, and what she's expecting on Election Day.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Kamala Harris Jumps On Trump After His Racist, Disaster Rally at Madison Square Garden
**Pod Save America:** [October 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs)
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Jon Favreau. I'm Jon Lovett. I'm Tommy Vitor. On today's show with one week to go [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=0.0s)]
*  one week [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=6.58s)]
*  Big big deep breath. Don't like that. In out. Our two candidates for president could not be closing more differently [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=8.88s)]
*  Kamala Harris held rallies with Michelle Obama and Beyonce that hit on themes of [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=15.08s)]
*  Reproductive freedom and bringing the country together [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=19.36s)]
*  While Donald Trump just headlined a five-hour rally at New York City's Madison Square Garden that was filled with more hate and open racism [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=21.8s)]
*  Than we've heard at a political event. I think in decades and I cannot even a Trump event [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=29.08s)]
*  I cannot remember anything quite like this [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=34.48s)]
*  We'll get into all that and then later [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  Former speaker Nancy Pelosi talks with Alyssa Mastromonico about what it's like to be one of Trump's enemies within [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  What's keeping her up at night and what she's expecting on Election Day? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  but first [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=48.28s)]
*  so I'll be honest when when people were comparing Trump's plans to hold a rally at Madison Square Garden to the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=49.599999999999994s)]
*  Pro Nazi rally that was held there in 1939. I thought it was a bit much [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=56.1s)]
*  Plenty of other presidential candidates from both parties have held rallies at the garden over the years that no one would confuse for being pro-nazi [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=61.3s)]
*  But regardless of what words you might use to describe Trump's rally [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=69.22s)]
*  You can decide for yourself whether JD Vance was right in later calling it a quote celebration of America [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=73.26s)]
*  Let's listen and these Latinos they love making babies to just know that [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=80.7s)]
*  They do they do there's no [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=85.34s)]
*  pulling out [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=89.18s)]
*  They don't do that. They come inside just like they did to our country [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=91.18s)]
*  There's a lot going on like I don't know if you guys know this but there's literally a floating [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=94.78s)]
*  Island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. Yeah, I think it's called Puerto Rico [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=98.9s)]
*  All right. Heck. Yeah, it's cool black guy with a thing on his head. What the hell is that a lampshade? Look at this guy [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=104.18s)]
*  Oh my goodness Wow [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=110.26s)]
*  I'm just kidding. That's one of my buddies. He had a Halloween party last night. We had fun. We carved watermelons together [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=115.26s)]
*  It was awesome as the first Samoan Malaysian [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=121.02s)]
*  Low IQ former [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=125.78s)]
*  California prosecutor ever to be elected president. It was just a groundswell of popular support. She is the devil whoever screamed that out [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=128.78s)]
*  She is the Antichrist. She is some sick bastard that Hillary Clinton, huh? What a sick son of a bitch [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=137.22s)]
*  The whole fucking party a bunch of degenerates low-lives jewel haters and low-lives [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=144.29999999999998s)]
*  Every one of them we need to slaughter this other people [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=151.54s)]
*  America is for Americans and Americans only when I say the enemy from within the other side goes crazy [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=156.5s)]
*  Becomes a sound the whole how can he say? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=163.94s)]
*  No, they've done very bad things to this country. They are indeed the enemy from within [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=166.9s)]
*  But this is who we're fighting a day of love another day of love [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=171.86s)]
*  General impressions guys you think that got some undecided voters off the fence. What do you think? I mean weirdly [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=178.86s)]
*  Trump's actual speech was basically just a stump stump speech to a bigger than usual crowd if it had just been him [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=185.38s)]
*  I think it would have kind of been a nothing burger, but they decided to turn it into basically another day of the RNC [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=192.06s)]
*  It's interminable RNC was much nicer. Well, just this like long endless [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=198.26s)]
*  You know group of speakers and some of them were effective and some of them were boring and some of them crossed the line in [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=203.42s)]
*  Ways that I don't think we've ever heard at a Trump rally at least not recently [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=208.62s)]
*  And by the way, just to your point that it was like an RNC. These were not people [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=211.66s)]
*  Just going up there and speaking off the cup. These were [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=216.5s)]
*  Vetted speeches in fact, I was reporting that these were that that the that the Puerto Rico comment was in a speech that was put through [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=220.78s)]
*  Teleprompter and that they took out some of the other material for being offensive [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=227.58s)]
*  there was that there was a line in his original speech that [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=231.22s)]
*  Called Kamala Harris the c-word and the campaign took that out took that line out [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=234.3s)]
*  But then they sent the rest of that speech right to the prompters [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=238.82000000000002s)]
*  although the campaign is saying he ad-libbed the Puerto Rico joke the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=241.58s)]
*  the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=246.38000000000002s)]
*  the general impression of the whole thing is a reminder that for a lot of like the core base like Trump is a [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=247.70000000000002s)]
*  Personality higher for bigots, you know, he's just like he's their avatar and when these people have a few hours to I I don't know drink [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=254.66s)]
*  Be bored [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=263.06s)]
*  This is what comes out [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=264.62s)]
*  but pretty pretty ugly and like I have to imagine [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=266.78s)]
*  Fundamentally unhelpful. Yeah, I will say too [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=272.82s)]
*  You're right. It was just Trump's rally speech. It was Trump's typical stump speech but like [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=276.98s)]
*  Doubling down on the enemy from within which is why I wanted to play that part of it [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=282.66s)]
*  And you know, he did the we're an occupied country liberation [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=287.26s)]
*  It's like I guess we're numb to it because he's said it so many times now [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=291.82s)]
*  Yeah, we're very much on to it [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=295.58s)]
*  But on its own is incredibly dark to a way to close the campaign [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=296.58s)]
*  like when you really I was listening to the because I listened to his whole speech because I was wondering if you would do anything [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=300.18s)]
*  different, you know, and [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=304.46s)]
*  He's really like even in 2016 even in 20 2020 [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=306.06s)]
*  He was like going down a rabbit hole of talking about like the FBI and Peter Strzok and things [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=309.94s)]
*  You had to like have a degree in MAGA online MAGA to know what he's talking about 2016 [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=315.58s)]
*  He's still talking about the Washington establishment. We're gonna fight them [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=320.14s)]
*  He basically when everyone's like, oh, what are Kamala Harris's plans? Donald Trump is only offering in his speeches now like [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=323.38s)]
*  deporting even legal immigrants [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=330.62s)]
*  I guess drilling [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=333.34s)]
*  tariffs and [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=335.82s)]
*  Enemies list and I'm gonna prosecute people. That's it [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=337.7s)]
*  That's all he's doing now and then it then the rest is just like an hour of grievance [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=340.02s)]
*  You can get some tax cuts for tax cuts for for for corporations [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=343.09999999999997s)]
*  Yeah [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=346.18s)]
*  I mean you can tell what the campaign wanted was at the very beginning which is are you better off than you were four years [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=346.38s)]
*  ago Kamala you're fired get out right you could tell that's what they wanted on the evening news [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=350.86s)]
*  But then he ends up doing these crazy riffs about how there's a couple hundred thousand [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=355.15999999999997s)]
*  Kids who are missing in the US are dead or they're sex slaves and they came in because of Kamala's open border. They played [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=358.9s)]
*  Like this like snuff footage news clip you're real, you know a couple different times [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=366.26s)]
*  They played all this like really disgusting, you know, some descriptions of crimes by undocumented people [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=371.78000000000003s)]
*  I mean it is it's gotten so so dark and we are very much used to it [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=378.34000000000003s)]
*  But you know that darkness in his speech is not what led the headlines [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=382.58000000000004s)]
*  It was these people who came before him. I also there's been so much focus [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=387.04s)]
*  We're gonna talk about it more on Tony Hinchcliffe that comedian that did the Puerto Rico joke [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=390.86s)]
*  But the reason I wanted to play all those other voices is the Trump campaign their response now is like oh, it's a joke [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=395.42s)]
*  It was one joke. Well, like no, no, no, no [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=402.16s)]
*  America is only for Americans. That's Stephen that was even Miller his top policy advisor potentially the next White House chief of staff [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=405.0s)]
*  The things they said about Hillary Clinton about Kamala Harris [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=413.5s)]
*  I mean it was not it was not just one joke about Puerto Rico. There's Rudy Giuliani getting up there [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=416.0s)]
*  And [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=420.94s)]
*  So, do you guys think that the Trump campaign was happy with how that went [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=423.82s)]
*  They can't be I mean you're when your main headline is about whether the warm-up act literally first speaker at the rally [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=428.54s)]
*  Has hurt your standing with all Latino voters like that is not a good headline [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=434.82s)]
*  And again, it wasn't just AOC weighing in it wasn't Democrats [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=438.06s)]
*  They can't just say this was canceled culture. The campaign had to walk back from this joke [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=442.2s)]
*  A bunch of Florida elected officials put out statements Trump's trade advisor Peter Navarro [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=447.38s)]
*  Who's like a real MAGA dead ender called Tony Hinchcliffe? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=451.90000000000003s)]
*  The biggest stupidest asshole that ever came down the comedy pike. That's a Trump advisor saying that so this is a real mess [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=455.42s)]
*  And you can't just blame the comedian like his show kill [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=461.94s)]
*  Tony is a roast comedy show a lot of the jokes there are like them saying whatever is kind of the most offensive shocking thing and [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=464.5s)]
*  Often it's very very racist and you can love it you can hate it you can listen to that but but [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=472.46s)]
*  Booking that guy to do that set at a political rally is [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=477.94s)]
*  Unbelievably stupid it is political malpractice and it's of course this was gonna happen because like you can get away with saying things at [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=482.22s)]
*  A comedy club you can't ever ever say at a political rally [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=488.72s)]
*  They are morons for letting him or there or the other guy who said Hillary Clinton's a son of a bitch or the guy that [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=492.34000000000003s)]
*  Said that we should slaughter the Democrats or I mean like there's just it's on and on and on [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=497.52s)]
*  Past just I would you need it [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=501.62s)]
*  well call these people and also just that like in the same way that like I think they were caught off guard by the [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=503.26s)]
*  revulsion to JD Vance because [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=508.74s)]
*  They don't realize how offensive some of the things he has said are in the past [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=510.98s)]
*  They don't realize how strange and extreme and bigoted they've gotten I think that's another case right they have this guy a lot [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=514.66s)]
*  Of the remarks are vetted right? This is what they want people to get up there and say and they I think of course they're now [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=519.68s)]
*  Backtracking because the backlash was so severe, but like they wanted this to be a bigoted route rabble rousing [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=524.78s)]
*  Event they are enjoying the comparison Tucker Carlson saying that Kamala Harris is Samoan or Malaysian or whatever when he fucking knows better [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=531.62s)]
*  Interestingly I mean per usual Tucker Carlson kind of played narrator at this thing where he talked about how [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=540.74s)]
*  He had been given from Trump the gift of freedom and liberation by being able to say what he really thinks now, right? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=547.14s)]
*  And then you just saw it throughout all these speakers and the biggest problem with the [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=553.02s)]
*  the the kill Tony jokes the Tony Henshaw jokes were [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=556.46s)]
*  Racist and awful they also were not even funny. They weren't jokes [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=560.5s)]
*  No, just like shitty observations, and you can get away with a lot of things if you're funny [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=564.1800000000001s)]
*  But also buddy this wasn't a comedy set it was also an endorsement speech. He ended by saying like [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=569.66s)]
*  God voted three months ago. We voted in a week [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=575.14s)]
*  I mean as he said Trump survived the assassination attempt [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=577.52s)]
*  it's not a it's not a fucking comedy show and a comedian just doing a bit and free speech and cancel culture when the [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=580.26s)]
*  Candidates top policy advisor gets up there week before the election and says [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=587.82s)]
*  America's for Americans and Americans only and then the speakers at the rally start saying making jokes about Puerto Ricans black Americans [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=591.98s)]
*  A number of other people and it just it's it's what they want, right? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=600.9s)]
*  Like it's it is their worldview right and they wanted to get that across. Yes. I also like and [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=605.5600000000001s)]
*  Tucker Carlson, we'll talk about more of this later [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=610.86s)]
*  Basically saying like if they tell you Kamala Harris one [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=614.1s)]
*  It's illegitimate is inconceivable that she couldn't because of our racist views on her [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=617.3000000000001s)]
*  Which teach which tell us that anyone who says she's compelling or successful as a politician is lying to you [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=621.46s)]
*  And I'm not gonna lie anymore. I'm gonna be honest about my racism [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=627.1800000000001s)]
*  Can I just say one thing about the like look it was a there was it was a night of disgusting [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=629.46s)]
*  racist anti-democratic anti-american speeches [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=634.9s)]
*  But this idea that like a guy makes a fucking terrible joke like this [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=637.52s)]
*  Which is not just racist but as Tommy said a bad joke and then people are criticizing it [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=641.92s)]
*  It's like oh you guys can't take a fucking joke. I fucking hate that because which is what JD Vance said [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=645.96s)]
*  But then if JD Vance is like this is the problem [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=650.9399999999999s)]
*  this is what we're running against PC culture blah blah blah and then they have a someone had a couple headlines from a [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=652.72s)]
*  couple weeks ago when JD Vance [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=658.1999999999999s)]
*  Said that the Gretchen Whitmer video of the Dorito don't even just doesn't even bother [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=660.8s)]
*  Was like horribly offensive and terrible [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=667.52s)]
*  No one in the venue was laughing. Well, this guy posted a video of Don Rickles at [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=671.2s)]
*  Ronald Reagan second inaugural saying nobody had a problem with Don Rickles speaking at Ronald Reagan second inaugural [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=678.4s)]
*  First of all, it wasn't a political event. It was a nonpartisan event [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=684.48s)]
*  Also, Don Rickles turning over in his fucking grave and the number of like hacky fucking terrible comedians who say Don Rickles was an equal [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=687.0s)]
*  Opportunity offender is like he's very frustrating. It's also like hey, man, like [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=695.24s)]
*  You can joke about whatever you want to joke about it has to be fucking funny and like [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=700.8s)]
*  Jodelnik has talked about this a bunch of other comedians talk about Seinfeld by the way [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=704.72s)]
*  Went out there and said like you can't make any jokes anymore [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=707.92s)]
*  The PC culture is coming after it and he actually thought about it and he came back later said, you know what? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=710.32s)]
*  I thought about it. That was a stupid thing to say [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=714.48s)]
*  I don't believe that why because culture change and politics change and you have to hit the goalposts like the goalpost may move [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=716.2s)]
*  What's funny may be harder may be more difficult and you have to fucking hit it and like the idea that these [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=721.88s)]
*  terrible fucking comedians make the dumbest worst jokes and then everybody's to defend them because of their free speech is a very frustrating [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=726.44s)]
*  Okay, if the joke was funny wouldn't be in this whatever effect this may or may not have on actual voters [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=733.0s)]
*  I do think there are they're now seven days left at the time. There were what eight days left? So they lose Monday now [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=737.76s)]
*  Because Monday was all about Madison Square Garden and the fact that they had it like a hateful racist rally [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=746.88s)]
*  Tuesday now is gonna be Kamala Harris is closing argument speech. So they lose she gets the spotlight for Tuesday [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=752.68s)]
*  So they're just losing days [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=757.68s)]
*  Yeah, and we keep talking because we're on the Kamala Harris side about like she needs to close the deal [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=759.44s)]
*  She needs to do this [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=765.44s)]
*  The race is pretty much tied like Trump needs to close the deal to with voters and he just lost [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=766.12s)]
*  He's just lost a day doing that at the very least if not if not worse if [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=772.4000000000001s)]
*  If not like getting people off the fence to say like that's fucking crazy, you know [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=777.12s)]
*  I think we just don't know the full effect of [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=781.08s)]
*  This kind of rally in the closing days and what it looks like for people to be hearing about it and like because I do [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=783.72s)]
*  Think that there's a bunch of people that are in this home stretch gonna be reaching out to like friends and loved ones should be like [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=788.4000000000001s)]
*  Hey, I know you've seen a lot of things [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=794.2s)]
*  I know you were saying like this [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=796.12s)]
*  Here's why I think this important and like this is there's a very good time for Trump to do some be part of something [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=797.16s)]
*  So awful and it doesn't seem like a coincidence that yesterday bad bunny Ricky Martin and J Lo all endorsed Kamala Harris [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=802.48s)]
*  Well, it was a coincidence that that earlier in the day before this even happened [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=807.64s)]
*  She released her economic plan for Puerto Rico in Philadelphia. That was just like what timing [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=813.1999999999999s)]
*  There are four hundred seventy thousand Puerto Rican Americans in Pennsylvania biggest population of Puerto Rican Americans of any swing state [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=818.8s)]
*  Certainly larger than Biden's 80,000 vote margin a victory in 2020 [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=824.96s)]
*  This is probably one reason as Tommy mentioned that a lot of Republican politicians sort of like fell all over themselves to condemn this Rick Scott [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=829.64s)]
*  Florida's got a I think a million Puerto Rican Americans [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=836.84s)]
*  and [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=840.32s)]
*  We wanted to find out whether this might actually have an electoral effect next week [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=842.08s)]
*  So we checked in with our pal Carlos Odeo Democratic strategist who's an expert on the Latino vote. Here's what he said [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=845.88s)]
*  That's a great question because I think we're used to Trump and his allies saying wildly offensive things [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=852.5s)]
*  But those things don't always make it to the kind of low information voters who are going to decide where this ends up at [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=859.66s)]
*  The end of the day, so I want to do manage expectations that this is not providing new information [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=866.66s)]
*  But if there is an exception, I would say it is the Puerto Rican piece [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=870.9399999999999s)]
*  specifically because of the way that those comments those [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=876.8199999999999s)]
*  Incredibly unfunny comments were so incendiary. They were almost designed to be amplified at scale [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=881.74s)]
*  I'm surprised. What's app didn't go down in in Puerto Rico and in Central, Florida and in Allentown in Redding, Pennsylvania [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=889.9399999999999s)]
*  And they were instantly amplified by major players who had been on the sidelines of this election [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=897.98s)]
*  So you had bad bunny and Ricky Martin [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=904.74s)]
*  weighing in for Harris [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=907.66s)]
*  Normally, you would say in the era of Trump these things go down a rabbit hole [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=909.66s)]
*  And yet this particular moment and in the way it was timed [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=914.9s)]
*  Felt like it could be an exception. So the Harris campaign also has a new ad out today [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=920.14s)]
*  I can't tell if it's a video ad or how much money is behind it or whatever, but they made an ad about this [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=925.1s)]
*  Nate Silver also did a little research and [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=931.26s)]
*  He says there's some initial evidence that the rally is drawing broader attention [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=934.26s)]
*  Today and yesterday are the top days of Google search traffic for Trump since the second assassination attempt against him in September [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=939.5799999999999s)]
*  If the chart was interesting, it's like this pretty straight lines. The first assassination time is like off the charts convictions pretty small [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=946.42s)]
*  That's a bump though. Second assassination is like the conviction little bump and then now this is getting up towards that level [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=953.18s)]
*  Which I think is pretty telling yeah, I talked to AOC which you'll hear on Wednesday and it was before the rally [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=959.6s)]
*  But we talked about Puerto Rico [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=965.28s)]
*  It's also the period of time when people who don't ever think about politics are thinking about it for maybe the first time in four years [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=966.52s)]
*  They're deciding whether to vote and this can't be helpful [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=972.36s)]
*  No, and again like and that's with we've been talking about the Puerto Rican American community [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=975.4s)]
*  But if you know Google Trends and Google searches on of Trump are like going like if anyone who gets any part of that rally [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=979.46s)]
*  Yeah, there's not there's there's almost no good parts for that rally [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=985.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I mean voters all across the country. No, I know not thinking about politics are like that stuff [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=988.84s)]
*  Yeah, and if you see the hell and look look the the headlines, you know [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=993.8000000000001s)]
*  We're a lot of critique about headlines over the last several years. They all New York Times Politico Washington Post [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=997.5400000000001s)]
*  They all had you know racist [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1003.8000000000001s)]
*  Incendiary rally in the remarks like I think this is one that that broke through again [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1006.36s)]
*  Because it's the fucking final week of the campaign not the most important point but a group of people that I'm sure [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1010.02s)]
*  Yell when they have to press one for English [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1015.9200000000001s)]
*  Hillary Clinton would not be a son of a bitch. She would just be a bitch. So that bothered you I know it's like [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1018.4s)]
*  You're gonna you're gonna claim you're bothered by people speaking Spanish. You don't speak fucking English. That is very true [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1023.26s)]
*  Trump also [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1030.76s)]
*  Point well taken Trump also sat down with Joe Rogan on Friday [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1032.8799999999999s)]
*  I know that's a few days ago now, but in fairness [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1036.02s)]
*  That's a that's how long it takes to listen to Joe Rogan's podcast almost literally the interview clocked in at about three hours [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1038.92s)]
*  And as of Monday afternoon though has nearly 35 million views on YouTube alone Wow [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1046.56s)]
*  Did you guys have how far did you two make it? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1054.3999999999999s)]
*  I am an hour and a half in and I'm just like I can't do it anymore [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1056.84s)]
*  Maybe through the whole thing at two point Sam to mostly to speed I gotta say to [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1060.04s)]
*  It was about politics [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1067.04s)]
*  3.5 [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1069.6399999999999s)]
*  He talks slow enough that you get more than you think I try to avoid watching Trump live [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1070.6s)]
*  So that I can watch him faster [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1074.48s)]
*  So there's less time spent on Trump and so I listened to him at at two [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1076.24s)]
*  I was like wow [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1080.48s)]
*  He's pretty energetic and then when I like I think I moved from my car to back to my phone [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1080.78s)]
*  And then he was back at 1x. I was like Jesus Christ. Yeah, this is terrible [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1084.3999999999999s)]
*  What'd you guys think [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1090.36s)]
*  If you saw somebody on social media telling you that it's the worst interview Trump ever did that it was embarrassing that Joe Rogan was [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1091.96s)]
*  Horrified and thought Trump was embarrassing. You should just keep in mind that those are people you should not listen to because fake news [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1098.3s)]
*  It was fake fucking news. Do I think it's like a groundbreaking interview? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1104.06s)]
*  Of course not he rambles and he gives all basically all of his same answers [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1107.82s)]
*  But as a forum for Trump, it was also like I think [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1112.58s)]
*  The the best kind of interview he could hope to get Joe Rogan was incredibly solicitous kind of keying him up with ways [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1117.02s)]
*  To take on some of the arguments from the left there it was a it was a love fest for Trump [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1124.42s)]
*  Do I think that necessarily matters? I have no fucking idea, but it was not it was a good interview for him [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1130.46s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not like a fan of Rogan's and a regular listener [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1136.18s)]
*  I'm not a hater because I've like dipped in at times and heard celebrity interviews and things that were interesting and you know [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1139.32s)]
*  Obviously, he's very successful [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1144.66s)]
*  So I going into it I had like a little bit of hope that because he'd been critical of Trump and because he was an RFK [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1146.18s)]
*  Maybe he would push him on some things during the three hours [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1151.8799999999999s)]
*  Maybe he'd do a little research to prep himself, but like I was couldn't have been more disappointed [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1155.3s)]
*  It was entirely friendly Rogan took everything at face value from [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1160.04s)]
*  From you know Trump saying he said some secret thing to Putin to prevent him from invading Ukraine [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1164.76s)]
*  To Trump bragging about being able to run on a treadmill all day even at the highest elevation like everything was taken at face value [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1171.48s)]
*  Rogan he kicked off the questioning about the 2020 election denial by basically saying, you know, everyone does this Hillary question 2016 [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1178.92s)]
*  yada yada yada [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1186.8000000000002s)]
*  But never really like he came back to it, but he didn't get past it [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1188.24s)]
*  There was one point where he said are you ever gonna show us the evidence? Yes, that was a good moment [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1191.52s)]
*  I suppose but yeah, like it was a it was um, I feel like it was an example to me of like [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1195.72s)]
*  What [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1201.74s)]
*  The I see a lot bunch of people are like canceling their Washington Post subscriptions because they're mad that Jeff Bezos is Washington Post [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1202.9s)]
*  It's not endorsing and it just I think is that it is that a helpful thing to punish the journalists of the Washington Post [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1209.38s)]
*  I do not think so [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1214.88s)]
*  but where does that impulse come from and I think part of where it comes from is this kind of like endless feeling of like [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1215.5800000000002s)]
*  Dispiriting exhaustion that like there's a fundamentally fraudulent case Donald Trump is offering just a fundamentally flawed and fraudulent case [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1221.28s)]
*  And this was just a forum for him to lay out that case [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1228.36s)]
*  But if it's not questioned if it's not challenged if it's entirely solicitous [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1230.96s)]
*  You see why if you're not paying that close of attention or if you're receptive to receptive to in the first place [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1234.22s)]
*  Why Donald Trump is so appealing because in that forum? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1239.06s)]
*  It's all it's a ton of lies and bullshit and [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1242.36s)]
*  Self-aggrandizing made-up stories, but it's compelling and he's charming in it. I thought it was not compelling. He was not good [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1246.28s)]
*  It's meandering use me and not even because of the like all the frames about Trump [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1252.8s)]
*  It's not the the bigotry and lies from the rally. It wasn't that it's not the [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1257.52s)]
*  He's addled and losing it kind of shit. He's just he's a he's a bad [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1262.6s)]
*  Conversationalist because all he cares about you don't get the weed dude [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1267.76s)]
*  Right all he all he cares about is himself and his fucking stories [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1271.28s)]
*  And he's one of those people like you could tell I was watching some of it too [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1275.32s)]
*  You could tell Rogan to like Rogan was extremely solicitous and very nice to him [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1278.86s)]
*  But you could tell at times Rogan's look at him like okay [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1282.24s)]
*  What what next like he just the stories and first of all all the stories [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1284.64s)]
*  I mean if we've been listening to Trump for way too long all the stories we heard before thousand times again we now [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1288.3600000000001s)]
*  We analyze Kamala Harris's speeches now and her interviews and be like, oh, did she talk about people though? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1294.5600000000002s)]
*  She talked about what you're gonna do for people Donald Trump was like at one point at the beginning [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1300.24s)]
*  He was bitching about how hard it is to build things in New York because of all the environmental [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1305.3000000000002s)]
*  Regulations and the permits and the unions and he's yelling and he's and it's like he's like talking about something from 10 15 years ago [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1309.76s)]
*  Then he's talking about burying windmills and blades and it just it is all it like it is itself aggrandizing [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1315.6399999999999s)]
*  I just I cannot imagine that unless you were a Trump fan if you could sit through that whole thing [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1322.28s)]
*  You'd be like, yeah this guy I think this guy could be in charge this guy this guy was looking out for me [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1327.2s)]
*  That's not where I landed either. I just like [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1332.84s)]
*  The I think that like the way he was talking about he like he talks about I again it's all just bullshitting [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1336.56s)]
*  What did you think was appealing? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1342.0s)]
*  I first of all he they had very they had like kind of a they had charming interactions about about [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1343.24s)]
*  UFC and about fighters [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1348.4399999999998s)]
*  I think like knows his stuff when it comes to the UFC and boxing and they connected on that and the audience really likes [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1349.8799999999999s)]
*  And and then the stuff about building like it's he it's all pretend right? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1354.3999999999999s)]
*  But he's kind of trying to display for that audience a kind of like I know about building like I knew New York [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1360.1999999999998s)]
*  But I didn't know DC so when I was trying to recruit people I knew how to recruit people in New York [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1365.6s)]
*  But I didn't know how to recruit people in DC [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1369.48s)]
*  There was a conversation about staffing up and how you have to use politicians because if you use business people that haven't been vetted before [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1370.84s)]
*  He just to me it was like the of course [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1377.08s)]
*  Yes, he's rambling and the stories go on forever and occasionally Rogan didn't know exactly what he was talking about [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1380.36s)]
*  But inside of that was like this is like this is a business guy who knows his stuff on business [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1385.7199999999998s)]
*  he kind of gets into co vid financing and [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1391.82s)]
*  He gets into why the debt existed it just like [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1395.6s)]
*  It was to me like the the best I have seen Trump in a very long time [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1399.56s)]
*  I don't know if it gets him anything. I do think they connected on some level. I definitely think he Randall rambled [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1403.76s)]
*  That audience might be gone. I think Rogan is looking for conspiracies in every corner, and I think Trump served them up [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1410.3999999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah frequently the thing that just he was just so frustratingly uninformed again [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1417.4199999999998s)]
*  I know Joe Rogan isn't you know meet the press but like he referred to Kamala Harris being in her late 40s [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1421.52s)]
*  He was talking about the bipartisan immigration bill that Trump killed and he literally said to Trump what was in that bill [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1426.8s)]
*  It's like buddy. You could have you could have googled that he like there's this is my hobby horse [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1432.48s)]
*  There's no like pushback or context about the Afghanistan withdrawal and the fact that Trump negotiated the withdrawal time frame [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1436.2s)]
*  Rogan's a big RFK guy. He's talking about healthy foods. There's no [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1443.64s)]
*  Thinking or acknowledgement that Republicans are the ones who like want to get rid of the EPA to allow all these chemicals into our atmosphere [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1447.56s)]
*  And make our foods less healthy so just it made me insane [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1453.44s)]
*  But like stepping back from it what I was thinking when I was watching the interview is [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1456.28s)]
*  To that interview that his two advisors gave to semaphore about what their strategy is and I do think if you watched all three [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1461.04s)]
*  Hours that interview you come away a little bit [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1467.64s)]
*  Inoculated against the idea that Donald Trump is some like fascist menace [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1470.92s)]
*  I just think you do because they they the the section about 20 about the vote in 2020 [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1475.52s)]
*  Was so favorable to Trump. There was nothing about the insurrection [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1482.44s)]
*  He just I think comes across [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1488.0s)]
*  In this non-threatening way in that forum and I do think it's like worth keeping that in mind when we talk when we get talking [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1490.76s)]
*  About the argument around fascism and all the rest that like this is a version of Trump [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1496.76s)]
*  That you know a lot of people are seeing and it's it's I think it's I just don't want to dismiss it [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1500.96s)]
*  Yeah, I wouldn't dismiss it at all. I'm just saying and I think that on some of these podcasts that he's done [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1507.4s)]
*  It is a good forum forum. Yeah, and he sounded better. I think on this one [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1512.44s)]
*  He has he's just he was very like to me [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1516.0s)]
*  It's it's you're right if people are worried about the fascism thing that it's gonna help that but like at this stage a week out [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1518.8s)]
*  If you're undecided first of all if you're undecided a week out [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1526.32s)]
*  I don't know that you're listening to three hours of Joe Rogan because you're probably a low-information voter low propensity voter [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1529.18s)]
*  so that that's you know uncertain and [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1534.9s)]
*  At this point you want to be again. We're gonna say this about Kamala Harris [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1537.5800000000002s)]
*  We've been saying it for a month you want to know like what what is this person gonna do for me, right? [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1540.78s)]
*  And I don't think that he did that at all, you know [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1545.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think just I think that Rogan was a bit of a Trump skeptic and this interview all but stamped his approval [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1547.46s)]
*  By the end and I don't know how many people that moves or if it matters but on the margins it could especially given the [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1554.9399999999998s)]
*  35 million number you cited on YouTube. Yeah, I have the same disappointment you did [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1560.74s)]
*  I was like, oh, I just I like also bought into some of what I'd seen online before I went into it and I was [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1564.8999999999999s)]
*  Like, oh maybe Rogan's gonna push back here and there but it just wasn't there [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1569.96s)]
*  So Harris campaign said that they were interested in going on but it didn't work out. What do you guys think about that? I [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1572.58s)]
*  I [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1579.3s)]
*  It's a huge show I think writing off any audience generally is a mistake in politics [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1580.54s)]
*  I'd love to see Obama go on or like Colin Allred or somebody who might you know, kind of jive with him [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1586.18s)]
*  You know in terms of love of sports, but I think in a normal length campaign [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1592.18s)]
*  It would be a mistake to skip it doing it now a few weeks left [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1598.02s)]
*  Gotta go to Texas gotta spend three hours. Like I don't know that Harris should should have done it [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1602.6200000000001s)]
*  I think it's would probably been a bad use of time. Yeah, I think would have been a bad interview [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1607.1s)]
*  Yeah, I think like he for all the reasons that you guys cited and haven't listened to half of it [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1610.54s)]
*  He's he clearly loves Trump. He didn't you know endorse Trump up to this but he's he's he's got his facts wrong on a whole bunch [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1616.5s)]
*  Of things. He's not pushing back. He's got Trump's worldview. He's got RFK juniors worldview probably more than Trump [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1623.5s)]
*  Kamala Harris does not and so she would have to spend how many hours going back and forth with him over like basic facts [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1628.82s)]
*  That he would you know, like I just it he claims he wasn't gonna push her on that [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1635.3s)]
*  He claims he just wanted to have like a who are you? What's your deal conversation? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1639.34s)]
*  But yeah, I mean he has a he's clearly got the kind of a grieves [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1642.8999999999999s)]
*  You know cancel culture whiner worldview and I think with Brett Baer on Fox [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1646.46s)]
*  You know that it is a set amount of time for the interview fight that you're gonna push back that you're gonna do this [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1650.86s)]
*  You can't do that for two hours and three hours. No, I also like I take to her what [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1655.26s)]
*  Binder told Dan which is that you know [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1660.02s)]
*  There's all this sort of discourse around this the unique set of issues that appeal to young men that we're trying to reach [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1662.82s)]
*  But actually they care about the same set of issues every as everybody else [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1668.54s)]
*  To a large extent and so to me it'd be less about like should she do this one interview [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1672.26s)]
*  I do think this larger constellation of kind of less political podcast and and YouTube shows that are aimed at men like I [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1675.76s)]
*  Would like to see us engaging with them more and like the Theo Vons of the world and all the rest but beyond that [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1681.74s)]
*  It's like well, she is going to a lot of places where you reach young men. She's on Charlemagne [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1686.48s)]
*  She's doing all kinds of things. So like they do have a strategy around this does Rogan necessarily fit into that [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1690.48s)]
*  Maybe maybe not but it's just one show [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1694.72s)]
*  Yeah, I am look I've always been on this in this train, but like do not go on a show because you're platforming whatever [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1696.44s)]
*  I'm just I've been long done with oh, yeah [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1702.46s)]
*  I don't know it's a big show with a big audience you go on if you're in politics, right? [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1705.3600000000001s)]
*  Like that's you're you're you're trying to reach people you go do it [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1709.1200000000001s)]
*  Unless unless you think it's not gonna serve you politically because the substance of the interview itself is not gonna make up for the [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1711.9199999999998s)]
*  Reach that you get rigged against you [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1718.24s)]
*  Yeah [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1719.6399999999999s)]
*  so I caught this quick clip of Rogan talking with some of his buddies after he'd recorded it and they're in the guys were like [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1719.8799999999999s)]
*  What'd you talk about? [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1725.56s)]
*  And one of them said did you ask him why he was so pro vaccine and Rogan's like kind of I mean the only time [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1726.28s)]
*  I was sort of frustrated in the interview was Trump started talking about the polio vaccine [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1732.94s)]
*  Eradicating the disease and I wanted to show him the chart of how that actually isn't true [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1736.86s)]
*  And it's like but he said I decided not to get into it because I didn't want to go down a long path [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1740.76s)]
*  About vaccines and it's like okay wait so the one time you were disappointed in this interview [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1744.9799999999998s)]
*  Joe Rogan was when Donald Trump said the polio vaccine [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1749.06s)]
*  Eradicated polio now imagine [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1752.6599999999999s)]
*  Interviewing Kamala Harris and and and him bringing up that point [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1755.4199999999998s)]
*  What do you even do? I don't know [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1759.34s)]
*  Like so now we're gonna have Kamala Harris prep [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1762.1799999999998s)]
*  I mean I have changed my mind on this because at first I was like well [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1764.12s)]
*  I think it might be good for her to go on but having listened to him to Trump and [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1767.36s)]
*  Even that it's like you're gonna have to prep Kamala Harris now for a day [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1771.28s)]
*  Were you instead of prepping her with just all the things you'd prep her for for normal interviews you'd be like oh by the way [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1774.7199999999998s)]
*  On vaccines you've got to know your shit on polio and this study and that I mean come on six months ago [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1779.3799999999999s)]
*  Yes, now right exactly. Yeah [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1784.9599999999998s)]
*  All right, so everything we see shows the race is still a toss-up [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1787.0s)]
*  But the Trump campaign and [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1791.04s)]
*  Maggerworld are as confident and cocky as I think I've ever heard them even more so than in 16 or 20 [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1793.52s)]
*  After campaigning in places like New York, California [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1799.3600000000001s)]
*  Colorado Trump is also making stops in New Mexico and Virginia this week two states Republicans haven't won in decades two decades [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1802.3200000000002s)]
*  And here's a puzzling comment Trump made to speaker Mike Johnson during the MSG rally on Sunday [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1809.92s)]
*  And I think with our little secret we're gonna do really well with the house, right? [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1815.3200000000002s)]
*  Our little secret is having a big impact. He and I have a secret [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1819.76s)]
*  We'll tell you what it is when the race is over [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1823.68s)]
*  So Johnson got asked on Monday what the secret might be and he said by definition a secret is not to be shared [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1825.88s)]
*  And I don't intend to share this one. Do you think fucking what the fuck kind of like I'm sorry dictionary.com [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1831.8s)]
*  Unbelievable, do you think that Trump made Johnson his accountability partner? [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1838.68s)]
*  Uses to monitor his kids porn intake [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1843.72s)]
*  Trump is fucking like if he should be just an aging drag queen cuz that's that's like the energy of these comments [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1846.56s)]
*  Just a kind of like it's a it's a Sunset Boulevard like me and Mike Johnson. We have a little secret. Don't we Mikey? [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1853.6000000000001s)]
*  We have a secret [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1861.32s)]
*  Don't tell anybody what we talked about anyway immigrants [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1863.48s)]
*  Maybe they have a secret plan to actually hang Mike Pence. Yeah, I finished the job [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1868.3600000000001s)]
*  So just to have a conversation about this [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1873.56s)]
*  Some people are wondering if this has to do with [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1877.76s)]
*  some plan between [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1882.8799999999999s)]
*  Johnson and Trump so that if like, you know [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1885.1599999999999s)]
*  If Harris wins and Johnson still speaker the house that he will not certify the election or he'll engage in some [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1887.8s)]
*  Shenanigans and then he'll try to throw the election to the house in which case if the house votes then Trump wins [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1894.8s)]
*  I [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1900.04s)]
*  Don't know. I don't what do you guys think? I did not quite get that it's possible [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1901.56s)]
*  but just the verb tenses that Trump used it makes me it made me it I took it as [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1906.0s)]
*  They've got a secret about how to win the house not that but I don't know [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1912.0s)]
*  I didn't know either and I don't ever want to find out [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1916.76s)]
*  Yeah [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1919.6399999999999s)]
*  So everybody do everything you can to win the fucking house if we win the house on January 3rd [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1919.8799999999999s)]
*  Mike Johnson and Donald Trump could have whatever fucking bedroom secrets they want to have and it won't matter [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1923.5s)]
*  Will really matter if Mike Johnson is still the speaker [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1927.84s)]
*  so I really like the fact that like there was this this this was a line that came at the end of hours of [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1930.44s)]
*  Menace of Tucker Carlson basically denying any kind of camel Camilla win could be legitimate and it felt menacing when you hear it [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1936.96s)]
*  I read like the feeling I had when I heard him say it was like, oh, that's a menacing fucking comment [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1944.46s)]
*  Maybe it's innocuous their secret fucking game plan to win the house. I don't know. I don't want to find out [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1948.68s)]
*  I want people to be clear about that too because yeah, I saw some people saying oh well [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1953.04s)]
*  Even if if Harris wins, even if Democrats win the house Johnson will still be speaker during January [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1957.92s)]
*  He won't be he won't be he won't be the new Congress will be seated on January for January 6th will be wild [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1964.18s)]
*  This is the hopefully less wild. Hopefully that's wild [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1970.84s)]
*  But it'll be so if Hakeem Jeffries is speaker and then also even if you know [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1973.28s)]
*  Whoever they have is if the Republicans win the Senate and whoever the leader is there. There's still not they we got it [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1977.76s)]
*  That happens we got it at least in the Congress part [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1984.92s)]
*  There's no shenanigans in Congress at that point because we would control the house [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1987.6399999999999s)]
*  But to the point you made about Tucker right because Tucker's doing this [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1991.72s)]
*  How could she possibly win 86 million votes or whatever? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1995.2s)]
*  And this is if you look on social media right now every fucking blue checks maga count [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=1998.52s)]
*  They are we talk about like don't read too much into the early vote [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2003.2s)]
*  They think the early vote is like just crud. They are crushing Democrats right now [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2006.8s)]
*  They're like Trump is gonna win all seven states and like they they have me [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2012.38s)]
*  I don't know whether they actually believe this or whether they're just like, you know spewing bullshit to talk [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2017.5800000000002s)]
*  But like if Trump loses [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2022.7800000000002s)]
*  It is they are talk about stop the steal [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2025.8200000000002s)]
*  Like they are very primed to say that there's absolutely no way possible that Kamala Harris could have won this [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2028.3600000000001s)]
*  Whether they're being cynical or naive. I think one of the big lessons of a decade of trouble is it doesn't matter [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2034.8200000000002s)]
*  There in either way, this is what they're going to pretend to have believed if Donald Trump loses [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2039.96s)]
*  So I do think that that matters. I do but I also like I think it's like yes [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2046.44s)]
*  It's about getting ready for post-election shenanigans [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2050.52s)]
*  But I do think part of it is like look any campaign puts up yard signs like yard signs are about a bandwagon effect [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2053.12s)]
*  We all do that everybody does that but there's something specific about Trump because so much of the argument is about [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2058.8s)]
*  Character and about him being sort of morally unacceptable and so creating a kind of permission structure [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2063.88s)]
*  That's like they're all crazy. Look the country's behind him. Like you come on board, right? [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2069.36s)]
*  Everybody's doing it and I think that matters more for him than it would for a normal candidate. Yeah [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2073.76s)]
*  Meanwhile Kamala Harris is keeping up her breakneck schedule in the battlegrounds [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2079.0s)]
*  She's in Michigan as we're recording this three rallies today in Michigan three events [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2082.2000000000003s)]
*  And earlier today she responded on the tarmac to a reporter's question [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2086.8s)]
*  About Trump's Madison Square Garden hatefest [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2090.96s)]
*  Here's that response along with comments from AOC who is of course Puerto Rican American herself [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2093.76s)]
*  And she responded during the rally while live-streaming a game of Madden NFL 25 with Tim Walls on Twitch [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2097.8s)]
*  2024 that's where that's what we're doing right? [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2105.4s)]
*  It is just more of the same and maybe more vivid than usual [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2115.4s)]
*  Donald Trump spends full time trying to have Americans point their finger at each other [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2120.4s)]
*  And the fuel of hate and division and that's why people are exhausted with him [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2124.88s)]
*  I need people to understand that when they when you have [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2131.1600000000003s)]
*  some a hole [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2135.28s)]
*  Calling Puerto Rico [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2137.96s)]
*  floating garbage [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2139.92s)]
*  Know that that's what they think about you [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2142.48s)]
*  That is exactly like that's just what they think about you [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2145.04s)]
*  It's what they think about anyone who makes less money than them [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2147.76s)]
*  It's what they think about the people who serve them food in a restaurant [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2150.56s)]
*  It's what they think about the people who who fold their clothes in a store like [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2153.76s)]
*  You're right. Are you serious? [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2160.84s)]
*  Like are you serious? Yeah, the privilege of being on this campaign is traveling across the entire country [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2163.2400000000002s)]
*  There are hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans across in battleground states that need to send them a message [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2168.8s)]
*  Would you guys think about the way? [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2176.6s)]
*  Harris responded AOC walls [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2178.7599999999998s)]
*  First of all, I want comma to get away from the jet engines. I'm never gonna let this go [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2181.4s)]
*  I also was wondering why why is Tim was whispering like he doesn't want his mom to hear him play madden [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2185.0s)]
*  It was like it's like I'm like you're everyone's very chill right now. Where's our defense? What's happening? [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2190.0s)]
*  I don't know [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2194.6s)]
*  I thought AOC was particularly good on this because she understands and is from the community and she's a really credible messenger and it [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2195.08s)]
*  Dubtales with the broader argument she's been making about Elon Musk that he's laughing at you [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2201.3199999999997s)]
*  They're mocking you and they dangle the million dollar check they're mocking you they don't care about you. They don't understand you [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2205.9s)]
*  I think that was effective the the the Harris comments about [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2210.1800000000003s)]
*  divisiveness and division and feeling the flames they're accurate [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2215.2200000000003s)]
*  But it is giving me a little bit of 2016 PTSD if I'm being totally honest. Oh, I thought it was great [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2217.7400000000002s)]
*  I thought she's she's she's you she doesn't want to get offended by them [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2223.06s)]
*  No, I think 2016 would be like this is racist. This is offensive blah blah blah blah. That's that was what 2016 was [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2227.06s)]
*  She's saying like it's the same old divisive shit. Yeah, she's saying this and we're gonna vote and we're gonna get into the whole [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2233.22s)]
*  Future forward thing in the and focusing economic stuff, but that's the pivot she's making she's not taking the bait [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2239.14s)]
*  She's not saying like I'm gonna go on on the rally and say how offensive it is [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2244.22s)]
*  Well, she commented on multiple times [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2247.8199999999997s)]
*  So I mean, they're certainly I don't know if taking the bait or not [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2249.62s)]
*  But they are certainly talking about it that they cut an ad about it that we mentioned earlier [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2252.14s)]
*  They're doing a lot of things to highlight this part of the story [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2255.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2257.94s)]
*  But I think the way that the message is from her is that he should be focused [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2258.54s)]
*  He's not focusing on you and I'm gonna be focusing on you. Yeah, that is the right message. I think that's right [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2261.9s)]
*  So as we get close to the end the a-list surrogates are out on the trail for Harris on Friday [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2266.9s)]
*  Of course Harris and Beyonce rally together in Houston and then on Saturday Michelle Obama appeared with the VP at a rally in Kalamazoo, Michigan [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2271.7400000000002s)]
*  Let's listen. We are at the precipice of an incredible shift the brink of history [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2278.7000000000003s)]
*  I'm not here as a celebrity. I'm not here as a politician. I'm here as a mother [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2288.9s)]
*  Deeply about the world my children and all of our children living [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2300.06s)]
*  A world where we have the freedom to control our bodies [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2305.58s)]
*  Do not put our lives in the hands of politicians [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2309.62s)]
*  Mostly men who have no clue or do not care about what we as women are going through [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2316.1s)]
*  Please please do not hand our fates over to the likes of Trump who knows nothing about us [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2322.38s)]
*  Who has shown deep contempt for us? [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2329.8199999999997s)]
*  Because a vote for him is a vote against us [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2334.54s)]
*  Against our health against our work so fellas [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2339.7799999999997s)]
*  Before you cast your votes ask yourselves [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2346.14s)]
*  What side of history do you want to be on? [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2350.46s)]
*  I would encourage everyone to watch the entire Michelle Obama speech [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2355.1s)]
*  It they call her the closer for a reason [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2360.06s)]
*  What do you guys think of the speech? I? [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2363.02s)]
*  Mean I thought I was one of the best political speeches [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2365.98s)]
*  A long time I was really moved by it moved thinking about it [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2368.7799999999997s)]
*  She was emotional delivering it and I actually was thinking like you put that Joe Rogan interview up against Michelle Obama [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2371.4199999999996s)]
*  And I just think Michelle Obama wins every time because yes, that might have been the most effective version of Trump [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2377.8599999999997s)]
*  You'll see right the affable businessman talking that you know shooting the shit with Joe Rogan, but this was about the stakes and [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2383.1s)]
*  I found it like it persuasive. It was persuasive [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2390.4599999999996s)]
*  It was aimed at people who aren't paying a lot of attention [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2393.8999999999996s)]
*  But it was also aimed at people who are paying a lot of attention and the best argument they can make to the people [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2396.02s)]
*  in their lives and spoke to I think a lot of the [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2399.94s)]
*  Cynicism and frustration people have who are paying close attention to I just thought it was an amazing speech [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2403.1s)]
*  Yeah, I mean speeches two parts the first half was basically her basically her like unloading the oppo clip on Trump and [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2409.14s)]
*  Going at him very hard and laying into him, and I obviously enjoyed that [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2416.2599999999998s)]
*  But that's something that a lot of people can do the second half was [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2419.46s)]
*  Riveting I mean you can hear it is silent in there people are [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2423.2999999999997s)]
*  Wrapped and paying attention and it really was unlike any speech [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2426.2999999999997s)]
*  I've heard this entire election cycle the way she talked about the stakes for everyone [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2429.2599999999998s)]
*  in terms of reproductive health and she [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2435.8599999999997s)]
*  She like she made she figured out a way to bring you emotionally into the room into the hospital room [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2438.74s)]
*  watching someone you love die and it was unbelievably powerful and [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2446.54s)]
*  I watched I mean a bunch of people told me it was great when I finally watched it [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2451.7000000000003s)]
*  I too was like blown away by just how powerful how much she connected and how much you could tell she meant it and [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2455.46s)]
*  My only thought afterwards was like how do we get this in front of everybody? [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2461.54s)]
*  How do you make sure this is the thing on tik-tok that's getting the most push? [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2466.3s)]
*  And it because it's long right there's extended chunks, and that's the power the sort of a three minute [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2470.34s)]
*  Detailed explanation of what life could be like for you and your partner if these laws pass [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2476.62s)]
*  I know I was we were trying to clip this for today, and it's hard because the whole section on [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2481.98s)]
*  Reproductive freedom is eight minutes. I think yeah, and so it's just it's hard to it's what I mean [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2488.3399999999997s)]
*  Both of the Obamas are like this right which is there's not they don't do sound bites and like [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2493.5s)]
*  One line here and there and you really have to watch the whole thing in full to get it [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2497.94s)]
*  I thought I mean we've been talking forever about like [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2501.64s)]
*  Men and appeals to men and how this works and she makes this direct appeal to men that I think is maybe one of the most [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2504.38s)]
*  Effective appeals to men on almost any issues certainly reproductive rights [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2510.22s)]
*  others like you know I tweeted this and then fucking Ben Shapiro quick tweets me, and he's like Michelle Obama [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2515.14s)]
*  Is always just disappointed in you everything she says she's just so disappointed in you, and it's like it's a funny reaction because [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2521.06s)]
*  She went out of her way in that section to empathize with [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2528.98s)]
*  What young men or what men might be thinking at one point? [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2533.3399999999997s)]
*  She says like I don't expect men to understand all that women go through with our reproductive health [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2536.22s)]
*  She's like frankly women don't always understand what's going on in our own bodies, right? [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2541.2s)]
*  But she's like just imagine if you do this and then she's like she's she's pleading with men right and she's trying to like put [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2545.46s)]
*  Herself in there shoot. I mean it's just it was so empathetic well. It's so empathetic look [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2551.02s)]
*  What [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2556.2000000000003s)]
*  Worth saying as well. Yes, there's some political value to saying oh Michelle Obama is talking down to men [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2557.76s)]
*  She is of course of course she's not it's just lazy of course [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2564.84s)]
*  It's like which Ben has become voting for Trump is a very disappointing thing for do for men to do [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2568.02s)]
*  And I think part of what that speech was about was about how to reach people that you might feel upset with that [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2572.7200000000003s)]
*  They're considering this right she says that one point in the speech like your rage may be justified [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2577.3s)]
*  But if but if you use your rage to vote for Trump you're voting against us and like that [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2581.44s)]
*  I think that idea saying that like I understand why you're upset [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2586.2000000000003s)]
*  I understand why this may be on the table for you, but it's morally wrong and and it's not just politics [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2589.6800000000003s)]
*  It's not just oh we can disagree a vote for Trump is a vote against the women you claim to love and if you love them [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2595.92s)]
*  You should listen to them Ben Shapiro was so mad about the Barbie movie that he lit Barbie dolls on fire and then released a 43 [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2602.2400000000002s)]
*  minute review of it, so just for context I just have a real [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2608.7799999999997s)]
*  Special animus towards people like Ben Shapiro and JD Vance who fancy themselves [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2613.3399999999997s)]
*  The intellectual Zamboni's right who try to make this like intellectual argument about it when it's like you know what you're full of shit [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2619.14s)]
*  You're foolish because if you actually listen to it your criticism of speech has nothing to do with what was actually in the speech [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2624.8999999999996s)]
*  Your wife was dying you would do anything it took of course you save her life you lying little shit [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2630.14s)]
*  Yeah, of course [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2634.72s)]
*  It's like if you want to pick apart facts then go try to pick apart fact, but you didn't do that because you can't yeah [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2635.54s)]
*  So like the Trump campaign the Harris campaign is also projecting confidence though [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2640.98s)]
*  Democratic strategists and reporters are doing their thing by continuing to publicly air an internal debate about which message Harris should close on [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2646.18s)]
*  The New York Times reports that future forward the big pro Harris super PAC warned in their weekly email to Democratic operatives that attacking Trump as a [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2653.62s)]
*  fascist [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2661.06s)]
*  Which two four-star generals who worked for him have now called him isn't particularly persuasive and that hammering a contrast with Trump on the economy [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2662.34s)]
*  And reproductive rights featuring Harris his own stances works better [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2669.7400000000002s)]
*  We've talked about this a lot Dan [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2673.34s)]
*  Asked Kamala's lead pollster our friend David Binder about it on Sunday's bonus pod which if you haven't listened to yet [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2675.98s)]
*  You should absolutely listen to [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2681.86s)]
*  Binder said you have to do both and here's what Harris campaign manager Genomali Dillon said about it to Jen Psaki on Sunday [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2683.9s)]
*  I mean look I think we have seen from the beginning that when people who have worked close [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2690.54s)]
*  Closest with Donald Trump speak out it has real impact on voters and certainly on these voters that we're still [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2697.14s)]
*  Trying to reach this small segment of undecided voters. We know [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2703.82s)]
*  Anecdotally we know from our research when someone like John Kelly stands up and speaks about what it was like to serve under Donald [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2708.7s)]
*  Trump speaks about how he clearly wants unchecked power [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2716.14s)]
*  The American people are not comfortable with that and that is an important contrast that we have and I think that it's fundamental to [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2719.8999999999996s)]
*  Everything that the vice president is talking about how we turn the page from this how we have a leadership in this country [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2727.5s)]
*  That's focused on the issues that the American people care about so we do think it's important [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2733.2s)]
*  It's really important when people that are closest to Donald Trump speak out about it. We've seen that across all of our data [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2736.9399999999996s)]
*  What do you guys think about this debate and particularly the balance that the Harris campaign is striking right now? So [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2742.66s)]
*  First of all, like I think the [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2748.38s)]
*  The we obviously have to do both is the answer [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2751.1s)]
*  We've always been landing on and just like you have to do both [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2754.7000000000003s)]
*  You have to make the positive case you have to make the contrast case [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2756.7400000000002s)]
*  You have to make sure people understand the threat one thing that binder said that I thought captures [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2758.46s)]
*  I think like another facet of this around this question of whether to call Trump a fascist. It's that one word doesn't [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2761.62s)]
*  One word doesn't communicate what the threat is. Yeah, and to me like that was [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2768.7000000000003s)]
*  The the most important point of this not should we describe the menace and threat that Trump poses versus should we just make a positive [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2773.14s)]
*  Argument, it's that when we talk about the threat Trump poses [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2778.8599999999997s)]
*  How do we do that and like so I asked ACA OC about this this question of like? [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2781.46s)]
*  Calling Trump a fascist and she went right to Donald Trump will take away basic rights of women across this country [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2786.7s)]
*  And so I think translating like fascism is a is a is a identity [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2791.8199999999997s)]
*  it's a it's a it's a it's a summary and [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2796.62s)]
*  Actually have to get into the details with people because people have heard for years all kinds of words that are true [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2799.54s)]
*  To describe Donald Trump the last group of people we're trying to reach our Biden eight by definition [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2805.42s)]
*  Undecided and unmoved by those broad broad brush characterizes. Are you to get into the details? [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2810.94s)]
*  I'm a little worried about the balance of the moment and not because of like the message testing of ads [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2816.58s)]
*  It's just because you have to ask yourself [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2820.82s)]
*  What is breaking through in the closing days? [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2822.9s)]
*  And I do think it is primarily this conversation about Trump and fascism [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2824.62s)]
*  And I think it's valuable to say the top people that work for him don't trust him to be president again [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2828.42s)]
*  I think that's alarming new information probably for a lot of people [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2833.62s)]
*  But it's gotten mixed in with conversations about like praising Hitler's generals and things that I think just sound partisan and hyperbolic and a lot of people [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2836.98s)]
*  Do you think the rush it off campaign has done that I? [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2845.54s)]
*  Think because we're talking about like this is what I think it's unfair that [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2848.2599999999998s)]
*  This it's like there's a lot of straw man running around here, which is like the Harris campaign's leaning in on fascism [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2852.46s)]
*  No, they're not Anderson Cooper asked her. Do you think he's a fascist? She said yes, right? [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2858.1800000000003s)]
*  Everything else they've done their ads everything else has been about what you said love it [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2862.9s)]
*  Which is conveying what the threat means to people and so like I don't know what else they would do at this point [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2867.1s)]
*  I'm not blaming anyone [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2872.62s)]
*  I'm talking about the closing conversation that people are hearing and I think it's overly tilted away from an economic message right now in [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2873.86s)]
*  Ways that worry me because every focus group and piece of polling we see [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2880.62s)]
*  Shows you that voters primarily care about those issues and they're also there's a pretty easy ready-made answer for Trump [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2884.2599999999998s)]
*  Which is we saw him for four years people don't think it was that bad [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2890.7799999999997s)]
*  And so some of the some of the language used to describe him can seem ridiculous to people [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2894.2s)]
*  So that's where my anxiety comes from and I agree with you like [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2900.02s)]
*  I'm not criticizing their strategy necessarily [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2903.74s)]
*  But you get to decide whether you do a press avail or not you have to take questions or not [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2906.46s)]
*  You have to decide how you answer things and what you highlight or not [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2910.9s)]
*  And so it does feel like they are leaning into [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2914.7400000000002s)]
*  This there's a big speech Tuesday at the ellipse where January 6, you know started, right? [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2918.9s)]
*  that is going to lead to a conversation about the 2020 election and the insurrection and [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2925.26s)]
*  Trump's fascistic tendencies and I just I'm a little worried about that emphasis [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2931.42s)]
*  When a lot of these undecided swing voters are like, I don't know but gas was cheaper [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2936.7400000000002s)]
*  But this is this is what drives me [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2941.04s)]
*  Sort of crazy because I think that there is a gap between the people who spend their days looking at focus groups [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2943.3s)]
*  I'm looking at data. I am one of them [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2948.44s)]
*  if if Kamala Harris sat down with a bunch of voters in a focus group who are undecided and [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2951.3s)]
*  She had a choice of what to say what she should say to them [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2956.1s)]
*  Of course is a lot of this economic messaging, right? [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2959.62s)]
*  Now not all of them as binder said their research shows I know that future forward has their own research [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2963.42s)]
*  But the Harris campaign research pretty good, too [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2968.86s)]
*  Their research shows that there is some segment of people who when you tell them that John Kelly said that this man was unfit to serve [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2971.9s)]
*  And he's a four-star general that gives them pause and that they may not vote for it, right? [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2978.6s)]
*  But I would still say yes Kamala Harris should deliver a message on economics [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2982.58s)]
*  Absolutely [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2986.42s)]
*  The problem is the filter and what gets through to voters and when you're saying the conversation [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2987.02s)]
*  That yeah, it gives me anxiety too [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2992.66s)]
*  But there's also like there's only so much you can control in a campaign Tuesday when she does her closing argument speech [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2994.7s)]
*  She's gonna get a lot of press attention because of where the speech is, right? [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=2999.7799999999997s)]
*  I think if she decided that for her closing argument speech [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3002.3799999999997s)]
*  She was gonna go to like a grocery store or whatever you could think something better and just do a big economic speech [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3005.3399999999997s)]
*  It would be a fart in the wind. No one would cover it voters wouldn't hear it [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3009.94s)]
*  And then we'd all be happy that you gave the right message, but no one would actually hear [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3014.1s)]
*  I mean, that's a look straw man like [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3016.66s)]
*  Fascism speech verse the most boring version of an economic event. Yes, of course like you would choose something that was interesting [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3020.12s)]
*  I think at the end of a campaign [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3026.58s)]
*  You are far more likely to get coverage and for those things to break through than in any other point [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3028.12s)]
*  And I'm just worried that the focus right now is about a message that might not be as compelling to these swing voters [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3033.2799999999997s)]
*  I think your job as a campaign is to figure out a way for the thing you want to talk about [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3039.44s)]
*  To break through and get covered. Well, I'm not I'm not criticizing them [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3044.16s)]
*  I'm just saying like when I look at kind of concerns [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3048.46s)]
*  I'm hearing from all these people about slippage and what people are saying they're hearing on the doors about well [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3052.02s)]
*  I just want to know about her economic plans and you know the need for more information about her [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3056.66s)]
*  I wonder if a closing focus that is again about Trump is answering the mail with those people [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3061.26s)]
*  I also think that she's not gonna spend like the setting is the setting I think the setting gets attention the setting gets press attention [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3066.86s)]
*  I think that the entire speech will probably be the economic stuff the contrast the whole positive vision right what breaks through, right? [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3073.38s)]
*  We're talking about kill Tony and his event comments at Madison Square Garden and not what Donald Trump said [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3080.54s)]
*  That's not under the control of the Harris campaign [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3085.3s)]
*  Then you know I'm saying like this the setting where they I'm saying the setting is where they chose and that's gonna frame up [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3087.86s)]
*  The speech where you got is but you said kill Tony [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3092.9s)]
*  They're not they don't [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3095.82s)]
*  Of [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3098.7000000000003s)]
*  I'm just making the point that like [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3099.7000000000003s)]
*  Something else can be the focus of the covered versus the words in 2016 [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3101.94s)]
*  I feel like there were a bunch of big mistakes that that we had to make [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3106.6600000000003s)]
*  Because we were running against Trump for the first time one of those mistakes that I think is absolutely a mistake [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3111.7400000000002s)]
*  But one that's been I think laid completely at the feet of the Clinton campaign [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3116.1400000000003s)]
*  What was actually a larger media failing is I think what Tommy is talking about which is she was? [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3119.3s)]
*  Traveling the country talking about the economy [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3124.06s)]
*  We always have it she did a bus tour it towards the end through the Midwest all about the economy [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3126.06s)]
*  No one fucking heard it and so [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3131.04s)]
*  You know she does do this economic message, but what's breaking through during that time? [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3133.5s)]
*  It's the anti-trump message and the anti-trump message was like I think [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3137.14s)]
*  Clearly not effective both because he hadn't been president that people weren't it was just it was we we failed to make that case [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3140.9s)]
*  The stories about his character. Yes, like I'm being a shitty guy [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3147.9s)]
*  I think now we have landed on far more effective ways to to beat Donald Trump to make the argument against Donald Trump like [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3150.7799999999997s)]
*  Kamala Harris is very good at making that argument [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3157.1s)]
*  We still have this problem of how do you break through on the economy when the catnip is the more kind of political exciting? [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3158.9799999999996s)]
*  Trump is an extremist threat now the good news right is [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3165.7799999999997s)]
*  Replacing Joe Biden with Kamala Harris and then like an incredibly well-run campaign over months has like moved the needle on the economy [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3169.74s)]
*  Has broken through like they would what their strategy has worked so far like she's like almost even with him on the economy and some [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3176.94s)]
*  Polls and even in New York Times, Sienna. She like gained. I don't know seven or eight points [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3183.2200000000003s)]
*  And so then I do think like in this last week. How do you do both of those things? [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3186.54s)]
*  I kind of like I think doing a speech on the national ellipse to just [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3189.62s)]
*  reaffirm that that that view that the Americans have that Donald Trump is chaotic and dangerous and unstable and like you can't trust him like [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3194.86s)]
*  I think is is worth doing [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3201.7000000000003s)]
*  I think that to me is the right thing to do because of the attention it gets I think the question then is okay [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3203.14s)]
*  We've hit that point how and then seven days that follow [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3208.22s)]
*  Do you drive what Tommy's talking about because it's really fucking hard to do and you've used your closing speech on [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3211.7s)]
*  The ellipse you've spent it that's been spent so it's hard [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3218.14s)]
*  But like I I come down on thinking it's the right place to reach a ton of people with a closing [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3220.9s)]
*  I think it's an all-in-opportunity costs. None of it is easy, right? [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3225.82s)]
*  But we're talking about the biggest most important decisions in the closing week and what we want to get in front of voters and [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3228.72s)]
*  It just does concern me a little bit like the Michelle the Michelle Obama speech [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3236.24s)]
*  specifically about reproductive care and access to that care and [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3242.16s)]
*  Going in great detail about the horrors that could come from Trump getting four more years [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3246.48s)]
*  Was unbelievably powerful if that speech was her framed as you know Trump as dictator [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3252.12s)]
*  And that was sort of like the prism through which that information got it [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3258.4s)]
*  It just changes the tenor and the way it lands and I think the likelihood that people get the information you want them to hear [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3261.76s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think in her in her speech. She did a lot of Trump as the threat that Trump poses [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3267.56s)]
*  She did talk about unarmed protesters, right? Like look, I think [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3271.92s)]
*  Stipulated if you're out there which no one has done [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3275.6800000000003s)]
*  But if you're out there talking about Trump is a fascist Trump is a dictator blah blah blah [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3277.98s)]
*  Like that is bad. That is very very bad [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3282.06s)]
*  But there are things that Trump could do or that want that he wants to do that [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3284.54s)]
*  We know from polling is very effective with the voters that we're talking about right people don't want him to shoot unarmed protesters [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3289.34s)]
*  That's not popular. They don't want them to pardon the January 6 protesters. They fucking hate the 2020 steal [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3295.42s)]
*  That this is why the Trump campaign has had an entire strategy to put him on these podcasts [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3300.38s)]
*  Because they know that if people think that Trump is a threat that they lose this is the New York Times today [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3305.66s)]
*  Just said that the Trump campaign is actually also worried that some of this Hitler stuff the John Kelly stuff is gonna cost them [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3311.66s)]
*  The election right so like I do I just think that it is I guess all I'm not trying to like defend the campaign or anything [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3317.18s)]
*  I'm just trying to put myself in the campaign and events happen and it's like what do you do? [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3323.18s)]
*  To respond to an event that happens like Madison Square Garden [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3328.46s)]
*  Happens and if she gets off the tarmac and a reporter says what do you think about Madison Square Garden? [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3331.5s)]
*  I just I think it it it makes me laugh to think of her saying well. I'm just focused on costs [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3335.78s)]
*  Well, yes, the dumbest possible answer is not what she's gonna say [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3341.38s)]
*  But there's like JD Vance pretended he didn't hear the joke so we didn't comment on the joke [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3344.54s)]
*  There's a million in one ways to avoid making news on the thing. You don't want to avoid on [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3348.06s)]
*  I'm not saying that's the right thing to do here [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3351.86s)]
*  I'm just saying it is a strategic choice and like do you think there would be a better a better answer off the plane? [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3353.7400000000002s)]
*  Like what do you think that I don't remember what she said now just the divisiveness thing that you possibly I don't know [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3358.5s)]
*  I have not thought about it until you just asked me but like you said running around saying fascism is not the way to go [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3363.7000000000003s)]

*  Just when Anderson Cooper know the first time was surely inside right it's been a couple of times [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3374.34s)]

*  This is what you're responding to events and and I think when you I think there's certain things where like he [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3381.78s)]
*  Proposes a very serious threat and you if she could make the choice to say no, he's not a fascist [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3386.8599999999997s)]

*  I'm saying like [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3396.62s)]
*  All we're getting at here is like [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3398.06s)]
*  These are purposeful decisions that end up having an impact on what is covered and what the closing message is and what people hear [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3400.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just yeah, I know I know for sure. I'm just saying you're cheating on this one [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3407.3399999999997s)]
*  No, because I am because I'm I'm I'm heated on it. I'm not I mean, I'm not mad [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3411.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm just saying like I have I have struggled with this so much because I've seen all the fucking data [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3414.7799999999997s)]
*  Like I don't all of our friends and the Democratic Super PACs and everyone else who's saying like this is bad [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3419.22s)]
*  We got to do more in the economy. I get them. I've been there [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3423.9799999999996s)]
*  I've seen the fucking data [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3426.22s)]
*  but like when this happens on a campaign a [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3427.02s)]
*  Campaign is also about like the exigent events that you are responding to and if you respond in a way that seems like [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3429.9399999999996s)]
*  JD Vance seemed like bullshit when he said he hadn't heard the joke if she had said she [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3436.4599999999996s)]
*  Been fucking bullshit, right and it's a clearly something that worries the Trump campaign, which is why they walked it back [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3440.46s)]
*  So, of course she should go in on that and I'm not saying she shouldn't have said that I'm just saying like [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3444.98s)]
*  It's not hard to not make news on things. You don't want to yeah [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3449.54s)]
*  It just really is and all I'm saying is I think the critique from the Super PACs that the somehow the Harris Walls campaign [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3452.84s)]
*  Is not is this the strategies leaving leaning too heavy on the Trump threat is just wrong [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3457.38s)]
*  I think it's just wrong criticism and then I think they need to close the deal in the economy for sure [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3461.2200000000003s)]
*  But I'm I guess I just I'm with binder [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3465.7400000000002s)]
*  Which is like you really just have to figure out a way to do both. Yeah, and also just like the [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3467.78s)]
*  Kamala Harris is running an incredibly impressive campaign in a media environment that sucks and makes Trump possible and like that is the that is [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3471.98s)]
*  The thing and like in the closing day hard so much harder than any other campaign to break through and so and so in that context [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3479.94s)]
*  Like how do you break through in the economy? What's the balance like where I kind of land is I have the same worry Tommy [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3485.7000000000003s)]

*  But when he says me and he talks about me or Adam Schiff for that [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3935.22s)]
*  he's really talking about the American people and I think that [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3938.88s)]
*  Vice President Harris has been very good about making that clear when he's talking about the enemy within [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3943.98s)]
*  He's talking about the American people. I [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3951.46s)]
*  Myself think we're gonna win this election because of the goodness of the American people [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3954.8199999999997s)]
*  Not because of the enemy within I think the American people when it comes right down to it [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3960.98s)]
*  Will understand that you cannot elect a person of such [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3967.14s)]
*  vulgarity such [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3971.94s)]
*  misrepresentation such [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3974.3399999999997s)]
*  Insulting the intelligence of the American people was not a day of love. It was a tragedy for our nation [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3977.68s)]
*  People ended up dying from it many injured from it and that just goes to shit [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3984.62s)]
*  But I think that there's a judgment out there that may not be [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3989.58s)]
*  Very loud. Mm-hmm, but it's very strong [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3993.7799999999997s)]
*  So you were just in Florida for a women's get-out-the-vote breakfast where you discussed the state's amendment for [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=3997.02s)]
*  Which would codify abortion rights? [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4003.7799999999997s)]
*  How important has reproductive rights been as an issue for Democrats this cycle both at the top of the ticket and down ballot? [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4005.58s)]
*  Vitally important [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4013.2599999999998s)]
*  Reproductive rates very important. I just called recall to mind that two years ago in [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4015.2599999999998s)]
*  22 the off year people said we were gonna lose 30 or 40 seats and I said they just don't know what they're talking about [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4021.18s)]
*  they make [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4028.8599999999997s)]
*  Collect high salaries, but they ain't on the ground and they don't know what's happening [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4030.9799999999996s)]
*  As we knew that that issue was very important and they said she meaning me [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4035.62s)]
*  The I owed an apology [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4041.7400000000002s)]
*  To the Democrats for putting that in the forefront [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4044.78s)]
*  Didn't I know it was in the rearview mirror and people didn't care that much [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4048.3s)]
*  But we know how those members voted and we know how our candidates [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4052.7400000000002s)]
*  were [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4058.22s)]
*  opposing that they opposed [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4059.94s)]
*  Putting Roe v. Wade and put into law and they even opposed women having a right to contraception. Mm-hmm [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4062.82s)]
*  But I have a right to contraception and they [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4070.06s)]
*  Opposed anything to do with climate crisis gun violence prevention all of that, but the women's issue the [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4073.82s)]
*  Reproductive health issue is primary. As you know, we lost five seats in New York [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4081.7400000000002s)]
*  I know and that's for a lot of different reasons, but hopefully we win them back this time [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4086.6200000000003s)]
*  But I have no doubt that we will win the House of Representatives [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4092.46s)]
*  How came Jeffries will be the speaker he must be the speaker [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4096.0199999999995s)]
*  He must be the speaker for all the issues we care about but also on January 6 to protect our democracy [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4101.139999999999s)]
*  So it's October [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4108.38s)]
*  October surprises throughout the years are of great lore and in 2008 I was on the Obama campaign [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4110.7s)]
*  many consider the financial crisis and the record rise in unemployment as [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4118.54s)]
*  The October surprise of that election [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4123.0599999999995s)]
*  But in 2008 weeks before the presidential election Congress came together to keep the economy from going over a cliff [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4125.5s)]
*  Do you think Congress could come together today to solve a problem that catastrophic? [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4132.339999999999s)]
*  You would have to you remember that that President Bush was president at the time when this happened and [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4139.46s)]
*  it was a generosity and the [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4147.339999999999s)]
*  Really responsible attitude of the Democrats that saved the day let's be quick [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4150.58s)]
*  Sure to point that out because the Republicans never lived up to their commitment right to have a hundred votes [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4156.58s)]
*  To pass this I do believe it was the reason we lost the house in 2010 [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4163.46s)]
*  because we had to save the day and [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4169.34s)]
*  People thought we were bailing out Wall Street were bailing out the economy [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4172.42s)]
*  Yep, and we always agreed that whatever we did would be bipartisan, but they didn't do their share [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4176.28s)]
*  So we had to write weigh in more heavily, but nonetheless as you indicate it was bipartisan [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4182.92s)]
*  We got the job done. I [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4189.639999999999s)]
*  Don't know that anything like that could happen under [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4192.96s)]
*  Trump because he doesn't have it the only thing he did when he was president of the United States with a Republican [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4196.84s)]
*  Majority was a tax bill that gave 83% of the benefits to the top 1% [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4204.4400000000005s)]
*  added 2 trillion dollars to the national debt to give tax breaks to the richest and [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4210.8s)]
*  biggest corporate corporate America and individuals as well and [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4217.52s)]
*  He says that's what his agenda is to renew that tax cut [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4222.24s)]
*  But at this point it will be more like five trillion dollars to the national debt. So [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4226.16s)]
*  It's hard to imagine anything we tried to do [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4231.68s)]
*  Infrastructure with him. He wouldn't do it. No, but let me just say this why am I even talking about him being president? [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4235.76s)]
*  Kamal Harris will be president of the United States. Yes, ma'am and [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4242.24s)]
*  Because of the rules of the Senate with the 60 votes and the rest we would have to have bipartisanship [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4248.12s)]
*  Right to get something big done [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4253.68s)]
*  let us always think that [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4256.4800000000005s)]
*  That that sense of responsibility [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4259.48s)]
*  Will enable the Republicans to come on board right if we make our compromise they have to make theirs, but that's our [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4261.839999999999s)]
*  Responsibility we have responsibility to strive for bipartisanship [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4269.959999999999s)]
*  To be accountable to the public about that and have transparency so the public knows right in [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4273.919999999999s)]
*  2007 you were elected first woman speaker in the house [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4281.5599999999995s)]
*  You have been the most powerful woman in politics since and you made the decision to step down from leadership [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4284.879999999999s)]
*  It takes women so long to break the glass ceiling. Why did you make the choice? [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4291.12s)]
*  What did you hope for and were you right? Well, yes, I was right [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4296.5199999999995s)]
*  Of course, but let me just [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4300.679999999999s)]
*  Say that it's not a glass ceiling in the Congress. Okay, it's a marble ceiling. Oh, yeah, it's a much tougher thing [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4303.44s)]
*  Obstacle to break [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4311.04s)]
*  No, I thought it was right. I was excited about it. I don't know if people ask me it was it right? [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4312.64s)]
*  Yes, I was I was full of excitement about it [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4317.68s)]
*  The only thing I regret it was that it wasn't going to be in the majority [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4320.48s)]
*  Sure [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4323.68s)]
*  I thought we could win it even though they said 30 40 seats was five seats, but I stayed in order to [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4324.2s)]
*  Make sure that what's-his-name doesn't set foot in the White House again and to make sure [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4331.72s)]
*  That how Kim Jeffries has that gavel [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4338.04s)]
*  But I've been there 20 years. I mean 20 years [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4341.0s)]
*  Either 8 as speaker 12 as leader, right and it's a major [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4344.12s)]
*  responsibility and you know [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4349.599999999999s)]
*  legislatively [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4352.04s)]
*  politically [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4353.24s)]
*  Fundraising wise. Yes. That was I was proud of what we had done [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4354.799999999999s)]
*  But I was glad others were willing to carry the load [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4358.24s)]
*  So you were just telling me you've been in Boston today already campaigning you're here in New York City campaigning [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4361.759999999999s)]
*  You are then heading out and crossing the country. Yeah campaigning for Democrats [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4368.36s)]
*  So one of my favorite memories was hearing Barbara McCloskey who served as US Senator for 30 years before retiring [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4372.84s)]
*  I saw her speak once about her first run in Congress in 1976 and she talked about how she raised money [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4378.92s)]
*  Through bake sales for barb [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4385.4s)]
*  So how has campaigning changed over the years with the advent of social media, do you think it's become more inclusive? Oh [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4387.44s)]
*  absolute well [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4395.24s)]
*  Separate in part from the advent of social media [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4397.24s)]
*  there was a decision made when I went to Congress and [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4401.2s)]
*  37 was a few 37 years ago a few years after Barbara went to the Senate right and we're all so proud of her the [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4405.599999999999s)]
*  there were [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4413.16s)]
*  435 members of Congress as is there [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4414.639999999999s)]
*  That is the number there were 23 women [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4417.44s)]
*  12 Democrats 11 Republicans that was absolutely [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4420.719999999999s)]
*  Unacceptable, so we made a decision to recruit to train to fund to accept self recruitment [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4425.5199999999995s)]
*  And and and that and then this Congress I'm very proud that [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4432.4s)]
*  We have 94 women right and we're going to we're going to get more in this next election [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4436.5199999999995s)]
*  So because it was a decision and social media is a double-edged sword some of its positive some of it is not [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4442.28s)]
*  But all of it is about women and of course we want minority even with the more diversity our caucus [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4451.2s)]
*  I have to make our caucus. I'm proud to say is [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4458.28s)]
*  70% women people of color LGBTQ. It's a fabulous [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4461.8s)]
*  It's a fabulous [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4468.04s)]
*  Statement about a political party in a Congress a parliament or whatever [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4470.28s)]
*  But and we still want more but the but it was a decision [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4475.32s)]
*  it wasn't just happened because of social media right and social media can be a danger to because [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4480.72s)]
*  When I'm trying to encourage women to run or talk to those who have decided they're going to run they're always concerned [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4487.88s)]
*  About the negative aspects of it they could as I could never subject my family to what you've been through [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4495.08s)]
*  I'm not even talking about the physical violence of course of Donald Trump's friends. I'm talking about the [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4501.92s)]
*  Just you become a target. That's just the way it is and they know that women here's the way I see it [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4508.56s)]
*  They know that women have a reputation for being more ethical. It's just the way it is. That's way [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4514.4800000000005s)]
*  So what do they do to our women candidates they attack their right ethical [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4520.76s)]
*  Standing by saying things make them up [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4527.160000000001s)]
*  They're not even true and with your child hears that right that their classmate heard that on TV and comes home crying [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4529.64s)]
*  Is this worth it right? So we have to get rid of that [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4537.400000000001s)]
*  politics of personal destruction which really [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4542.52s)]
*  Became a [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4545.76s)]
*  Factor during the 90s when newt gingrich became speaker [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4547.400000000001s)]

*  Specifically for folks who think she's not progressive enough [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4609.12s)]
*  Well, yeah, that was a beautiful word that the president said about Harry was wonderful and he was masterful and I [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4615.84s)]

*  Donald Trump. Mm-hmm a tragedy for our country if you were ever to be elected [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4631.56s)]
*  Everything that we care about or have done would be obliterated by him [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4638.12s)]
*  Somebody said to me the other day. What's the difference between the Democrats and Republicans and how you treat poor children? [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4644.240000000001s)]
*  I said we do and they don't right that's just the way it is [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4650.08s)]
*  so, you know with all due respect to that and I'm a progressive from San Francisco and [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4654.36s)]
*  What the thing is is that we have to win in the whole country [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4660.16s)]
*  And when I was invited by the governor of Michigan to be there for events [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4663.8s)]
*  I said then what works in Michigan works in San Francisco working class message [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4668.68s)]
*  What works in San Francisco may not work in Michigan, right? Let's win, baby [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4675.32s)]
*  Okay, so [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4680.12s)]

*  Acceptance that's what this is about. That's what I did [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4692.4s)]
*  I mean I came at it very from the left end of San Francisco [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4695.52s)]
*  But I know you have to govern from the center. So I just say to them everything that we did [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4699.4400000000005s)]
*  Joe Biden was a fabulous president [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4705.8s)]
*  Consequential our agenda was beautiful from the all the bills that you rescue package with the child tax credit [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4709.12s)]

*  CHIPS Act for our economy and for involving women in ownership as well as jobs [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4723.84s)]
*  370 billion dollars to save the planet. That's very progressive. Mm-hmm, and it would be all [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4729.96s)]
*  Negated yeah lowering the cost of prescription drugs lowering the cost of insulin. That's not what they're there for [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4737.64s)]
*  They're taking us to court on some of those things and Trump has sat down with oh, I said his name [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4743.68s)]
*  I know you don't like to do that. I don't like to do it slip down sat down with the [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4750.200000000001s)]
*  Fossil fuel industry and say give me a billion dollars and I'll get rid of all this other stuff [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4755.12s)]
*  So I just have two words for them Donald Trump bless your hearts for your [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4759.96s)]
*  Sincerity and the rest as I say that as a San Francisco [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4764.76s)]
*  liberals very close to my constituents and I had a lot of those signs in my basement for [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4768.68s)]
*  40 years [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4775.04s)]
*  Right now we want to win the White House [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4776.84s)]
*  and if they think that giving a vote to a third party or something like that is [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4779.7s)]
*  Courageous no, it's dangerous. It is dangerous. So I did want to ask you mentioned [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4786.6s)]
*  Your husband Paul and shortly after he was brutally attacked Trump took to Twitter and made a joke about it now and [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4792.04s)]
*  Minutes after Trump was grazed by a bullet in Butler, Pennsylvania [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4798.599999999999s)]
*  You released a Twitter a statement on Twitter that read in part as one whose family has been the victim of political violence [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4802.16s)]
*  I know firsthand that political violence of any kind has no place in our society. Thank God that former President Trump is safe [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4809.4s)]
*  Having walked in his shoes, how depraved does it seem that he couldn't wish you and your husband well, I [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4817.76s)]
*  Think it's indicative of who he is. That's why I come back to the goodness of the American people [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4825.08s)]
*  This is a person who has no [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4830.6s)]
*  Respect for other people. He's all about himself and his rich friends at the expense of other people [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4833.6s)]
*  he exploits [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4840.28s)]
*  Fears and concerns that people have about how they will how they will [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4842.36s)]
*  survive economically and time of globalization a time of innovation [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4848.28s)]
*  he sells him a bill of goods and [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4853.2s)]
*  again, their social cultural issues like gun guns and gays as they call it 3g's guns gays and [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4855.759999999999s)]
*  God, can you believe it as a mother of five and six years and seven days? I [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4863.08s)]
*  something to say about that but the [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4868.92s)]
*  This is not a person that you would even let in your house, right much less into the White House of the United States [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4873.28s)]
*  He is a vulgar [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4881.0s)]
*  grotesque [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4883.84s)]
*  He is [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4884.96s)]
*  Unpatriotic [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4887.4s)]
*  We know that he is demonstrating [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4888.639999999999s)]
*  characteristics that can be considered [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4891.5199999999995s)]
*  fascist and [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4894.44s)]
*  How people respond to him because he again he sells a good bill of goods [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4896.16s)]
*  But if his lips are moving he ain't telling the truth you came to Congress in 1987 [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4901.419999999999s)]
*  You came to Congress to fight for children and HIV AIDS [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4908.54s)]
*  What do you consider the biggest fights still ahead? [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4912.78s)]
*  You mentioned the social media earlier, mm-hmm [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4917.74s)]
*  It's not about what the fight is. It's about how the fight is conducted [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4921.74s)]
*  President [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4927.0599999999995s)]
*  Lincoln let the record show I'm quoting a Republican president [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4928.1s)]
*  President Lincoln said public sentiment is everything with it [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4931.42s)]
*  You can accomplish almost anything without it practically nothing [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4935.96s)]
*  but before public sentiment to prevail people have to know and that is what I [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4939.580000000001s)]
*  Think the challenge has been in this administration people [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4945.9400000000005s)]
*  We [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4950.42s)]
*  We did great things, but the bully pulpit of the White House did not [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4951.5s)]
*  Showcase them so that the president's numbers were like a [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4957.3s)]
*  37% so the challenge is [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4960.7s)]
*  Not the issue. The challenge is the presentation now on the issue [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4964.38s)]
*  We build consensus we reach across the aisle to try to have [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4970.34s)]
*  bipartisan support for so many things and [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4975.42s)]
*  But the public really has to be aware of that [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4979.18s)]
*  Because some of it takes a great deal of courage for our members not me because I represent beautiful San Francisco [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4983.219999999999s)]
*  But but make a deal of courage for them to vote for in their districts [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4989.7s)]
*  Especially since the other side will try to misrepresent what it is [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4994.78s)]
*  so the the the point is as I always say I can bake the pie or I can sell the pie but I can't do them both [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=4999.0199999999995s)]
*  at once so there has to be a [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5005.78s)]
*  Recognition as we did the affordable care [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5009.26s)]
*  We just went out there and mobilized and mobilized and mobilized and that's the way we passed it [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5012.1s)]
*  And that's how we saved it because of the engagement of the public [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5017.860000000001s)]
*  so I would say as we go forward there's there's a [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5022.3s)]
*  Care agenda that has to happen in our country. We are I think the only [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5026.34s)]
*  Developed nation that does not have [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5032.9800000000005s)]
*  affordable child care [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5035.5s)]
*  We the child tax credit so important home health care for our seniors family and medical leave [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5037.26s)]
*  So if you want to talk about how we can make a big difference in our economy [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5044.46s)]
*  It's the fullest [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5050.18s)]
*  empowerment of women and [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5052.5s)]
*  Caregivers they may be men too in in the workplace and we have to make sure that the public is aware of it [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5054.740000000001s)]
*  So it is not [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5061.18s)]
*  To them by the other side that does not believe in governance, right? They don't believe in science [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5063.14s)]
*  so don't do anything about climate right because [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5069.02s)]
*  You've invented the climate crisis right at the Weather Service. That's why they want to privatize it the education [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5072.46s)]
*  You have a watch the Department of Education and the EPA [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5079.02s)]
*  EPA and what is this? Okay, so let's go right to your kitchen table [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5082.820000000001s)]
*  Let's go right to your kitchen table [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5089.06s)]
*  You have to make ends meet [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5091.780000000001s)]
*  the cost of child care is huge cost of housing is huge the cost of of [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5093.900000000001s)]
*  care for your older parent or sibling or in addition to children is [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5100.1s)]
*  Is hard it's it's expensive, but it's also hard to get the kind of safe care that you need [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5106.22s)]
*  We really have to change that we had it in a bit build back better bill, right? [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5112.26s)]
*  We couldn't get it complete it completely we got most of it, but we didn't get what I just named right paid [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5117.22s)]
*  family and medical leave [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5125.1s)]
*  affordable child care child tax credit we had four hundred billion dollars in the bill for [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5127.18s)]
*  home health care for senior siblings of [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5135.26s)]
*  addition to children [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5138.820000000001s)]
*  so I think in the empowerment of women and when women succeed America succeeds and [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5140.820000000001s)]
*  We want women when they're in the workplace to be fully present. They always worry about families [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5146.299999999999s)]
*  We all do but if you have the assurance that the care is safe and good and it is affordable to you [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5151.179999999999s)]
*  I think that women will make bigger strides even and in the workplace in our economy in our [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5160.0599999999995s)]
*  national security in our [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5167.5s)]
*  Politics in our government and in academia and every way so speaking of women [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5169.54s)]
*  You ran for Congress in your late 40s [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5175.5s)]
*  Tony Morrison wrote the bluest eye in her late 40s Julia child was 49 when she published mastering the art of French cooking [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5178.219999999999s)]
*  What should women know about the second half of life? What changes as we age? Well for me my children grew up [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5186.94s)]
*  It was about them once they were in school all day and you know five children in six years and seven days [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5195.46s)]
*  That was [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoEuElLnxQs&t=5202.18s)]
