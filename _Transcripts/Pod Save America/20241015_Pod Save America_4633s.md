Video Description: "Fascist to the core." That's how Gen. Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs under Donald Trump, describes Trump in a new book—and that was before Trump's new comments about using the military against  the "enemy within." Jon, Lovett, and Tommy break down the latest and scariest from Trump, Kamala Harris's big swing state tour, and why she's attacking Trump as weak. Then, the Democratic candidate for Senate in Florida, Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, stops by to talk about why it's so important to beat Rick Scott, and what it'll take to win.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Trump’s Disturbing New Plan for Immigrants: Militarized Mass Deportations & 'Huge' Detention Camps
**Pod Save America:** [October 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo)
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Jon Favreau. I'm Jon Lovett. Tommy Vitor. On today's show with three weeks to go [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump's getting crazier, Kamala's getting bolder, and the polls are getting closer. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4.92s)]
*  We'll talk about how both campaigns are approaching the final stretch of the race and later [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=8.36s)]
*  you'll hear Tommy's interview with former congresswoman Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, the Democratic candidate running to unseat Florida Senator Rick Scott and keep the Senate in [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=11.94s)]
*  Democratic hands. But first [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=19.72s)]
*  there is a reason that Kamala Harris keeps telling us to watch Donald Trump's rallies. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=22.26s)]
*  The old man's getting darker and more deranged with each passing day. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=26.599999999999998s)]
*  Real Mad King vibes. Over the last few days [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=30.84s)]
*  he promised to liberate the occupied state of Colorado, withhold disaster aid from California just to spite Gavin Newsom, and use the U.S. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=33.4s)]
*  military to take care of Democrats. Let's listen. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=40.72s)]
*  We will have an operation Aurora at the federal level to expedite the removals of these savage gangs [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=56.36s)]
*  and I will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=63.84s)]
*  1798. Think of that. We're gonna take care of your water situation and we'll force it down his throat and [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=69.4s)]
*  we'll say Gavin if you don't do it [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=75.92s)]
*  we're not giving you any of that fire money that we send you all the time for all the forest fires that you have. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=77.84s)]
*  I think the bigger problem is the enemy from within. Not even the people that have come in and destroying our country. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=84.48s)]
*  By the way totally destroying our country. The towns and villages are being inundated. But I don't think the other problem in terms of [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=90.84s)]
*  election day. I think the bigger problem are the people from within. We have some very bad people. We have some sick people [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  radical left lunatics. And I think they're the and it should be very easily handled by if necessary by national [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=103.84s)]
*  or if really necessary by the military. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=111.84s)]
*  All right general question here. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=115.64s)]
*  Colin Trump rally is dark almost cliche at this point, but [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=118.36s)]
*  does seem like a bit of a change in tone here. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=122.64s)]
*  It's a little darker. I know we're on a sliding scale here and it's like a fascist wine tasting. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=126.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? You start with like a little light nativism and you progress like ruby red blood and soil nationalism by the end. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=130.76s)]
*  What do you make? What do you make of all that guys? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=137.6s)]
*  Let's start with the immigration stuff and then we'll move. We'll start with migrant crime and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=140.23999999999998s)]
*  liberating occupied Colorado and occupied America and then we'll move on to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=147.28s)]
*  having the National Guard handle radical left Democrats. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=151.2s)]
*  Excellent. I was also just trying to like check myself because it's like sometimes it's like is Trump getting darker or is it just fresher in my mind? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=154.64s)]
*  And so I went back and watched one of his biggest immigration speeches from 2016 [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=162.88s)]
*  just to get a sense of what he was saying then and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=169.04s)]
*  it's interesting because there's plenty of vague [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=172.4s)]
*  tilting at mass deportation. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=177.72s)]
*  But what you feel like when you feel when you go back and watch the speeches he was giving in 2016 is that they didn't [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=180.28s)]
*  know how far [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=184.95999999999998s)]
*  he could go and get away with it in two ways. One, they didn't know what they would be able to do politically. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=186.16s)]
*  They just didn't have the same people around him. But also two, they didn't know what they could get away with in terms of [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=191.12s)]
*  bringing out their supporters without alienating [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=198.0s)]
*  mainstream [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=201.44s)]
*  moderates, independents, and Democrats. And so if you look at what he was saying in 2016, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  it was much more about stopping illegal immigration and what Hillary Clinton would promise. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=208.24s)]
*  He did a lot of the but he did the same kind of oh these you know, the murderous immigrants. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=212.88s)]
*  He did the stories. He did the examples. But then he talked about targeting criminal aliens. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=216.88s)]
*  If you look at it, there's there's rhetoric there that could obviously be used to justify [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=220.88s)]
*  a claim that he's promising mass deportations, but the rhetorical excesses were just more contained. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=225.2s)]
*  And I don't think that's because Donald Trump didn't believe what he's saying now. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=230.64s)]
*  It's because I think they did not really like I think part of it is the media has gotten so much more [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=234.0s)]
*  fractured and chaotic that they don't worry as much about these remarks reaching the kind of people that would care about them. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=239.73999999999998s)]
*  But I also think that the people around Trump has changed. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=246.48s)]
*  And their expectations of what he can do once he's president have changed. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=250.16s)]
*  Yeah, I just think he always gets more inflammatory the closer we get to an election. That's true. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=254.0s)]
*  There was a quote from right before the 2016 election where he said quote [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=261.12s)]
*  Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of US sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=264.56s)]
*  her special interest friends and her donors very [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=271.2s)]
*  Chinatova very Chinatova everybody protocols the other desire there [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=273.84s)]
*  But 2018 it was all about the Kavanaugh. I do think though [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=278.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, actually both in 2018. It was the election of Kavanaugh the caravan law and order and common sense. So it was all together [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=284.23999999999995s)]
*  I think though the rhetoric now has escalated to a very different place. He's saying immigrants are animals [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=289.84s)]
*  He's saying crime is in their dna [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=296.0s)]
*  Uh later he says the FBI doesn't want more information about the assassination attempts on his life [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=298.08s)]
*  Like this is really this is like info wars to alex jones [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=302.64s)]
*  crazy [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=306.72s)]
*  Conspiratorial stuff that's also very inflammatory leads people to take violent acts, you know, I was thinking about [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=307.82s)]
*  what carlos [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=314.0s)]
*  Odeo who's at ekis research said to dan in the episode you should all listen to from over the weekend dan's polar coaster episode [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=315.44s)]
*  and [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=322.0s)]
*  When they talked about immigration, he said look I think these polls that show a slight majority of americans want [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=322.8s)]
*  Mass deportations because I can tell you from focus groups from polling and talking to latino voters that [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=329.28000000000003s)]
*  People think mass deportations has to do with the border and it has to do with illegal immigration [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=335.52s)]
*  For people who last checked in with trump a couple years ago [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  Or at least paid a lot of attention and now aren't paying a lot of attention to the news [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=345.76s)]
*  And they're they tend to be the persuadable voters. They're just checking in like [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=349.52s)]
*  You know in 2016 trump talked all about the border talked about the wall [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=354.0s)]
*  Trump's four years of president [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=358.48s)]
*  He didn't do much about illegal immigration [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=360.08s)]
*  Actually didn't really take care of illegal immigration. What he did do was he cut legal immigration 50 percent [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=362.56s)]
*  And when you hear from stephen miller when you hear from some of the authors of project 2025 stephen miller potential [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=369.44s)]
*  White house chief of staff if trump wins again [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=374.64s)]
*  What they really want to do is get into legal immigration. They want to they want to get rid of immigrants who are here legally [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=377.12s)]
*  Trump has already said that he wants [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=384.79999999999995s)]
*  The haitian immigrants in springfield who are here legally he wants to deport them [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=387.6s)]
*  When he talked about the alien enemies act [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=392.08s)]
*  That is a law that has been used in the past to round up and deport legal residents [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=394.64s)]
*  Not american citizens, but immigrants who are here legally who have legal status deport them [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=401.6s)]
*  He wants to deport the dreamers who are also here legally [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=405.12s)]
*  So this is all about he's saying migrant crime, but like if you want to go after migrant crime [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=408.24s)]
*  Police will do that in aurora the the mayor was like, yeah [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=413.44s)]
*  we have the republican mayor the republican mayor is like we we had a we had one gang in one building and the [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=416.23999999999995s)]
*  Police went after them and arrested most of the gang and that's what you do all over the country [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=423.03999999999996s)]
*  You send law enforcement out to get people who are breaking the law whether they're [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=427.2s)]
*  Uh undocumented migrants or legal citizens. I think I think there are 10 trende aragua venezuelan gang members in the building [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=430.38s)]
*  And they arrested nine of them. Yeah, that was the so discreet this problem was I i'm not surprised by the shifts in tone because [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=436.64s)]
*  I I think this is the thing he genuinely is most angry and passionate about it like genuinely seems to animate him [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=442.32s)]
*  And I think in a key makes it ostensibly. This is a conversation about immigration, but it allows him to channel his deeply [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=450.4s)]
*  Felt and rooted racist feelings into campaign rhetoric that is shocking and inflammatory [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=458.0s)]
*  But I think has been deemed acceptable by a lot of people in the republican party [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=463.44s)]
*  And i'm sure there are people in the campaign that want him to talk about other things [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=467.36s)]
*  But there's also the stephen millers of the world who do believe this is a project about [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=470.16s)]
*  Deporting people limiting immigration [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=475.68s)]
*  But you know, they kind of make it an economic argument by saying oh migrants are taking jobs or taking black jobs [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=478.72s)]
*  They're overwhelming social services [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=483.6s)]
*  He tries to backdoor it into an economic argument or a national security argument by there's terrorists coming over the border [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=485.44000000000005s)]
*  There's chinese nationals, etc [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=491.04s)]
*  Because I think it's the thing he cares about and it's also the thing that [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=493.20000000000005s)]
*  Animates the kind of hardcore base that actually goes to these rallies [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=497.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it also I think it's also worth pointing out what it's required for this argument to be politically salient like at all [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=502.24s)]
*  Like this is a myth, right? They're like aurora is safer than it's ever been [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=508.08000000000004s)]
*  Uh colorado is safer than it's ever been not occupied. It's not occupied. The sun is shining right like by jared polis [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=512.16s)]
*  By jared by it is occupied by jared polis. Uh, the gays are taking over colorado for sure. Uh, but uh, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=519.28s)]
*  Like what is required for this is that all the people getting in their pickup trucks from the server of suburbs around denver and colorado [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=525.4399999999999s)]
*  Driving in to go to this rally [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=531.76s)]
*  They either know this isn't true or don't care or they don't know it's not true because of the media they consume whether it's elon's [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=533.28s)]
*  Internet or fox news or its satellites or by the way, we should say [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=540.4s)]
*  Local news will cover an undocumented immigrant committing a crime which has happened [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=544.72s)]
*  Of course the cases he's talking about [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=550.48s)]
*  Uh lake and riley and georgia wherever else like they're real cases and they do get blown up by [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=552.5600000000001s)]
*  Not only fox but sometimes the local news. So he's like pushing on an open door here. But yeah [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=558.32s)]
*  Yeah, your point is well taken of course and and it also I think like they are relying on the fact that [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=562.88s)]
*  The kind of way the information is going to be disseminated by the time it reaches people for whom the actual details would be offensive [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=568.72s)]
*  It is boiled down to trump takes strong stance on border and immigrant crime at [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=576.1600000000001s)]
*  Uh fiery rally in colorado like they are counting on that every day because if the words that this is why kamala [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=582.48s)]
*  Harris says watch the rallies if people were seeing what was in the rallies, uh, it would be extremely unpopular [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=588.72s)]
*  It's also this is I went back and I looked at [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=593.2s)]
*  His central park five ad from the 80s when he put this [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=596.48s)]
*  You know, I think it was a full page ad in news day or you know one of those kind of like tabloid papers [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=600.5600000000001s)]
*  Um, so i've had on news. Here's some of the here's some of the language in it. Um [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=605.52s)]
*  I recently watched the newscast trying to explain the anger in these young men. I no longer want to understand their anger [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=610.16s)]
*  I want them to understand our anger [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=614.9599999999999s)]
*  I want them to be afraid criminals must be told that their civil liberties end when an attack on our safety begins [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=616.72s)]
*  This is like the longest running thread in the kind of trump [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=622.8s)]
*  narrative that he want he is a racist and he wants to punish people that don't look like him or you know, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=626.9399999999999s)]
*  Curtail civil liberties when he thinks a crime was committed. I think politically, uh, he needs huge turnout among his base [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=633.84s)]
*  Um voters cite immigration as one of their top issues [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=641.44s)]
*  Maybe the third or fourth depending on the poll and they trust him over kamala by a wider margin on immigration than any other top [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=645.12s)]
*  Issue it's almost like it's comparable to democrats focusing a lot on abortion, right? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=651.2s)]
*  Maybe the second top issue after the economy but up there. Um [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=655.28s)]
*  But I also think trump to your point on me not only is it [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=659.1999999999999s)]
*  What he really believes he also knows that it's more of an emotional appeal. Yes to people than economic [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=662.72s)]
*  Uh, arg and an economic argument because it makes people feel threatened and that's what he wants to do [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=669.36s)]
*  He must go to all these places and he wants for the people who are in the suburbs who might go to the city [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=673.4399999999999s)]
*  You don't want to go to the city. There's migrant crimp. There's migrant crime there and now it's coming to the suburbs [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=678.16s)]
*  It's coming to aurora [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=682.24s)]
*  It's coming everywhere and and that's why you got to elect me to stop the border and like if you're upset with how your [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=683.44s)]
*  Suburbs looking to your cities looking it's the migrants and it's crap [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=688.8800000000001s)]
*  This is this is what he wants to do and this is he thinks this is [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=691.84s)]
*  His best clothes better than the economy even though the economy is is, you know the top issue for [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=694.96s)]
*  most voters in every poll [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=701.2800000000001s)]
*  Um, but I don't know [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=703.0400000000001s)]
*  This is also where the paid in the urns is very different his speeches focus on immigration [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=704.8000000000001s)]
*  His paid advertising is focused on the economy the uh, the wesley and media project they track tv ads and spending [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=709.6s)]
*  They said that most of trump's ads in the last, you know week or two have been focused on economic issues like taxes and jobs [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=715.2800000000001s)]
*  The campaign has also made a big push into paid advertising attacking kamala harris on transgender rights [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=720.96s)]
*  It's that transgender criminal ad that we've all been seeing on like football games and stuff [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=727.2s)]
*  But it's just interesting that what he wants to talk about is this immigration stuff and the campaign is focused a different way [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=731.84s)]
*  Well, that brings up a question. Do we think he's making a political mistake? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=736.4000000000001s)]
*  closing on immigration because [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=740.72s)]
*  Like tommy said if if the if the campaign's thinking all right, the most effective way we can close is on the economy [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=742.72s)]
*  But he's out there [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=749.12s)]
*  Yelling about migrant crime. You know, i've been wondering if kamala harris has been doing a great job talking about [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=750.88s)]
*  Uh the border donald trump killing the border bill. She's going to sign the border bill [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=757.5200000000001s)]
*  She has not and i'm guessing it's because of some of this polling around deportation. She has not talked as much about [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=762.4799999999999s)]
*  um [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=768.4799999999999s)]
*  trump's sort of extreme stance on [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=769.36s)]
*  Deportations building camps deportation camps which by the way is like it's just a he is more extreme on immigration [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=772.14s)]
*  Than where the median voter is it just is and maybe [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=779.68s)]
*  Part of it the polling is they don't know what his stance on immigration is right now because it has it's it's in these rallies [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=783.1999999999999s)]
*  And we don't talk about them everywhere [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=788.64s)]
*  Yeah, I mean there's two questions in there. Look, I I don't know about the wisdom [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=790.64s)]
*  If there's any wisdom in his focus on immigration at the rallies [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=794.4s)]
*  I think the rallies are maybe about turnout the people coming out to a rally to see trump have already decided [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=797.68s)]
*  They love him. They believe he's better on the economy. This is about driving his most enthusiastic [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=804.72s)]
*  People to show up and maybe they rely on ads to reach the the less engaged people who just remember him as being [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=809.52s)]
*  better for the economy. I also wonder to you if part of this is [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=815.84s)]
*  Uh [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=819.28s)]
*  The comal harris campaign has done an amazing job fighting back on the economy [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=820.7199999999999s)]
*  And it's not as clear a winning issue for him [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=825.04s)]
*  But but immigration that's really is I also think it's still and we'll get to the strength weakness thing [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=827.3599999999999s)]
*  It is still a stand-in I think from the kind of connection between chaos at the border and biden being older [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=832.8s)]
*  As a kind of connection with that kind of overall failure and chaos from the biden administration [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=839.8399999999999s)]
*  And maybe they're trying to hope that that holds them all the way to election day. I don't know [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=844.4000000000001s)]
*  He really is trying to graft the campaign. He was running against joe biden [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=849.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, malharis you see he demanded she take a cognitive test today. Yeah, you just can't let go of these talking points [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=852.1600000000001s)]
*  I would if I were them think about hitting trump on this because I think she can very easily say [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=857.12s)]
*  Look, I I want to be very tough on the border [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=863.2800000000001s)]
*  I want to sign this border bill that was with the conservative republican senator, but also the idea that he's gonna [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=865.7600000000001s)]
*  Run around deporting people who are here legally who are legal residents who have done everything right just because they're immigrants like that is [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=871.1199999999999s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of talk about trouble with latino vote [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=879.92s)]
*  Forget about just latino vote white vote like people don't want that [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=882.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=885.1999999999999s)]
*  I I also think like when you talk about mass deportation you're talking about deporting millions of people [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=885.52s)]
*  Who are the parent of or married to an american citizen? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=890.0s)]
*  So you are talking about the largest family separation in american history [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=892.56s)]
*  That's what the largest mass deportation in american history would be the largest family separation in history [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=896.4799999999999s)]
*  Or kids who moved here when they were two years old and have been here for 37 years [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=900.56s)]
*  You know the we don't even talk about the dreamers anymore trump claimed at one point that he wanted to do something legislatively by executive order [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=904.3199999999999s)]
*  To protect the dreamers and now he's saying that a kid who moved to the u.s [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=910.7199999999999s)]
*  When they were one years old will be sent back to I don't know pick a country [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=915.1999999999999s)]
*  Uh that they've never been to they don't know the language. They don't have any connection [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=919.52s)]
*  I mean, it's completely inhumane. And by the way, if you think he's just bluffing he has any president has wide latitude [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=922.56s)]
*  When it comes to immigration enforcement, so [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=929.14s)]
*  Stephen milliers a lot of this a lot of this can very easily get done [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=931.86s)]
*  Yeah, like you mentioned the the the 1798 law he wants to evoke like you think that [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=935.46s)]
*  That the the conservative supreme court is going to stop trump from using this law any way he'd like [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=941.0600000000001s)]
*  I they don't think that they're not worried about that. I mean, yeah [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=945.7800000000001s)]
*  I was I was looking into this just because I was a little frightened by it and all of the like even liberal [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=948.5s)]
*  Leaning legal scholars are like there's no way the the the court has shut down [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=954.74s)]
*  people trying to use alien enemies act, uh in many instances, but [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=959.94s)]
*  either this court doesn't or [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=964.5s)]
*  Again, we are there is the scenario where the supreme court issues are ruling and donald trump is just like [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=966.9s)]
*  Yeah, why would I listen to that? Right? JD vance said on a podcast? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=972.42s)]
*  uh [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=976.42s)]
*  When he wanted to like gut the bureaucracy and said he had he would advise trump to gut the bureaucracy [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=977.22s)]
*  He said oh and then the supreme court can say no and then uh trump can say all right enforce your order [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=981.94s)]
*  Like jd vance said that yeah [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=987.62s)]
*  You and yeah send your battalions, right? Um, all right [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=990.26s)]
*  Let's talk about the other crazy shit trump said his comments, uh to maria barteromo about deploying the military against quote [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=992.9s)]
*  The enemy from within aka u.s citizens came after the news that uh, the trump administration's top general [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=998.26s)]
*  Former chairman of the joint chief's mark milley told journalist bob woodward that trump is quote fascist to the core [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1005.46s)]
*  And that quote no one has ever been as dangerous to this country as donald trump [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1011.6999999999999s)]
*  This is the chairman of the joint chiefs under donald trump his hand-picked general [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1016.66s)]
*  Uh kamala harris picked up on the news and mentioned it at her rally in north carolina this weekend [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1022.0999999999999s)]
*  Let's listen or just listen most recently to what we heard general milley said [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1026.02s)]
*  General milley chairman former chairman of the joint chiefs under donald trump. It was just reported. He said quote [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1031.54s)]
*  No one has ever been as dangerous to this country in referring to donald trump [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1039.14s)]
*  Think about that [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1047.46s)]
*  Think about that [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1049.14s)]
*  I'm thinking about it. Yeah, uh, so tim walsh also jumped on trump's comments [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1051.0600000000002s)]
*  Uh on on monday, uh just before we started recording cnn said that they're going the harris wals campaign [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1056.42s)]
*  Is going to run a 30-second ad about this the kamala harris will hit this in her rally, uh monday night [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1062.9s)]
*  um [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1070.58s)]
*  It certainly seems like the arguments that trump might actually deploy the military against american citizens, uh, and that his uh former general [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1071.54s)]
*  Which the chairman of the joint chiefs thinks he's a fascist should be compelling to persuadable voters [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1078.66s)]
*  I don't know. What do you guys think mark milley has said these sorts of things to [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1082.98s)]
*  Jeffrey goldberg at the atlantic. He's saying it to bob woodward in print form. Uh, hey man [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1086.74s)]
*  It is 2024. We gotta see your face on video. I would get what like you're saying it [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1091.78s)]
*  Say it on video. My hope is that he's gonna he's gonna do it at some point, but I don't know like [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1096.42s)]
*  Why is it why it's it's less meaningful? It's less impactful to say it in print, but it's no less true of your view [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1102.82s)]
*  You're not avoiding telling people what you think [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1108.26s)]
*  So why not do it in a way that actually has a chance to reach people who might care about it [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1110.26s)]
*  He did do that oblique reference in a commencement right after he left where he said we don't take an oath to [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1114.26s)]
*  Dictators or want to be dictators and because there's a little too oblique. Yeah. Oh this the 2024 is all about subtlety like [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1120.1799999999998s)]
*  And by the way, because of drums like the migrants are slitting our throats [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1128.4199999999998s)]
*  There's such a lack of video of milley saying these sorts of things that they use that in an ad just the same even though he's saying [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1132.7399999999998s)]
*  Uh far more direct things in other forms and I don't understand that there's an admirable [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1138.6599999999999s)]
*  thing you hear a lot from like former three stars and four star generals that they don't want to be involved in politics and they [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1144.02s)]
*  Believe strongly in the military's apolitical role in our society and their commitment is to the constitution [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1149.14s)]
*  But once you blur that line and you say it on the record to bob woodward [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1155.7s)]
*  Like what are we doing here? You have to sit down and do this on camera [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1160.66s)]
*  It doesn't have to be a campaign ad do it in a in an interview with a friendly reporter [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1163.7800000000002s)]
*  And then the campaign will cut that and put it in a tv ad. You know what I mean? It doesn't have to be like [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1169.22s)]
*  overtly partisan necessarily also [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1173.14s)]
*  Where's john kelly his former chief of staff who has said in a number of interviews he's dangerous. He's unfit [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1175.46s)]
*  He's he's crazy [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1182.74s)]
*  Um or mattis jim mattis the former defective secretary of defense like there's a lot of people and I also think this helps with [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1184.42s)]
*  like one of the big challenges [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1190.8200000000002s)]
*  for the harris wall's campaign is reaching people who are like [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1193.38s)]
*  You know what? We survived a first term of donald trump [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1197.5400000000002s)]
*  And everyone said he was going to be a dictator stuff like that and you know january 6 was [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1201.06s)]
*  horrendous and he tried to return the election but like [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1205.62s)]
*  You know, we survived things are okay and it's like oh everyone's got trump amnesia. Well milley says to woodward [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1207.86s)]
*  You know, I glimpsed this when I talked to you a few years ago [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1214.26s)]
*  This was like right before he left the trump administration before everything really went crazy. He goes, but now I know it [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1218.1s)]
*  No one has ever been as dangerous now. I now I realize he's a total fascist and I do think [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1224.1799999999998s)]
*  That the part of the message in the final weeks is the trump you think you know [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1229.46s)]
*  Who you don't like and you think is a little crazy has deteriorated so much more [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1235.14s)]
*  And it's so much more unstable and more dangerous than he was before [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1240.02s)]
*  And all of the guardrails are gone this time all the only people that are left [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1243.7s)]
*  Are like the most at best grifters and at worst fascists. Yeah, the other part of this too [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1248.02s)]
*  Like it's not the most important point but all these people saying like [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1253.46s)]
*  Guys trump was president and he said all this stuff, but he actually didn't do it [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1257.3000000000002s)]
*  It's like what kind of point you think you're making like he's the worst person in the world saying he wants to do terrible things [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1260.66s)]
*  Because he believes the american people really want it, but he doesn't really mean it like why what what kind of defense is that? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1266.02s)]
*  That's a character thing. I mean the john kelly stuff that you mentioned earlier who is his chief of staff [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1271.22s)]
*  Yeah, this is like a quote he sent to jake tapper [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1276.02s)]
*  Uh a person that did not be talking about trump a person that did not want to be seen in the presidents of military [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1278.5s)]
*  Amputies because quote it does not look good for me. I mean you're talking about a person who is so [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1283.1399999999999s)]
*  Narcissistic and self-absorbed that he wouldn't be photographed with military amputees when he's the commander in chief [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1289.04s)]
*  That's not like a you know endorsement thing. That's not a it's not partisan. It's just like [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1294.02s)]
*  You're a bad person. That's like the guy in 2020 [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1299.3799999999999s)]
*  Donald trump had peaceful protesters in lafayette park tear gassed and he asked if he could have them shot [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1303.1399999999999s)]
*  And then he was told no by some of the same people who are now telling us that he is a fascist [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1308.74s)]
*  He says repeatedly he wants to use the federal government to punish people who don't support him [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1313.22s)]
*  He says he wants to use the national guard in the military against people who protest him his advisors say that too [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1317.22s)]
*  They wrote it down in project 2025 and it's like yeah, maybe he's just bluffing [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1321.86s)]
*  You know, maybe there's a chance maybe the military will refuse even though he's going to replace the leadership of the military with [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1326.5s)]
*  His people with loyalists. Maybe the supreme court will stop him. Maybe he'll obey their ruling [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1331.62s)]
*  Maybe it'll all be fine, but it's like do you want to take that risk? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1335.94s)]
*  Do you want to take that risk for what? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1339.14s)]
*  so um [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1340.74s)]
*  Because you think that his economic policy of taxing imported goods and drilling for oil and repealing obamacare is going to put more money [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1342.26s)]
*  In your pocket. That's the risk you want to take you want to lower roll the dice you want to lower a lower top marginal rate? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1348.42s)]
*  And fewer environmental regulations, maybe he's just bluffing. Yeah, maybe but like why are you playing russian roulette now? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1353.94s)]
*  Well, there was a piece in the times about uh trump supporters don't really believe what he said and there was this sentence [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1359.54s)]
*  Really jumped out at me which was um, there were rough edges in his remarks and some talk of a stolen election [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1364.8999999999999s)]
*  But mostly he made them feel content in their choice to vote for him some rough edges [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1369.9399999999998s)]
*  about about stealing of stealing the election and you you look at what these [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1374.34s)]
*  uh kind of uh economic elites that want to support trump say and [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1378.6599999999999s)]
*  You can describe it as not really believing him but really it's about pretending [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1382.58s)]
*  He's not saying what he's saying or or hearing what he's saying and saying he's not going to do it because they don't really care [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1385.62s)]
*  That they they want their they want their tax cuts they want their deregulation and they will soothe their own [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1391.86s)]
*  Psychology about their morally depraved choice any way they can yeah, I read that times piece [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1398.6399999999999s)]
*  I think I think that sentiment is true for like a subset of the kind of donor class of supporters because this was a speech [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1403.3s)]
*  To the detroit economic club [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1410.1799999999998s)]
*  so it doesn't surprise me that those people don't think that trump will lock up as political enemies or [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1411.86s)]
*  Or maybe that they just won't kind of entertain the thought because they don't it's inconvenient for them to think about it [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1417.7800000000002s)]
*  The people who go to your standard trump rally absolutely want him to punish his enemies. Yeah, they think he will and they want it [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1423.5400000000002s)]
*  They're cheering it up. They've been chanting lock her up for like a decade now. They're waiting for it to happen [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1429.5400000000002s)]
*  They all saw what happened on january 6 and they're like, yeah more of that. You know, the question is [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1433.8600000000001s)]
*  The persuadable voters that are left the people who haven't made up their minds whether they're voting for trump or they're voting at all [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1439.8600000000001s)]
*  And and don't consume that much news. Do they even know right and I and I think that they don't [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1445.3s)]
*  Do they care? I think is a fair question. They care is a fair question [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1451.06s)]
*  But like do they believe it do they care do they know do they believe it? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1453.54s)]
*  Do they care I was gonna say and before we get to do they believe it and do they care we first have to [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1456.74s)]
*  We first have to find out if they know and I think there has been no concerted effort to make sure they know [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1461.46s)]
*  And I don't blame the harris walls campaign for this [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1467.54s)]
*  I don't even necessarily blame the media for this because we're just inundated with bullshit all the time [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1470.02s)]
*  And again trump is hiding we're gonna talk about this in a second, but he's hiding from the press [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1474.82s)]
*  and so what you get is [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1478.9s)]
*  Supporters sort of just either saying they like it or ignoring it or you get supporters like, um, virginia governor glen yonkin [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1481.44s)]
*  Um trying to pretend that trump never said it in this interview with jake tapper. Let's play clip [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1488.26s)]
*  I don't think that he's referring to elected people in in in in america [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1493.3s)]
*  But I'm literally reading his quotes. I'm literally reading his quotes to you and I played them earlier [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1497.78s)]
*  So you could hear that they were not made up by me [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1503.3799999999999s)]
*  He's literally talking about quote radical left lunatics and then one of those lunatics he addressed he mentioned was congressman adams shift [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1506.02s)]
*  every [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1513.44s)]
*  Criminals should be locked up [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1514.8999999999999s)]
*  Migrants who are in this country illegally? [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1517.28s)]
*  Uh who are violent should be locked up and deported I grant you all of that and I am not denying that it's happening at all [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1519.94s)]
*  So i'm talking about but i'm talking about donald trump saying that he wants to use the national guard in the military to go after [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1526.1s)]
*  The left that's what he's saying. I I don't I don't believe that's what he's saying [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1532.6599999999999s)]
*  But listen you and I are going to argue about that [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1536.5s)]
*  But I would I would suggest if you would also play the quote and I read it to you if you would also balance [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1538.26s)]
*  Wish that he weren't saying that but that's what he's saying [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1543.1399999999999s)]
*  I can't there I have not time. It's happening everywhere people are taking people's they're taking words [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1546.1799999999998s)]
*  They're playing the words for people [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1551.06s)]
*  They're just they're taking trump out of context at the thing [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1552.58s)]
*  He is saying repeatedly at multiple campaign stops as part of his closing message [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1554.9799999999998s)]
*  I I really don't think i've seen like a better encapsulation of what like quote [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1559.22s)]
*  Establishment end quote republicans have done to get behind trump in this interview. It's pretending [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1564.96s)]
*  He's not saying the shit he's saying every day [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1569.6200000000001s)]
*  It's doing the intellectual zamboni work to to say like actually it's about uh, uh immigration [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1571.6200000000001s)]
*  When he's talking about putting adam schiff in prison, it's like send the military after adam schiff. He couldn't be more clear [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1578.3400000000001s)]
*  Also, I didn't realize this because it wasn't covered in the aurora rally [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1584.3400000000001s)]
*  He says the same thing about enemy from within me from it's in the remarks [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1588.5800000000002s)]
*  It's in the remarks [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1592.1000000000001s)]
*  It's part of his prepared text and I guess like if if you played a clip of that interview for donald trump and then asked him [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1592.9s)]
*  What do you think about what glen yonkin say he'd be like glen yonkin's wrong. I meant to go after americans today [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1599.94s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, he called glen yonkin a fag. That's what he would do [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1604.74s)]
*  Which says I mean he literally says to me about barter no [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1607.8600000000001s)]
*  There's the outside enemy and then the enemy within and he's talking about democrats. Yeah, he's specifically saying it's very clear [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1610.34s)]
*  It's it's he yes, I just [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1616.18s)]
*  You know, i'm glad they're making an ad put it in front of voters put it in a speech [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1618.98s)]
*  Put it in front of I guess the question is like have they put this in an ad before and have they tested it and people [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1622.34s)]
*  Are like if you're a low information voter [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1626.98s)]
*  Maybe there's a version where you're like, I don't care what these kind of partisans do to each other [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1629.3s)]
*  I don't know what they're talking about. I'm trying to pay my bills [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1634.1s)]
*  I'm not saying like I know that to be too [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1635.86s)]
*  I'm just like thinking aloud because these the people running the campaign are not idiots, right? [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1637.3799999999999s)]
*  They're gonna do whatever tests best. Um, and we're not suggesting that it's just i'm wondering [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1641.3s)]
*  I don't know. You have to wonder how it plays and maybe this new ad they're gonna do today is to drive media coverage of this [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1645.62s)]
*  so I think that [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1651.54s)]
*  It is well known that a lot of January 6th [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1654.02s)]
*  themed ads [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1657.54s)]
*  um for lack of a better [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1659.3s)]
*  description [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1661.36s)]
*  Have not moved people as much because everyone's like it's in the past, right? [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1662.6599999999999s)]
*  It's or you know, joe biden was out there, you know [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1666.58s)]
*  John meacham writing his speeches talking about democracy and the threat to democracy and it's very like up here [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1669.3s)]
*  And you know, it's not really grounded for people [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1674.1s)]
*  I think this is two things about this that I think could make it persuadable could make it effective [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1676.5s)]
*  One it's new information. We put new information in front of voters [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1681.9399999999998s)]
*  Um that is more likely to get them to move. They have not heard this exact comment from donald trump before [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1685.54s)]
*  It is new you can put it in front of voters and it also is about [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1691.62s)]
*  It's it's not uh, like an idea like saving democracy like it's an idea [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1695.38s)]
*  It's donald trump if you don't support him wants to or if you go protest him or whatever [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1699.5400000000002s)]
*  Wants to send the national guard and military out into the streets [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1704.66s)]
*  Like I just I don't sometimes you mean we can pull it for sure and i'm sure that the campaign will pull it [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1707.46s)]
*  But in the final three weeks, who knows if they attend to test it [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1712.02s)]
*  It's like, you know what? You got to go with your gut on this one [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1714.5800000000002s)]
*  We'll get to the trump strategy in a second about whether and how they're hiding trump from the public, but I do think this is [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1716.8200000000002s)]
*  Not just about persuading people [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1723.62s)]
*  Uh to vote for comel harris or to not vote for trump or stay home [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1725.7s)]
*  I also think that there are millions of democrats [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1729.7s)]
*  Who need to be reminded of the stakes and the people that are going to be most outraged and may hear about this [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1732.1799999999998s)]
*  They're gonna make calls. They're gonna knock on doors. They're gonna care about this [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1736.6599999999999s)]
*  They're gonna get their friends to vote like part of this is like [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1739.86s)]
*  This is this needs to like kind of remind everybody [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1743.78s)]
*  Paying attention just how dangerous donald trump will be in the second term to try to get everybody out to do their part [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1747.3s)]
*  If I was talking to someone I knew who was wavering or I was on a door i'd bring this up [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1751.78s)]
*  Yeah, and it was like a couple days before the election [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1755.78s)]
*  I'd I'd talk about abortion bans. I'd talk about repealing health care and i'd be like, oh, yeah [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1758.26s)]
*  And by the way, did you hear him say he wants to send out the military? [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1761.78s)]
*  Yeah, I guess there's just there's a bunch of people who think he's not really gonna do that [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1765.1399999999999s)]
*  I mean, we just heard some of them. They don't think they don't believe it. They don't think it's real the [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1768.4199999999998s)]
*  Response is always what about ism actually they're going after me. I have four criminal cases. They're trying to lock me up [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1772.26s)]
*  They're going after my business. So [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1777.54s)]
*  You guys could be right i'm just trying to straw man the other side of it, which is there's a lot there's a constant [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1779.78s)]
*  You know endless stream of rhetoric about how dangerous donald trump [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1785.3799999999999s)]
*  Is or will be for the last nine or ten years and I think people tune out some of it even when it's quotes from him [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1789.7s)]
*  And maybe that's the case here and maybe why we aren't seeing it more or maybe this is really compelling [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1794.74s)]
*  And we're gonna see a lot of this. Yeah, I just I think it's not [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1799.54s)]
*  I get it. I have the feeling it's not getting in front of voters. So we just we haven't tested it yet [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1802.5s)]
*  Um, so let's talk about comal harris. She is currently in the middle of a campaign swing that's taking her to [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1806.98s)]
*  Pennsylvania michigan back to pennsylvania then to wisconsin then back to michigan onto georgia several stops in most places [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1812.34s)]
*  Uh, she's going all over the place. She's also doing a lot more interviews [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1818.6599999999999s)]
*  Um, she was in the she did the shade room. She did roland martin and then on wednesday [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1822.58s)]
*  She is doing an interview with brett baer of fox news weird [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1828.26s)]
*  Um one big theme of hers over the last couple days, uh that trump is weak and scared. Let's take a listen [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1832.18s)]
*  But here's the thing north carolina and he's not being transparent with the voters [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1838.26s)]
*  He's not being transparent. So check this out [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1842.98s)]
*  He refuses to release his medical records [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1846.18s)]
*  I've done it [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1850.34s)]
*  Every other presidential camp every other presidential candidate in modern era has done it [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1853.06s)]
*  He is unwilling to do a 60 minutes interview [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1860.26s)]
*  Like every other major party candidate has done for more than half a century [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1867.46s)]
*  He is unwilling to meet for a second debate [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1875.7s)]
*  And here's the thing here's the thing it makes you wonder [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1884.82s)]
*  It makes you wonder [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1889.8600000000001s)]
*  Why does his staff want him to hide away? [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1892.42s)]
*  One must question one must question are they afraid that people will see that he is too weak and unstable [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1899.3s)]
*  To lead america [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1909.7s)]
*  One must answer yes one must answer if you're afraid of leslie stall, how can you deal with latimer putin? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1912.5800000000002s)]
*  uh, so if uh again, but pluff talked about this on with dan on sunday's psa, uh, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1919.54s)]
*  He was teasing that the strong leader question is something that's popping with voters in their data [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1926.66s)]
*  He also talked to new york magazine [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1932.42s)]
*  and he said [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1934.74s)]
*  Uh, the thing to think about is his increasing instability project 2025 the notion of a trump with no guardrails with a desire for unchecked power [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1936.18s)]
*  We've talked about that. We've run ads on that [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1942.9s)]
*  We're going to continue to emphasize that in the end [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1944.5s)]
*  Because that worries all the voters who are remaining out there who haven't decided yet who to vote for [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1946.5s)]
*  And he said really raising the risk profile of the trump second term is a very important piece of business for us to execute well on [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1951.14s)]
*  Here's the question [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1956.9s)]
*  How it seems that this could be in tension, right with trump is weak [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1958.8200000000002s)]
*  He is an unserious person. He is like [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1964.3400000000001s)]
*  Whatever the weak stuff, but then also the risk is great. Like I don't know how you do both of those [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1967.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I see. I think that's where the unstable piece comes in and I think they have to do both right like trump is a real threat [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1973.78s)]
*  He's unstable. He's promising chaos. He's promising all these evil policies [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1979.06s)]
*  But you don't want that to lean into he's a strong man, right? [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1982.82s)]
*  Because he's weak because he's depraved because he's unstable. He's going to pursue this extreme and radical and dangerous [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1985.78s)]
*  agenda, I also like [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1992.5s)]
*  you know [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1994.1000000000001s)]
*  It's just true like it's just a very true argument and like the fact that he's gotten away with being pulling ahead of [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=1995.7s)]
*  Uh democrats whether it's biden or kamala on being strong for so long [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2001.78s)]
*  It is just a place to attack because it's so obviously false on its face once you [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2005.62s)]
*  Think about it engage with it for even one second and like they have they're they're beating him on on abortion [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2010.4199999999998s)]
*  They're fighting to a draw [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2017.7s)]
*  on the economy there [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2019.7s)]
*  As you as pluff pointed out that they're doing better on those questions about who fights for you and who fights for the middle class [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2021.62s)]
*  Uh immigration is a tough issue [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2027.06s)]
*  character [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2029.12s)]
*  Leadership strength like that's the last place where they need to kind of fight this kind of battle and win that battle [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2030.32s)]
*  She's calling him a wimp [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2036.56s)]
*  Pluff is saying he might be too strong [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2038.1599999999999s)]
*  Maybe the strong man you don't like kind of leader. It is a very different argument. It's like what what I heard in her [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2041.52s)]
*  Lines there was I know you're gonna hear this [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2048.24s)]
*  I think you're a fucking wimp and i'm gonna try to bait you into doing some things that is stupid for you to do [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2051.36s)]
*  right, um [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2056.56s)]
*  Plus broader point though about like strength in politics. I mean, this is a perennial thing. It's a cliche [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2058.0s)]
*  It's like we need a president who can face down putin or xi jian ping or some autocrat [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2062.56s)]
*  Um understanding what that means manifests in a lot of ways, you know part of these talk about height they used to talk about [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2066.54s)]
*  Uh military experience, uh, there's obviously it's like gendered overtones to the whole thing [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2072.32s)]
*  Um, so I I don't know. I mean I like her argument there [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2078.24s)]
*  I like her saying come out of your safe space you fucking loser. I'm sitting here waiting for you. Let's do a debate [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2082.24s)]
*  Let's do 60 minutes. Let's do whatever [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2087.44s)]
*  I don't know if it's a a message that's designed to move voters or just to get him to react like the line she had in [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2090.16s)]
*  The debate. Yeah, and you know what these things aren't necessarily neat [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2095.28s)]
*  Like it's a good campaign like you could be trying to bait him [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2099.6s)]
*  And then you do that but you still got to raise the risk profile of a trump second term with persuadable voters [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2103.12s)]
*  Because I do think telling a persuadable voter. Oh you think trump's strong actually he's weak [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2108.56s)]
*  Is not like especially when they saw the the bloody face fist pump photo, you know, right [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2114.2400000000002s)]
*  I just think it's like you're just you can try to redefine strength and weakness real strength is this that you can do all that [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2118.48s)]
*  Um, but you know, it seems a little complicated. You might as well just tell people oh, uh, he's gonna send out the guard to shoot people [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2125.6s)]
*  Yeah [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2132.56s)]
*  And also he's hiding. I also think that like both are true. The other part of the the he's a wimp [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2133.52s)]
*  He's hiding thing is it's just catnip for reporters [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2137.92s)]
*  And I do think that like one place where the trump campaign [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2140.8s)]
*  And the harris campaign have a kind of similar theory about how the media works right now [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2143.92s)]
*  Is that it's very hard to break through in a bunch of ways [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2147.76s)]
*  But like the overall like kind of mood music does matter [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2150.08s)]
*  It does right and like I think like the trump people are counting on that [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2153.52s)]
*  I think the harris campaign in this case, it's like a bunch of stories about how trump's not doing press [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2157.04s)]
*  He's not out there kind of sets a narrative that I think is really [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2161.2000000000003s)]
*  Unhelpful for him. I mean when it was biden and trump [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2164.78s)]
*  We would always say that when the news is about biden [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2168.32s)]
*  biden's a little down when the news is about trump trump's a little down it was different when kamala took over because [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2171.28s)]
*  She is a new candidate who was largely undefined [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2177.1200000000003s)]
*  So when it was about her it was good because we had to define her [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2179.92s)]
*  I think at this stage in the campaign we are back to [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2183.44s)]
*  If we're going to get a week about kamala news like we did last week [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2186.32s)]
*  It was like is she going to do the interviews then she did the interviews [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2189.6800000000003s)]
*  Did she have a gaffe in one of the interview right? Like and I think now it's a question in the final three weeks of like [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2192.0s)]
*  What are we talking about in the last week of the election? [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2196.64s)]
*  Is it something that trump did wrong something that trump said or is it some mistake that kamala made and I think that we need [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2199.12s)]
*  It to be about trump in the final weeks. I don't know. What do you guys think? [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2205.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, no, I think I think that's right. I also think that like anytime [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2209.52s)]
*  Look, sure. They're in conflict, you know, she's saying he's a wimp [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2213.92s)]
*  Promising this extreme and dangerous authoritarianism, but at the same time like [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2218.96s)]
*  Donald trump like to donald trump's base his rambling nonsense on the stump is his kind of defiant persona [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2223.92s)]
*  But the more people seeing those clips on television think less like oh [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2231.44s)]
*  There's that kind of guy that took on the system and more like there's that rambling old man again [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2235.44s)]
*  I think the more his strengths look like weaknesses and I think there is like real value to that [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2240.48s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I don't know if if it matters most if it's the stories about him or her in the closing weeks [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2244.96s)]
*  I do think there's like a very real thing that happens in the final week or two of a campaign where the vibe [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2250.56s)]
*  Helped like leads the remaining undecideds to break en masse and in 2016 [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2256.48s)]
*  It was the comey letter [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2262.32s)]
*  And we all felt that and maybe hillary clinton would have lost anyway, and I just I don't know what 2020 [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2263.84s)]
*  It would have been hunter's laptop [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2268.0800000000004s)]
*  Had they not silenced had they not done election interference the obsession about that is the funniest thing to me [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2270.0800000000004s)]
*  Like the idea that people were just sitting around wondering what joe biden's son was up to anyway [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2275.84s)]
*  But yeah, i'm worried about that and I think that could be you know based on some sort of campaign tactic [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2281.1200000000003s)]
*  It'd be a gaffe that one of them does or it could be some exigent event [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2286.32s)]
*  You know it could be the israelis launching some massive attack on iran and this scary war in the middle east [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2289.36s)]
*  It's happening right now. It gets a lot scarier and everyone's like oh man [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2295.6000000000004s)]
*  This didn't happen when trump was in charge and that narrative like takes hold and works. So yeah, it's um [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2298.7200000000003s)]
*  Precarious jack smith jumps out of a bush with another indictment [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2304.64s)]
*  So one thing that the both campaigns also seem to agree on is that hiding trump is the right strategy [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2309.6s)]
*  For trump the washington post report over the weekend trump's team has embraced bravado as it tries to keep its candidate on message [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2317.7599999999998s)]
*  Fail and encourage him to avoid the sort of high-profile national audiences that might motivate harris's supporters [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2324.4s)]
*  That might motivate harris's supporters so [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2331.7599999999998s)]
*  harris wants him in the national spotlight [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2335.04s)]
*  trump's team [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2337.68s)]
*  Doesn't want him in the national spotlight [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2338.88s)]
*  Uh, so do we think more trump worse for trump? [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2341.12s)]
*  Uh, yeah, I think [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2345.36s)]
*  More trump in the form of the trump we're seeing at trump's rallies is not good for don trump the that or the interviews [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2347.04s)]
*  well, I think that like the interviews that are less contentious like the [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2353.52s)]
*  The kind of podcast interviews he's doing like those are the places where he is reaching a lot of people if not millions of people [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2357.52s)]
*  In a way that is I think not as harmful not harmful or just out not helpful for him [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2363.6800000000003s)]
*  um, so I think they're counting on [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2368.6400000000003s)]
*  That and then counting on kind of negative [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2371.28s)]
*  Partisanship and ad blitzes to do the work for them [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2374.54s)]
*  I don't it's funny. He does his safe space interviews [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2378.2400000000002s)]
*  And he doesn't get any tough questions, but he also kind of lets his freak flag fly [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2380.96s)]
*  I know a little bit, you know, like when he's with maria barteromo. He seems to think it's just them talking. Yep [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2385.04s)]
*  When he talks to hu hu it his little right wing foreign policy nixon goon [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2390.48s)]
*  He just makes shit up like that. He visited the gaza strip or that jews are responsible for anti-semitism on college campuses [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2395.04s)]
*  You know, so he's only he's only he's best actually when it's a one of those podcasters [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2401.3599999999997s)]
*  Who's not necessarily like the biggest trump fan, but is not going to ask tough questions like like george stefanopoulos or something like that [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2406.56s)]
*  Those people he actually is like, oh I better be on my best behavior and i'm gonna tell a personal story [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2413.76s)]
*  Right. He's been told before those interviews that this is not a political space [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2418.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, so just like shoot the shit and try to be friendly. Yeah, ask the ovon about cocaine right? [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2421.44s)]
*  I do think there's a difference [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2426.32s)]
*  between [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2428.0s)]
*  Voters hearing about trump and voters hearing from trump [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2429.28s)]
*  Yeah, like I think that's a big difference because when we when all the polling and the research is like, oh people are sick about [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2432.8s)]
*  Trump they already made up their mind about trump part of it is they have heard people [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2437.92s)]
*  Complain about trump like us people [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2442.16s)]
*  For the last nine years and some of it has gotten a little hysterical and not believable [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2444.56s)]
*  And people are low trust anyway, especially the people who are left don't trust institutions that much [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2448.8799999999997s)]
*  So I think it's much more this is like the whole my whole [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2453.52s)]
*  Theory of why the conviction and the trial didn't play as well because it wasn't we weren't hearing from trump [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2456.56s)]
*  We were seeing trump in a courtroom and a bunch of people saying bad shit about trump when you hear from trump directly [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2462.08s)]
*  You're like, oh, yeah, that guy's not he's not all there. He's not he's not a good hitspace [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2467.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2472.24s)]
*  Yeah, there's also like I think that that narrow sliver of people who are going to make up their minds at the end like [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2473.12s)]
*  They're not hearing [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2479.68s)]
*  I mean [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2480.96s)]
*  They've heard kind of whatever through us most the kind of the the the the endless noise about trump has of course reached everybody [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2481.8399999999997s)]
*  But like they haven't really been engaged yet and they're going to engage right at the very end [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2489.3599999999997s)]
*  And I think it's a mix like I think people like that's why I think it matters if mark milley doesn't add [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2494.3199999999997s)]
*  I think that's why it matters. Um [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2498.72s)]
*  If people are getting the worst version of trump in front of them right at the end because I wouldn't be surprised if the harris wals [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2501.3599999999997s)]
*  Campaign like does a 60 second big ad everywhere possible and swing states at the very end [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2507.4399999999996s)]
*  That's just trump in his own words at rallies. I mean I she said watch the rallies they have the money to put it in front [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2512.3999999999996s)]
*  Of people, you know [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2518.24s)]
*  So again check out [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2520.24s)]
*  dance episode from sunday [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2522.8799999999997s)]
*  One thing we just wanted to play. Uh, it was when when pluff [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2525.2799999999997s)]
*  Um gave us this piece of uh, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2528.88s)]
*  Insight about the early vote numbers. We like what we're seeing in the early vote data so far [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2532.0s)]
*  We particularly like what we're not seeing on the trump data, which is there's not an army [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2536.8s)]
*  Of kind of incels showing up in early voting history. So [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2541.04s)]
*  Uh, you know, maybe they'll show up on election day. We'll see but [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2545.36s)]
*  Army, what do we do if there's an army of incels? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2548.48s)]
*  Gotta fuck them distract one by one. You just gotta bang them. Yeah turn those frogs into princes [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2551.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, they're not incels anymore. That's how we heal this country. Yeah [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2556.24s)]
*  Get throw put a put a ps put a ps5 [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2559.6s)]
*  It was the most pluff quote because it was just like is like in another answer. He just like slips it in there [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2563.4399999999996s)]
*  Yeah, that was the other one 1.5x there. Was that just him normal? [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2569.6s)]
*  The other one is like 1.5x [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2573.52s)]
*  He slipped in that um, the reason that trump is doing coachella in new york is that he's not getting turnout [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2577.12s)]
*  Yeah at his rallies in swing states [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2581.68s)]
*  One one other point that i haven't seen made about like the trump bravado thing about how they think they're winning and they're hiding them [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2583.9199999999996s)]
*  It is a little bit of signaling [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2588.3199999999997s)]
*  that [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2590.72s)]
*  Look, they don't have a big field operation and yet they're as as pluff pointed out. They're relying on these low information [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2591.68s)]
*  low turnout voters [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2597.68s)]
*  Their whole strategy is around what happens [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2599.9199999999996s)]
*  After the election and trying to prevent votes from being counted and I do think part of what they're signaling to their millions of of hardcore [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2602.3999999999996s)]

*  I don't know because donald trump is the possibility [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2673.8399999999997s)]
*  Of you know, a cra a more crazy trump than we've ever seen before [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2678.16s)]
*  Why are lab monkeys neurotic because you're poking them every day with a fucking stick. So that's why we're nervous [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2683.92s)]
*  And also this is a man who's like instinct has always been to punish his enemies, right and now he's gone through this period [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2688.3199999999997s)]

*  rightly or wrongly mostly wrongly that he was unfairly targeted by the courts and by lawfare and that [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2695.52s)]
*  Democrats and he keeps saying that democrats were behind the assassination attempts and if he sincerely believed that and he seems to [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2701.02s)]
*  Imagine what he will do [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2708.3199999999997s)]
*  Imagine what that motivates you to do and again all I keep thinking is like yeah [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2710.0s)]
*  Is it possible that donald trump just uh watches his tivo and drinks his diet coke for the next four years possibly but like [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2713.2799999999997s)]

*  If he was gonna lead the military tribunal to execute [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2728.96s)]
*  Political enemies of donald trump essentially execute and he and he was like, you know what mike flinn said in response [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2732.3999999999996s)]

*  Let's leave it all out on the field first. We gotta win first. We gotta win [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2741.52s)]
*  Then we'll get to that other stuff and donald trump has said he wants mike flinn back in another administration joe arpaio [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2744.4s)]
*  92 I don't know how well he'd serve wants him back to is he on trial but these are like donald trump is one man [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2750.6200000000003s)]
*  And yes, he'd be the president with like a lot of power [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2756.5600000000004s)]
*  But like just don't tell your friends who are not worried about donald trump again [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2758.4s)]
*  The fucking cast of characters around him are just the worst of the worst and like is it yeah [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2762.6400000000003s)]
*  Is it possible all this is wrong that that that that he doesn't ever actually deliver on all this sure again [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2768.0s)]
*  By the way, you want to roll the dice that were that that adam shipp is requesting vegan meals at some fucking federal institution [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2773.28s)]
*  Because you think those fucking tariffs are magic and suddenly you're gonna have more money in your pocket because the tariffs on imported goods [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2779.44s)]
*  That's his only economic policy. Let me reread this verbatim quote of the mike flinn thing just because it's worth [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2784.2400000000002s)]
*  Thank you. He was at the rod of iron freedom festival. No among us was so haven't gone to that [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2788.64s)]
*  He was asked if he'd quote sit at the head of a military tribunal to not only drain the swamp [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2793.44s)]
*  But imprison the swamp and on a few occasions execute the slow just a few that was the question [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2797.2799999999997s)]
*  Flynn it's a long answer [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2802.16s)]
*  He says what your sentiment is about is accountability and I believe we need accountability and then he basically ends it with [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2803.68s)]
*  These people are already light up to no good [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2809.12s)]
*  So we got to win first we win and then katie bar the door [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2811.12s)]
*  Believe me the gates of hell my hell will be unleashed and the questioner was not named katie [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2814.48s)]
*  And that was not katie at no point in this answer does he say to this man sir [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2820.08s)]
*  Extrajudicial murder murder of political enemies is a bad thing [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2824.6200000000003s)]
*  You have to go you have to go to the gates of hell you open your own gates of hell [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2829.28s)]
*  You have a personal gates of hell, but he's thought that through much like the tribunals [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2833.28s)]
*  So anyway, that's what we're facing. That's why democrats are nervous, but you know what? [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2837.76s)]
*  If you're nervous go do something the only only early vote indicator [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2841.76s)]
*  You're going to get that means something is either from john ralston or david plough in the incels [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2845.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, right. That's it forget about the other votes the polls at this point. It's tied everyone's like, oh, you know [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2849.6s)]
*  We were up and now we're down. No, no, it's not true. We thought we were up. We were tied now [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2855.44s)]
*  People think we're down. We're tied. It's a tied race. That's what plub thinks [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2859.84s)]
*  Basically the trump campaign even when they released their internals last week [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2863.52s)]
*  That was it was margin of error tied even those internals weren't like trump having a commanding lead in all those states [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2867.52s)]
*  So like both campaigns pretty much see a tied race within the margin of error depending on turnout models and that's probably [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2872.8s)]
*  Most likely that's where we're going to be on election day and early vote can only tell you so much [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2878.8s)]
*  Uh, which is not much of anything and the polls at this point can only tell you so much [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2883.6s)]
*  Yeah, there will be no reassurance between now and election day. None nothing by the way [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2887.92s)]
*  There are also been likely no reason to have some sudden belief that it's over right like either direction like this feeling this terrible anxiety [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2892.72s)]
*  That's it between now and election day [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2900.72s)]
*  And the only question is whether or not you're willing to actually finally do something in these last few weekends [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2902.08s)]
*  Before the election because most of you haven't done a fucking thing. Well, you know we say katie knock the door katie [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=2907.44s)]

*  But I just did want to start by asking how florida's faring after these hurricanes first. It was helene then milton. How are you guys doing? [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3291.46s)]
*  Tommy it's been so heartbreaking to see the devastation all across our state [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3299.3799999999997s)]
*  I had just been in the st. Pete area after hurricane helene last week and I had visited areas where [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3303.46s)]
*  They experienced flooding that they really were not expecting and it displaced over 16 000 people that lost their home [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3310.74s)]
*  After hurricane helene and then we were immediately preparing for another devastating storm [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3318.1000000000004s)]
*  milton was [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3324.02s)]
*  Catastrophic and it wasn't just that it brought storm surge to some of the areas in the west coast of florida [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3326.0s)]
*  but [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3331.0600000000004s)]
*  A lot of the tornadoes that hit ground on the east side of our state [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3331.78s)]
*  Caused so much damage. I was just today visiting an area in wellington here in florida close to palm beach where [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3337.38s)]
*  Um, I met with a woman who lost her home completely [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3344.66s)]
*  Um, she was in my arms crying [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3348.3399999999997s)]
*  She didn't even know where to begin to ask for assistance [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3350.5s)]
*  And then the home right across the street from her was cut in half by a tornado [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3353.7s)]
*  The one that she was in they had just put up the shutters [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3358.3399999999997s)]
*  They had finished putting the shutters up by 3 30 in the afternoon [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3361.06s)]
*  And a few minutes later the tornado came through their home and and ripped off trees [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3364.18s)]
*  I mean you'll you'll see [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3368.66s)]
*  We'll post some footage on what we we saw because I don't think i've seen anything like this since andrew [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3370.18s)]
*  I wasn't here for andrew but the images that I saw after andrew it's it's exactly like that and it's just [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3375.7s)]
*  Um devastating to see so many families not know where to get help and that's why it's so important to coordinate at the local [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3381.44s)]
*  state and federal level and to have [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3388.58s)]
*  Officials that are going to do that that are willing to work together to provide this immediate assistance for families [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3390.58s)]
*  Yeah, I would ask you about that [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3396.82s)]
*  I mean [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3397.86s)]
*  How has the federal response been so far and the coordination you talked about and have you guys been dealing with the same problems of? [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3398.02s)]
*  Misinformation and disinformation that we're plaguing, you know, north carolina in particular. Well tommy first of all [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3404.24s)]
*  Um, i'm really glad to see that the director of fema was here from the very beginning on the ground [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3410.26s)]
*  Waiting as we were preparing to see what milton was going to bring to the west coast of florida [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3416.02s)]
*  She was here and we had national guard thousands of national guard men already [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3420.98s)]
*  on the ground to assist and so [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3426.34s)]
*  Hopefully and what i'm what i'm encouraging is for the governor's office the state officials to coordinate with [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3429.1200000000003s)]
*  The federal government because i've seen that there have been some some missed opportunities there [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3436.6600000000003s)]
*  But you ask me about misinformation [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3441.2200000000003s)]
*  I have I cannot believe that we have in rick scott a sitting senator who has been on fox news [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3443.5400000000004s)]
*  Spreading disinformation about fema. It's highly irresponsible and it's putting survivors lives at risk [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3451.7s)]
*  Here we have people that have lost everything some people have lost their loved ones to this hurricane [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3459.14s)]
*  And he's on fox news saying that there are not enough funds for disaster relief and yet the man voted against [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3464.3399999999997s)]
*  Funding for fema. I mean it can't get worse than that. There has to be [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3471.14s)]
*  I don't want to I don't want to be this [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3477.9399999999996s)]
*  Crass here tommy, but really there's a special place in hell for people like that [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3480.02s)]
*  I'm, sorry to be so crude, but we are seeing people in pain suffering [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3484.66s)]
*  They've lost their pets. They they've lost their family members [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3489.94s)]
*  They've lost their homes and their businesses then you have rick scott lying to floridians about fema disaster relief and also voting against [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3493.3s)]
*  funding for disaster relief [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3501.54s)]
*  I can't even I can't even fight the words to describe what I feel when I hear him saying that the good thing is that [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3504.1s)]
*  There are a lot of people that are setting the record straight [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3510.02s)]
*  A lot of our local officials whether they're republicans or democrats are [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3513.14s)]
*  Making sure that people understand that that's disinformation [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3516.98s)]
*  But it's just shameful to see a sitting senator here rick scott doing that. Yeah, I mean just to to [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3520.34s)]
*  Put a pin on this point [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3525.94s)]
*  I mean he just recently skipped a vote on a short-term spending bill that included 18 billion dollars for fema [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3526.9s)]
*  He is one of the many republicans who seems to want to continually deny [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3531.62s)]
*  That uh that climate change is man-made and making these storms worse [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3536.9s)]
*  It sounds like republicans are refusing to rush back and put forward an emergency spending bill [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3541.78s)]
*  Before the election to provide any additional relief. Where is rick scott? [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3548.02s)]
*  You know calling for congress to take action sooner or where is he on that? [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3552.6600000000003s)]
*  Well, he did say that there should be [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3556.02s)]
*  More assistance more funding for fema [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3558.7400000000002s)]
*  He did make that call and he wrote a letter of course because he's three weeks [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3560.82s)]
*  Away from an election where he knows that he's extremely vulnerable all of our polling has us [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3564.98s)]
*  Basically tied at this point and so he's trying to do everything to maintain power. I mean [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3570.74s)]
*  Tommy this is a very dangerous individual. He wants to become senate majority leader [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3576.58s)]
*  So just imagine what he would do if he gets back to the senate become senate majority leader and starts dismantling [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3580.74s)]
*  federal agencies like fema [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3587.2999999999997s)]
*  That's part of what project 2025 has included in in those points in that 900 page document [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3589.78s)]
*  It's extremely dangerous and you know, we know that rick scott committed medicare fraud. He the man is a thief tommy [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3595.86s)]
*  I I have to be strong with my language because people need to understand that we have this unique opportunity [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3602.7400000000002s)]
*  to stop someone that has been stealing from the government to get back into the senate because he has [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3609.78s)]
*  Uh very ambitious goals of leading the senate if he becomes senate majority leader [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3616.1800000000003s)]
*  And even if vice president kamala harris becomes the first woman president to lead the nation [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3622.34s)]
*  She won't be able to build on any progress that has already been done [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3626.98s)]
*  If rick scott gets reelected and then become senate majority leader. It's really dangerous. Just imagine [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3630.98s)]
*  Missing mitch mcconnell a senate majority leader. I I just want everyone to have that that view for a minute [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3636.5s)]
*  I'm not kidding. It's scary [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3643.54s)]
*  That that's well said I want to ask you a little bit more about uh rick scott's plans in a second [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3645.8599999999997s)]
*  But just one last question on milton [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3649.8599999999997s)]
*  I've seen estimates that hurricane milton alone could cost between 60 to 100 billion dollars in insured losses [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3651.94s)]
*  That could further increase property insurance prices drive providers out of the state [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3659.46s)]
*  And this just this isn't just a huge problem in florida here in california [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3664.3399999999997s)]
*  I know homeowners have had similar challenges getting insurance because of fires [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3667.8599999999997s)]
*  What do you think the federal government should do to help out people in florida who are going to have to rebuild? [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3671.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and you know the cost of inaction is going to be much greater if we don't [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3677.3s)]
*  Immediately move on having a federally backed program that's going to expand the risk across all states. Like you said [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3682.32s)]
*  The issues of the severe natural disasters are not unique to florida. We're seeing fires in california [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3688.58s)]
*  We're seeing flooding in louisiana, texas other states as well [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3694.42s)]
*  So we have to take some action and just to give you an example today when I visited wellington this family [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3698.1s)]
*  That lost their home [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3704.2599999999998s)]
*  They did not have property insurance because they couldn't find an insurance company that would provide coverage [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3705.62s)]
*  So they are devastated because they don't understand what they're going to do in order to rebuild and that's why fema funding is so [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3712.58s)]
*  Critical and it's so important but also to have a federal program that's going to provide relief [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3719.22s)]
*  But we need to be smart of of how we start rebuilding these communities particularly [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3724.5s)]
*  Along the coast here in the state of florida [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3730.3399999999997s)]
*  We have to make sure that we invest in resiliency something that rick scott also has failed to do [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3732.3399999999997s)]
*  Um, we need to make sure that if if you're living in a very low-lying area that you understand [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3737.7s)]
*  Even if you build a resilient infrastructure it may get damaged when we see another storm like milton [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3743.2999999999997s)]
*  And so we have to have these tough conversations, but you need leaders that are going to have the courage to do that [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3749.38s)]
*  Rick scott has been in government for 14 years [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3755.2200000000003s)]
*  We have a property insurance crisis that began when he was governor here in the state of florida when he gave [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3757.94s)]
*  These sweetheart deals to a lot of insurance companies that came into the market taking away from the public option [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3763.38s)]
*  And here we are paying four times the national average [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3768.9s)]
*  We really need to change the direction of the state in order to be able to provide those opportunities for our families [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3772.1800000000003s)]
*  That are right now just looking at ways to survive in the state of florida back to your point about rick scott trying to be [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3779.38s)]
*  Senate majority leader. I remember [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3786.26s)]
*  Back in 2022 he rolled out this 11-point plan to rescue america [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3788.26s)]
*  It included raising taxes on literally half of the country including some of the most low-income americans [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3792.7400000000002s)]
*  He talked about shutting down the department of education [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3799.7000000000003s)]
*  And the plan also said that all federal laws should automatically sunset after five years [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3802.6600000000003s)]
*  Which it didn't take a genius to point out that it would mean that social security and medicare would be on the chopping block [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3807.78s)]
*  Every five years. Um, I have never seen republicans run away [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3814.7400000000002s)]
*  From their colleague faster, but is rick still pushing his 11-point plan. How's that going on the campaign trail? [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3819.38s)]
*  Oh, he's he's very proud of the 11-point plan [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3825.06s)]
*  But after almost a year of pushback from republicans [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3827.54s)]
*  He said that it would exclude medicare and social security and the truth is that we can't trust rick scott [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3831.3s)]
*  Anything he says it's just to try and and hold on to power [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3836.98s)]
*  I mean he has also been very vocal about repealing the affordable care act and [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3840.02s)]
*  Tommy, you know that here in the state of florida [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3844.9s)]
*  We have some of the largest numbers of people that get their health care through obama care [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3847.1400000000003s)]
*  it's a very popular program here in the state of florida, but he wants to [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3851.2200000000003s)]
*  Completely eliminate that as well and even mitch mcconnell [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3854.98s)]
*  If you remember said that's not the republican plan. That's scott's plan, right? [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3858.34s)]
*  He has he has not changed any of the propositions of raising taxes to middle-class families [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3862.02s)]
*  um even uh [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3868.34s)]
*  You know some republicans have said that that's crazy that they don't understand how he's proposing raising taxes on middle-class families [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3869.94s)]
*  He's on his own and I think that that's one of the things that people don't understand [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3876.58s)]
*  He is the most vulnerable republican running for reelection people in the state of florida don't [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3881.1400000000003s)]
*  They they don't want to vote for rick scott and he doesn't have any allies here within the republican party [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3887.62s)]
*  I can tell you that no one's really helping him in the state of florida. He's on his own [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3892.74s)]
*  So that's why this is a unique opportunity for us to be able to keep the senate majority [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3896.66s)]
*  Finally send rick scott to retirement and bring back some decency into governance here for the state [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3902.82s)]
*  So many floridians deserve that yeah [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3908.9s)]
*  I think there was a lot of reporting at the time that mitch mcconnell really hates rick scott [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3911.06s)]
*  Which is I look the enemy of my enemy, I guess I don't know how to what to make of that, but uh notable [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3916.1s)]
*  Um last week the new york times had progressives like myself kind of breathing into paper bags [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3921.86s)]
*  When they ran a poll that had donald trump running 13 points ahead of kamala harris in florida [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3928.26s)]
*  Are things really that bad? What did you make of that? [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3933.94s)]
*  Tommy that's first of all that was one poll out of like eight polls that we've seen over the past [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3936.66s)]
*  Few weeks that was a complete outlier [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3944.3399999999997s)]
*  And they didn't they didn't do a sample large enough here in the state of florida. The sampling is just not correct [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3947.54s)]
*  It doesn't it's not aligned at all with what i'm seeing on the ground and what i've seen in many other polls [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3954.4199999999996s)]
*  The reality is that harris and trump are probably within four points of each other here in the state [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3960.02s)]
*  And and that's not as that far from what we experienced in 2020 [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3965.22s)]
*  Um, joe biden lost the state of florida by only three points [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3969.7200000000003s)]
*  This is a state where floridians this is a swing state [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3973.6400000000003s)]
*  We always go from one side to the next obama won florida in 2008 and 2012 and then [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3976.84s)]
*  In the last two election cycles. Yes, it veered towards the right, but it's coming right back [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3983.0s)]
*  I've been traveling for almost a year now all over the state of florida [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3987.96s)]
*  independents are voting for democrats [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3992.82s)]
*  Uh republicans many republicans. I just met one today that said I can't stand rick scott [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=3994.98s)]
*  I am voting for you and i'm voting for camila harris that just happened today and it happens to me everywhere I go [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4000.1800000000003s)]
*  Almost in on a daily basis. So donald trump has lost support from many republicans in the state of florida [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4006.42s)]
*  Remember ron de santos ran for president in that primary and there is some sort of [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4012.2400000000002s)]
*  Infighting between those two groups of republicans that are living in florida. He has lost a lot of support [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4018.2400000000002s)]
*  Rick scott is highly highly vulnerable very much disliked. They know his record of overseeing medicare fraud and so [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4024.58s)]
*  No, that i'm telling everyone right now, please don't listen to that poll [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4031.38s)]
*  Don't go by that one outlier poll that makes absolutely no sense [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4036.1800000000003s)]
*  It's a wrong sampling and it doesn't reflect what is going on in the ground come down to florida [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4040.26s)]
*  I'll show you it's incredible the energy that i'm seeing. I haven't seen this in years. All right, that's good pushback [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4046.34s)]
*  We needed to hear that and you're right that um the infighting between [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4051.3s)]
*  De santos and trump certainly hasn't ended and uh that primary [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4054.7400000000002s)]
*  Performance chopped him down a peg or two or a high heel or two [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4058.5600000000004s)]
*  Um, but the other thing that you hear a lot from democrats about florida is that the party registration is changing [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4062.1800000000003s)]
*  There's just basically more republicans moving into the state [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4067.2200000000003s)]
*  How do you think the democratic party can help overcome that deficit because it feels like you know, these can be self-fulfilling prophecies, right? [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4071.2200000000003s)]
*  It's like more republicans move to florida. So democrats [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4077.78s)]
*  Think they have a less of a shot of winning so they stop investing and it's it's a it's a bad cycle [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4081.06s)]
*  So i'm going to start with this for one for one moment [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4086.9s)]
*  I've been thinking a lot about this and i've been always pushing back on this issue because we know that republicans here have purged [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4090.02s)]
*  Voters off the rolls. They don't have a registration advantage because they've been registering more people into their party [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4096.9800000000005s)]
*  No, it's because they've been purging these voters off the rolls and and here's my message to everyone listening to us [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4103.62s)]
*  today in this podcast [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4110.74s)]
*  Republicans have been spreading conspiracy theories and lies for years [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4112.8s)]
*  Why would you believe them now when they're saying that florida is deeply red what happened in 2022? [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4116.9s)]
*  Is that our voters stayed home and that is what the democratic party needs to really work on making sure that we're [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4123.9400000000005s)]
*  Communicating with our voters talking about the issues and making sure that they turn out if they turn out in this election [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4130.8s)]
*  You will see something in florida that no one will expect and and I can't wait to show you [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4137.299999999999s)]
*  That people in the state care about the issues when we talk to them [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4141.94s)]
*  They come out and they vote for us and that is the work of the party [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4145.78s)]
*  My job is just making sure that people know that in the senate race [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4149.86s)]
*  Um, they have an option of voting for someone that's going to put [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4153.62s)]
*  Their priorities and their families above politics and above everything else and we haven't had that representation in the u.s [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4156.82s)]
*  Senate and we sorely need that and I think that that's why also when you talk to floridians [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4163.78s)]
*  They're done with rick scott and they're ready to support me in the senate race [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4169.139999999999s)]
*  The other big thing on the ballot this year that is different is amendment four [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4172.34s)]
*  Um, can you tell listeners what that is and how you think it might impact turnout this year? [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4178.099999999999s)]
*  You know now we're living under one of the most extreme bans on abortion [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4183.7s)]
*  We as of may 1st women in the state of florida are facing a six-week [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4187.94s)]
*  Abortion ban with hardly any exceptions to rape and incest and it's a ban that rick scott said that he would support that [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4192.74s)]
*  He would have signed into law if he was governor [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4198.34s)]
*  The good news is that we do have an opportunity to protect a woman's right to choose [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4201.0599999999995s)]
*  Free of government interference if we vote to pass amendment four [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4205.62s)]
*  We gathered all the signatures even before the deadline and those signatures included a good portion of republican registered voters [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4209.86s)]
*  And independents as well [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4217.46s)]
*  And so this is not a partisan issue for us in the state and everything that i'm seeing is that we will be able to [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4218.900000000001s)]
*  Get that 60 threshold and just remember I only need 50 plus one [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4224.1s)]
*  But this is a decision that as you all know needs to be made between a woman her doctor her family her faith [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4228.26s)]
*  Without politicians like rick scott telling a woman what they can do with their own bodies [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4235.9400000000005s)]
*  We understand that here in the state of florida. They've gone way too far to the right [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4241.46s)]
*  too extreme attacking our [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4247.0599999999995s)]
*  Fundamental freedoms and our civil rights because this is not only central to our freedom for a woman [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4249.28s)]
*  It's central to our health care [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4254.34s)]
*  It's also central to our dignity and many men in florida understand that I have i've had many conversations [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4255.86s)]
*  With older men that for them. This is a top issue [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4263.38s)]
*  um, I I [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4266.34s)]
*  Met this older gentleman who had lost his aunt before roe v wade and for him [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4267.62s)]
*  The abortion issue is the reason why he's coming out voting for amendment four and also voting for democrats up and down the ballot because [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4272.42s)]
*  It won't mean anything right if we pass amendment four [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4279.780000000001s)]
*  Rick scott gets reelected and then he pushes for a national abortion ban. That's part of their strategy [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4282.900000000001s)]
*  They will be doing that and they will be also [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4288.34s)]
*  Pursuing following, you know criminal lawsuits against doctors and health care providers that that would provide this critical health care [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4291.700000000001s)]
*  So this is a dangerous time for this country [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4298.58s)]
*  But I really do feel tommy very optimistic of what i'm seeing because i've seen people fighting like I haven't seen before and this [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4301.78s)]
*  this [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4310.02s)]
*  organizing mobilizing for amendment four to protect education to protect teachers because as you as you know [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4311.04s)]
*  Rick scott has also been attacking teachers calling them socialists here in the state of florida [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4317.62s)]
*  Um, we've been doing that for quite some time because they just crossed the line [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4322.34s)]
*  They've gone so extreme that florida has had it and that's what gives me so much hope and optimism for november [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4325.78s)]
*  You know rick scott seems to call everybody. He doesn't like a socialist. There's a lot of people [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4332.0199999999995s)]
*  In florida who have left socialist countries who have seen actual socialism [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4337.38s)]
*  totalitarian versions in some cases not like the democratic socialist of america right like the bernie sanders version like [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4342.88s)]
*  You know countries that are authoritarian [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4348.9s)]
*  do those [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4351.46s)]
*  Constant charges from people like rick scott. Do they work to scare people or do voters who have actually experienced? [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4352.82s)]
*  the socialism brush them off so those attacks really [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4360.66s)]
*  Dig into the trauma that so many families like mine feel when you hear that word because in latin america [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4365.219999999999s)]
*  socialist dictatorships have really destroyed the political the social the economic institutions of these countries and we have [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4372.16s)]
*  Socialistic dictatorships right now in venezuela in cuba maduro who stole the election by the way, right? [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4379.7s)]
*  And he's destroyed that country. That's why you've seen millions of venezuelans flee [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4385.62s)]
*  That country and so they use that fear to confuse a lot of our communities down here who have [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4390.02s)]
*  Maybe moved to the united states from these countries and they've only been living here for 10 15 20 years [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4396.1s)]
*  So it's it's a tactic that has worked [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4402.5s)]
*  But I think that people now realize that they're using it to confuse our communities and they're pushing back [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4404.82s)]
*  When rick scott calls me [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4410.66s)]
*  And names me with these false attacks [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4412.9s)]
*  I can tell you that it's also an insult to the legacy of my mom [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4415.38s)]
*  Who lived under a military dictatorship who brought us here from our home country of ecuador to give us freedom to give us opportunities [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4419.46s)]
*  And so many latinos that have come here to work. Uh, so it's it's really shameful that he's doing that [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4427.219999999999s)]
*  I think it is falling on deaf ears, though [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4433.219999999999s)]
*  I think that by now people are realizing that they have nothing else to attack us on they're trying to distract because rick scott [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4435.86s)]
*  The reality is he doesn't want people to know that he stole from the government that he's a thief that he's the wealthiest senator [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4442.58s)]
*  In washington dc and wants to take away medicare social security push a national abortion ban and eliminate obama care [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w98wzMOrGo&t=4448.099999999999s)]
