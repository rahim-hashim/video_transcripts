Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# EXCLUSIVE: Top Harris Campaign Staff Tell Us What Went Wrong In 2024 Election
**Pod Save America:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs)
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Dan Pfeiffer. We have a special show for you today [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=0.0s)]
*  I am here in Washington DC where I'm about to sit down with the leadership of the Harris Walls campaign for their first interview [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3.6s)]
*  About what happened in the election last week Michael Tyler who's the communications director for the campaign called me and said that [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=11.28s)]
*  They were ready to speak and that we they wanted to have that conversation on Pod Save America [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=16.88s)]
*  This is the first time that any of them have done an interview since the election. They don't pretend to have all the answers here [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=21.68s)]
*  There's way more to cover than we could possibly cover in one podcast [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=26.84s)]
*  this is the beginning of a conversation about [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=30.0s)]
*  understanding what happened in 2024 and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=33.04s)]
*  Learning the lessons that Democrats are going to need going forward [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  Joining me here in the studio in Washington [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=38.88s)]
*  We're Jenna Malley-Dillon who ran the Harris Walls campaign Quentin Foulkes who is the deputy campaign manager and oversaw paid advertising [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=40.76s)]
*  Stephanie Cutter who oversaw messaging and communications and joining by zoom was David Ploth who consulted on all of it [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=47.36s)]
*  Thank you for doing this [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=53.44s)]
*  Very much appreciate you having this conversation with us here on Pod Save America [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=55.44s)]
*  Just a level set Jenna, I'll start with you [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=59.72s)]
*  How did you feel going into Election Day and at what point did you have a sense that things were beginning to break? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=61.76s)]
*  Trump's way was there a county results something about the turnout like was there a moment when you sort of understood that how it was gonna end [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=66.92s)]
*  well [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=74.56s)]
*  The truth is that we really thought this was a very close race [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=75.68s)]
*  We talked about the entire time we saw it as a margin of error race almost the entire time [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=79.8s)]
*  The vice president was in the race and we knew we had to have strong turnout on Election Day. We saw early vote [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=84.92s)]
*  really ending strong for us and saw [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=92.19999999999999s)]
*  You know the types of voters we wanted to see turnout, but you know, we expected this to be close [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=96.11999999999999s)]
*  We also expected that Florida was gonna come in a bit redder [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=102.32s)]
*  Virginia we knew was tracking to being you know that we were gonna be ahead [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=106.67999999999999s)]
*  But that we would be ahead by less than we were in 2020 [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  So we were expecting to see that when we saw that we also did anticipate [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=114.12s)]
*  That the night would go relatively long because some of these states would take longer to come in [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  But I think it was you know, really after polls closed. There was nothing that we saw throughout the day [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=124.2s)]
*  There was nothing that we saw that told us there was overwhelming turnout or anything out of complete expectations on [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=128.42000000000002s)]
*  Trump's side, but it really took us into the hours of [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=135.8s)]
*  You know polls closing for us to know for sure that [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=139.95999999999998s)]
*  Things were not tightening they were tight, but they weren't tightening in the direction [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=143.39999999999998s)]
*  We needed them to be and is that just because Trump's turnout was so high [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=147.2s)]
*  Well, honestly, I think I think it's a little bit mixed. I mean we saw certainly Trump turnout high in [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=151.07999999999998s)]
*  Early vote we really believe that to be mode shifting and that's what I think it was [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=159.04s)]
*  I think we also saw [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=163.56s)]
*  Turnout was as expected in rural areas like we didn't see anything that said, you know [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=165.44s)]
*  Like maybe we saw in 16 or even in 20 that he had more turnout than we we had anticipated and our analytics [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=169.98000000000002s)]
*  Really was quite close much closer than it had been in 20 and in in 16 [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=177.28s)]
*  But I do think we saw some lighter turnout in some of the areas we had hoped but difference of a point here or there [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=181.8s)]
*  Which obviously in a close race makes a huge difference [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=187.74s)]
*  And then I think we saw a little bit of a drop in support in a few areas for us [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  So that ultimately I think is is why we weren't able to close the gap [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=195.12s)]
*  It wasn't so much that what we were seeing the battlegrounds was out of expectation or that he had some hidden turnout [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=200.16s)]
*  We hadn't picked up on David when you say it was a margin of error race. You need a high turnout [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=205.4s)]
*  What did your polls tell you where the race was heading into Election Day? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=210.96s)]
*  Well, then you and I talked prior to the election and just to rewind I think when Kamala Harris became the nominee [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  She was behind we kind of you know climbed back [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=221.4s)]
*  And even post debate, you know, we still had ourselves down [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=226.0s)]
*  You know in the battleground states but very close and so I think by the end it was a jump all race [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=230.24s)]
*  And I think we needed some things to break our way [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=236.0s)]
*  Maybe Trump's Election Day turnout would underperform our Election Day turnout would you know either be at level or over perform and [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=238.0s)]
*  You know, we'd win more the people who decided in the last three or four days [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=246.18s)]
*  I think our data and the New York Times date and other public data suggested [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=249.52s)]
*  We did have some progress with undecideds at late October. So it was a dead he race, but you know at the end of the day [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=253.67999999999998s)]
*  You know, the political atmosphere was pretty brutal and that's not an excuse you had right track wrong track [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=261.3s)]
*  I think 28 72 about 70% of the country saying they were angry [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=266.32s)]
*  And dissatisfied you had Trump's approval rating on his first term [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=271.32s)]
*  frustratingly high 48 to 51 depending on the state [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=275.8s)]
*  Obviously the incumbent president's approval rating around 38 to 41 depending on the state [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=279.24s)]
*  And you know, I think the economy and inflation still driving a lot of votes [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=284.44000000000005s)]
*  So I think given that we had a challenging political environment the fact that we got the race to dead heat [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=290.04s)]
*  Was positive but boy it was slow moving and I think we were focused on seven states [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=297.76000000000005s)]
*  You know, that's our windshield into the world the battleground states [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=304.76000000000005s)]
*  But you know what we saw on Election Day was, you know, New Jersey and California and Connecticut and New York [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=308.36s)]
*  Massive shifts. So I think where Kamala Harris campaigned we were able to keep the tide down a little bit [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=316.96000000000004s)]
*  But it ended up being a pretty strong [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=322.68s)]
*  You know tailwind for Donald Trump and I think it's worth reminding everybody [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=325.44s)]
*  We saw in 22, even though that was a pretty decent Democratic year. We saw these shifts [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=331.0s)]
*  We saw them in 20 we saw them in 16 [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=336.24s)]
*  You know Trump [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=339.06s)]
*  specifically, but Republicans generally [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=340.96000000000004s)]
*  Improving their vote share amongst non college voters particularly non college voters of color [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=343.40000000000003s)]
*  And this was a surprising race because Kamala Harris actually did I think better with senior voters than I think a lot of people would have thought [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=348.32s)]
*  So margin of error race where we inherited a deficit we got it to even but the thing never moved [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=355.0s)]
*  So to Jen's point, I think we were you know, we were hopeful [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=361.68s)]
*  I don't know how optimistic we were but we thought okay, this is tied and if a couple things break our way and listen [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=365.04s)]
*  I'm naive in this way. I just thought at the end of the day particularly because Trump did not close [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=371.4s)]
*  Well, I thought and I thought Kamala Harris closed [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=375.1s)]
*  Well, Trump was reminding people some of the things they don't like about him that that might give us what we needed [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=377.56s)]
*  But at the end of the day, I think the political atmosphere the desire for change all those fundamentals that you've spent a lot of time talking [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=383.9s)]
*  Really presented huge challenges for us [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=390.88s)]
*  So, you know we got we got there but we didn't get the breaks we needed on Election Day [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=393.32s)]
*  How deep was the hole that she had to climb out of well Jen? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=398.4s)]
*  I mean, I think listen there was the Biden Trump 1.0 [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=401.88s)]
*  Which is obviously pretty catastrophic in terms of where the race stood when we got in [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=404.76s)]
*  My recollection is some of that snapback, but you know, we were behind [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=409.0s)]
*  I mean, I think it surprised people because there was these public polls that came out in late September early October [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=412.2s)]
*  Showing us with leads that we never saw, you know [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=419.2s)]
*  I mean it was just basically a race that in the battlegrounds was [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=421.88s)]
*  46 47 47 48 so that's not where we started we started behind [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=425.28s)]
*  She was able to climb out. I think even after the debate we might have gained what point five one [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=430.44s)]
*  It wasn't a race that moved a lot. And so I think when you think about our own internal analytics [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=435.79999999999995s)]
*  You know if you have it, Wisconsin at 47 47 [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=441.91999999999996s)]
*  Or Pennsylvania 48 47 Trump, let's say which I think is where we had it at the end [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=446.02s)]
*  You know [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=451.18s)]
*  You've got to have undecided break your way more than your opponents and you've got to get a little [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=451.82s)]
*  benefit from turnout which we weren't able to do obviously the defining event of this race was the candidate switch and [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=456.46s)]
*  Everything every decision you guys had to make everything you had to do was defined also by the compressed calendar in which you were operating [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=463.5s)]
*  And Quentin you were there when that's what happened [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=469.9s)]
*  how [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=472.94s)]
*  Were you able there was a one-month period between the debate and when president actually dropped out? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=474.18s)]
*  Obviously it seemed like a dropping out could be a possibility [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=479.54s)]
*  We were able to do any thinking in or planning in that one month period about [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=482.18s)]
*  What a race with the vice president looked like or did you have to sort of start cold on that first day the moment? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=486.74s)]
*  This through you know, you got the call or the statement went out. I mean we started cold [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=492.74s)]
*  We there was no planning involved in any other candidates [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=497.74s)]
*  I mean we were honestly in crisis management mode of keeping President Biden in the race, you know convincing [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=500.5s)]
*  You know Democratic allies [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=507.5s)]
*  That he could still do this and one of the things was trying to keep the president out on the road as much [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=509.65999999999997s)]
*  We were still doing everything we could from a campaign and he made the decision that [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=514.5799999999999s)]
*  He did not want to continue on [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=518.3199999999999s)]
*  And he pulled some of the senior leadership together and said that he was going to be with the vice president [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=520.66s)]
*  It also wasn't anything that our team took for granted to just say okay, she is the nominee [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=526.3s)]
*  We knew that there was still a situation where we had to sure up [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=531.5s)]
*  Delegates and that's where we started from and then after that point that is when we begin to say, okay [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=534.74s)]
*  How can we define her? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=539.9399999999999s)]
*  Also Trump's favorabilities numbers were creeping up as pluff said and we had to do something about that as well [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=541.98s)]
*  And so there's a lot of walking and chewing gum at the same time [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=546.66s)]
*  But there really was no sort of contingency planning to turn the race over to her right after that debate or at any point [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=549.14s)]
*  Until President Biden definitively said he wasn't going to continue on [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=555.3s)]
*  Stephanie I think what probably surprised a lot of people in politics was the vice president was a largely unknown [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=559.38s)]
*  Quantity to much of the electorate [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=563.46s)]
*  So you guys had under a very short time frame had to do two things as quince said you had to teach people about her [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=565.02s)]
*  And also make a case against Donald Trump who would just come off [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=570.1s)]
*  He was at an all-time high come off the assassination attempt the debate against the president in terms of messaging [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=572.68s)]
*  How did you think about the balance between the two? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=579.22s)]
*  Well, the first thing we had to do is put on a convention and we had about three weeks to flip [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=582.1800000000001s)]
*  a convention that was being built around Joe Biden, so [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=588.7s)]
*  We were able to flip it, you know to fit [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=592.98s)]
*  this very new character of a different generation different experience different background [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=596.46s)]
*  and [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=603.34s)]
*  Looking at the data at the time which [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=605.34s)]
*  Jen and pluff and quentin have all talked about there was she had a huge deficit in favorability [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=607.7s)]
*  Because either people didn't know about her or what they did know about her was based off of negative media [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=613.7800000000001s)]
*  So our first priority was to define her in that convention [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=619.5s)]
*  Fill in her bio as part of that [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=624.38s)]
*  You know [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=626.7800000000001s)]
*  We already knew how to do the negative on Trump and we knew that there was a lot of Trump Nesha out there people didn't [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=627.3000000000001s)]
*  remember the [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=632.98s)]
*  four years of the Trump [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=634.58s)]
*  Administration that badly because they had been through hell [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=636.6600000000001s)]
*  They had been through [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=640.1800000000001s)]
*  coven [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=642.34s)]
*  Both under his watch and under President Biden's [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=643.74s)]
*  I'm putting aside a lot of the details of who's at fault and what Biden did to dig us out and all of that [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=646.9000000000001s)]
*  And then they had a deal with inflation. So they had been through hell. So looking back, you know, you remember [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=653.26s)]
*  a previous time much more fondly [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=659.94s)]
*  Because you've now think that you've gone through the worst [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=663.1s)]
*  So we had to remind people what life was like [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=666.86s)]
*  That was our second imperative and then the third imperative as part of the convention and leading into the remaining days of the campaign is [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=669.18s)]
*  What's that choice? What are the compare? What are the two very different visions between Trump and Kamala Harris? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=677.5799999999999s)]
*  So the convention, you know, it demonstrated a lot of enthusiasm for Kamala Harris a lot of freshness [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=684.22s)]
*  future-oriented [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=692.9s)]
*  Bringing a variety of coalitions together. We had independents Republicans Democrats [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=695.9399999999999s)]
*  business leaders sports figures everybody coming together around a new way forward and finally turning the page [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=701.74s)]
*  so [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=709.5799999999999s)]
*  You know through the rest of that campaign through the our next thing was the debate just a few weeks later [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=710.62s)]
*  And it was boom boom boom all the way through probably early October after the walls debate [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=716.14s)]
*  That we had to move through these things so quickly [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=721.02s)]
*  Once we got through all of that then the race started to gel and [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=723.5s)]
*  You know [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=728.9399999999999s)]
*  To the extent people were open to remembering what Trump what life was like under Trump [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=730.34s)]
*  We were trying to fill that in to the extent people had questions about Kamala Harris [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=735.42s)]
*  We were still trying to fill that in so in a hundred and seven days [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=739.84s)]
*  You know what typically takes us a year and a half two years in a presidential campaign [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=743.06s)]
*  We were defining someone who was wholly undefined from the start trying to remind people about [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=747.7s)]
*  The opponent and what life was like underneath him and also take into account what the political [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=753.62s)]
*  Environment was and the realities that we had to deal with [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=759.5s)]
*  Which you know, she was the incumbent which what she really wasn't the incumbent people didn't know that much about her [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=763.1s)]
*  The economy was still [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=769.74s)]
*  Slightly getting better, but we couldn't really take care take credit for it [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=772.26s)]
*  So we were in a bit of a crossroads trying to figure out what that October [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=776.8s)]
*  Messaging and closing messaging would look like pluff [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=780.72s)]
*  there is a sort of a debate outside of your campaign that [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=783.44s)]
*  The primary and most important thing to do was to educate voters about Kamala Harris and that voters who are new all they needed [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=787.4s)]
*  To know about Trump [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=793.96s)]
*  I take it you guys disagreed with that analysis and you felt a need to at least knock his numbers down a little bit [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=794.6800000000001s)]
*  Is that right? Of course. I mean that is nonsense. So first of all [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=799.84s)]
*  Back to where the question you were talking to Stephanie about [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=804.8s)]
*  Kamala Harris started this race if I recall with favorable 33 to 35. She ended it at 48 [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=808.68s)]
*  She actually ended the election with a higher approval rating than Donald Trump [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=814.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure someone's won the presidency with a lower approval rating. So I think as people got to know her they liked her [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=817.6s)]
*  I think her approval rating now post-election is north of 50. That was really hard work and I will say that [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=824.8399999999999s)]
*  That [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=830.48s)]
*  You know think about if if Kamala Harris had come out of a process that was traditional [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=832.64s)]
*  Running in and winning a primary so maybe become the nominee March or April, you know [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=837.84s)]
*  You spend a month six weeks on your biography. You keep coming back to it [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=842.16s)]
*  You define the Trump first term you raise the stakes of what a Trump second term would be like [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=846.36s)]
*  You have like a month just to run paid advertising on things like housing and your tax cut [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=851.14s)]
*  So this is where there was a price to be paid for the short campaign [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=856.16s)]
*  And you can't even say a hundred seven days because to Quentin's point some of that was spent shoring up the Democratic nomination [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=860.48s)]
*  Then you really have to have said everything you want to say by the time people start voting early [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=866.48s)]
*  So we had a little more than two months to do bio [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=870.96s)]
*  Contrast on the economy on health care raising the stakes of Trump. So yes when you have a race where you've got the current [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=874.76s)]
*  Incumbent president with approval ratings of let's say 38 to 40 [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=883.08s)]
*  Never in history we had this before at least since I guess Grover Cleveland [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=887.42s)]
*  so once you have a former president running where 48 to 51 percent of the people approve of his first term and [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=890.9799999999999s)]
*  People are dissatisfied with the direction of the country [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=898.3399999999999s)]
*  You have to raise the stakes of what a second term would be like [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=901.02s)]
*  So I think for us we spent much more time trying to raise the stakes of a second term than [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=905.3399999999999s)]
*  Rearbitrating the first because voters just weren't open to that [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=910.02s)]
*  So that's why pointing out, you know his tariff and what that would mean in terms of a huge sales tax for the American people [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=913.22s)]
*  The fact that he's more unhinged he wants unchecked power project 2025 ended up being about as popular as the Ebola virus [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=919.38s)]
*  So we did a lot of good work there [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=926.74s)]
*  And now of course the son of a bitch lied about it and he's hiring everybody who authored it project [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=928.46s)]
*  2025 is going to be the Trump administration agenda as we pointed out so we had to do that [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=933.7s)]
*  So if we had just run a race solely on [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=939.3000000000001s)]
*  Kamala Harris positives though. We did a lot of that on what Kamala Harris wants to do on the economy [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=942.5s)]
*  We did a lot of that. It's worth reminding your listeners who live in California or New York or Alabama or Florida [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=947.74s)]
*  You're not experiencing the presidential race as its experience in Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=953.78s)]
*  We spent a lot of time. She spent a lot of time driving a core economic message [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=959.66s)]
*  But in our view that was not enough when you've got someone whose first term was judged [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=964.58s)]
*  Favorably enough by enough people to give him the election and people are dissatisfied about where you are now and you're part of that administration [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=969.78s)]
*  You have to basically raise the stakes and for us it was on the economy [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=976.26s)]
*  It was on the fact that all the people who stood in his way last time were warning us about him [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=981.8599999999999s)]
*  It was about project 2025 [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=986.64s)]
*  It was about abortion and you know, I think we did a good job of that based on our data [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=988.7399999999999s)]
*  But we had to stay on that. So I I think that data is an incredibly [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=994.2199999999999s)]
*  Faulty reading that what we should have done is just lift up Kamala Harris [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=998.5799999999999s)]
*  We clearly did her favorability rating increased by I believe 15 points [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1002.38s)]
*  If you look at who do you trust more to look out for people like your family? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1006.98s)]
*  Who do you think is gonna fight for the middle class? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1010.8199999999999s)]
*  Huge progress for Kamala Harris even on crime and immigration. We were able to make double-digit progress [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1013.34s)]
*  So we were very focused on lifting her up but to win a race like this given the political [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1018.34s)]
*  Atmospherics which were quite challenging we had to raise the risk of a Trump second term [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1024.34s)]
*  Jen you guys are obviously operating in a very very tough political environment [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1028.74s)]
*  incumbent president [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1032.98s)]
*  Very low approval ratings. Let's puff mentioned wrong track right track approving the economy all [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1034.98s)]
*  very challenging the also in the least the public polling huge desire for change right frustration the status quo not just that's here the [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1040.14s)]
*  United States, but we've seen that across the world since kovat [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1047.94s)]
*  A [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1050.42s)]
*  Challenging place to be if you were the vice president to the unpopular [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1051.62s)]
*  Incumbent president felt like much of the convention as Stephanie mentioned was trying to make her a change candidate talk about turning the page [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1055.34s)]
*  So can you talk a little about how you tried to do that and whether you think [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1062.58s)]
*  She could or should have done more to distance herself from President Biden something [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1066.62s)]
*  I think as evidenced by the answer on the view she was at least personally uncomfortable with well [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1070.42s)]
*  Yeah, I mean look first of all I [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1074.46s)]
*  Think people when they vote for president want to vote about the future and [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1077.26s)]
*  They saw in the vice president someone they didn't know someone they didn't know a lot about a background [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1081.14s)]
*  So you know who she was what she stood for what she did as vice president? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1086.8600000000001s)]
*  So in every step of what we were trying to do we had to tell a pretty robust story in in one ad or one [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1091.02s)]
*  Policy rollout or one event that you don't often have to do because of the time we were in [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1098.82s)]
*  But I do think that we really focused from the get-go on how she was [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1102.94s)]
*  different than everyone else different than Joe Biden different than Donald Trump and at the end of the day the choice was her versus [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1109.38s)]
*  Donald Trump and at the same time [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1115.1000000000001s)]
*  You know she was very clear that she was a new generation of leadership, but it wasn't just like a statement [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1117.14s)]
*  It was here's what I need to focus on her first policy announcements were economic [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1123.14s)]
*  Talking about housing talking about lowering costs understanding that people [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1129.9s)]
*  Really didn't feel like things were progressing in the way that they wanted to all of the right track wrong track data [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1134.22s)]
*  But how she brought her own point of view to thinking about housing sandwich generation [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1140.54s)]
*  That was probably her biggest applause line one of the best testing things that we did that wasn't a poll tested [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1146.1s)]
*  Let's let's you know work on this poll this [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1151.38s)]
*  This data to tell us this is the right issue [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1154.58s)]
*  That was about her life and also understanding what people in the country were really needing [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1157.5400000000002s)]
*  So I think that in a hundred seven day race [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1162.44s)]
*  It is very difficult to do all the things you would normally do in a year and a half two years [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1165.66s)]
*  But I think wherever we had an opportunity the vice president did put her own stamp on this and [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1170.3400000000001s)]
*  Did it in a deeper way then I think probably we got the kind of full breadth of coverage on it of course [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1176.66s)]
*  You know when you have a administration that a lot of progress has been made and you're part of that progress [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1182.82s)]
*  It's complicated when you're asked questions in certain ways, but at the end of the day [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1189.1399999999999s)]
*  I think she really every time she turned [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1192.74s)]
*  You know talk to a voter every time she was out on the stump. She really leaned into her own [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1196.06s)]
*  Vision, but the headwinds were tough. I will also though add of course we lost [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1201.22s)]
*  So I'm not here to say that that didn't happen [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1206.8799999999999s)]
*  We would rather not have that happen, but where she campaigned [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1209.0400000000002s)]
*  We did way better than the rest of the country and Donald Trump did worse to the point that you were just talking about with [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1214.48s)]
*  Pluff that idea that people have just a well constructed already baked in idea about Trump [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1219.8600000000001s)]
*  And they don't need to learn anymore. It's just complete fallacy [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1226.88s)]
*  I mean his numbers are stronger today than they have ever been yeah, and that was critical for us [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1230.2600000000002s)]
*  And we also believe this race was not just about Kamala Harris [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1235.1399999999999s)]
*  It was Kamala Harris versus Donald Trump [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1238.68s)]
*  and we had to set that choice in that frame up and I think that we were able to [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1240.78s)]
*  Anywhere we campaign in all seven of these states where Donald Trump by the way campaign to he did worse and we did better and we [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1245.42s)]
*  Did make real progress against these national headwinds if in every other state, but the battlegrounds [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1252.4s)]
*  There was a negative eight point shift to the right and the battlegrounds [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1257.58s)]
*  So we needed it to be better than that and perhaps if we had more time we could have done that but I think that's [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1262.22s)]
*  fundamental that when people [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1267.82s)]
*  Learned more about her understood what she stood for where she came from and what her vision was [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1269.98s)]
*  they responded well to that and they responded in a favorable way, especially in contrast to [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1275.7s)]
*  You know a point of view that Donald Trump will be worse, and I think that's playing out right now [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1281.34s)]
*  Dan on the the Biden question we of course got that [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1285.66s)]
*  Everywhere we went and [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1289.84s)]
*  We knew what the data was we knew we had to show her as her own person and point to the future and not try [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1292.08s)]
*  to rehash the past [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1298.78s)]
*  But she also felt that she was part of the administration and unless we said something like well [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1301.0s)]
*  I would have handled the border completely differently. We were never gonna satisfy anybody [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1308.0s)]
*  So we did talk about things like she's a different generation [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1312.6799999999998s)]
*  Most of her career is from outside of Washington not inside Washington [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1316.76s)]
*  So she knows a lot of the best ideas are from across the country [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1320.4399999999998s)]
*  Her career has been about reaching across the aisle finding common-sense ways to get things done [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1325.0s)]
*  It's not been based in ideological politics all of these things [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1330.32s)]
*  We were trying to tell a story and give the impression that she was different [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1334.6s)]
*  Without pointing to a specific issue [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1339.8s)]
*  Can I ask this why not a specific issue is it some she was unwilling to do your it see you've worried even feel [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1342.16s)]
*  disingenuous or because [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1348.0s)]
*  She felt like she was part of the administration [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1350.2s)]
*  So why should she look back and pick out cherry pick some things that she would have done differently when she was part of it [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1352.3s)]
*  And she also she had tremendous loyalty to President Biden [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1358.16s)]
*  And you know if we had said [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1362.64s)]
*  Just imagine this you I mean you've been on plenty of campaigns [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1365.76s)]
*  Imagine if we said well we would have taken this approach on the border imagine the round of stories [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1369.1599999999999s)]
*  Coming out after that of people saying well [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1375.9599999999998s)]
*  She never said that in the meeting or what meeting when she said this or I remember when she did that and it was just [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1378.28s)]
*  It wasn't gonna give us what we needed [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1384.8s)]
*  Because it wouldn't be a clean break. It would be you know days upon days in a limited time window that we had [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1387.72s)]
*  Of dealing of who what when where so the best we could do and the most that she felt comfortable with was saying like look [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1395.0s)]
*  vice presidents never break with their presidents the only time in recent memories when [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1403.0800000000002s)]
*  Pence broke with Trump after [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1408.76s)]
*  Trump stormed the Capitol [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1412.4s)]
*  So they call that the murder exemption [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1414.72s)]
*  If the president tries to murder you can break yes [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1418.24s)]
*  If you are you know ripping up the Constitution trying to overturn an election people die [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1421.22s)]
*  Then you could break with your president, but absent that [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1426.42s)]
*  vice presidents stick by their presidents and she wasn't willing to [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1430.22s)]
*  You know change that precedent for whoever the future president vice presidential partnership would be because it would mean a whole you know [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1435.2600000000002s)]
*  different set of [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1443.46s)]
*  Problems as if we don't have enough problems in our democracy right now [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1445.66s)]
*  So unless we were willing to say, you know [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1449.6200000000001s)]
*  Biden said green and she said blue on any particular issue where we're never really gonna satisfy that [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1454.1s)]
*  So our focus was let's look to the future. Let's describe her and her approach the things. Let's use policies [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1459.58s)]
*  future looking policies to demonstrate that [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1465.9s)]
*  Difference but in the end, you know, we've all seen the data. It's the too many people thought that you'd be a continuation [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1468.94s)]
*  Which on the economy was you know the incumbent killer [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1475.98s)]
*  Quit and the post-election analysis [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1480.38s)]
*  There's been a ton of focus on the very ubiquitous trans ad that Trump campaign spent tens of millions of dollars on [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1482.38s)]
*  there have been sort of two strains of all this one the sense that [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1487.8600000000001s)]
*  Her position and the Democratic Party position on trans related issues are his were one of the reasons why? [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1492.7s)]
*  We lost but also real questions about why the campaign decided [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1499.14s)]
*  Not to respond to the ad specifically my understanding from reporting at least is that you guys [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1503.6399999999999s)]
*  Tested a bunch of responses and it didn't and they didn't work [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1508.36s)]
*  Just tell me your thinking there and what role you think that ad and those issues actually played in the race [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1511.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think you know, it's important to put everything into context. We've we've you know, very well established the time frame [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1515.56s)]
*  And it's honestly a lot shorter than a hundred and seven days, but we had three core objectives to the paid media [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1523.36s)]
*  It was to define the vice president it was to defend her on incoming attacks and a lot of these attacks have been baked in [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1528.56s)]
*  For the past three and a half years while she was the vice president. They were attacking her [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1535.92s)]
*  You know, she was at negative 20 something on immigration [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1540.72s)]
*  We got that down to negative 10 Trump had a positive 22 point advantage on the economy. We got that down to 7 [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1544.52s)]
*  and we had to respond to those things and [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1551.56s)]
*  When you sort of looked at the core issues aside from the attacks like trans issues are just at the bottom for voters the economy [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1553.92s)]
*  Inflation crime immigration are the top issues [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1562.0400000000002s)]
*  They were also some of the issues that she was getting attacked on [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1565.6000000000001s)]
*  Into the element of sort of defining her and doing it in a way that sort of fit within what you're trying to do [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1568.76s)]
*  There's a direct approach that you can take to anything and then there is an approach that you can take that accomplishes [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1573.8400000000001s)]
*  Two of the three objectives a lot of the stuff that we did [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1578.8400000000001s)]
*  Such as talking about her prosecutorial background and then saying that she went after transnational gangs cartels [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1582.76s)]
*  It was to push back [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1589.0800000000002s)]
*  Suitably on the immigration attacks that were coming at her as well as credentialing her her background on things that were absent [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1591.32s)]
*  And stand-alone of the Biden administration [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1598.8s)]
*  We did a lot of stuff about her record as AG her record as a prosecutor [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1601.1200000000001s)]
*  Not as vice president because it also allowed her to stand alone separate from the Biden administration [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1604.92s)]
*  On the trans attack one [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1610.0800000000002s)]
*  Obviously it was a very effective ad at the end. I ultimately don't believe that it was about the issue of trans [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1612.76s)]
*  I think that it made her seem out of touch [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1618.68s)]
*  And it was sort of a pseudo economic ad underneath it because he was saying you're gonna pay for it with taxpayer money [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1621.76s)]
*  And it was in her own words and that's something but we tested a ton of responses to this direct responses [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1628.0s)]
*  And none of them ever tested as well as basically her [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1634.92s)]
*  You know talking about what she would do to Jen's point the future the type of president that she would be [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1639.08s)]
*  There were elements of it where we did try to say you know [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1644.4799999999998s)]
*  And we put ads on television of her saying you've seen all the negative attacks against me and try to bottle it up because I also [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1648.04s)]
*  Think you have to think about the entire sentiment when you're running a paid campaign and the trans ad [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1653.6s)]
*  I think because of the content a lot of people felt like it was much bigger than what it was but to put that into [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1658.04s)]
*  Team red meaning Trump and all the super PACs that were spending on Trump's behalf [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1664.04s)]
*  That was 7% of their total ads was on that issue was that specific that that was two ads right? [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1668.16s)]
*  There was the original then there was almost Charlemagne, and it was all Trump so Trump spent [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1674.0800000000002s)]
*  You know 37% of his you know 200 million on that ad but Trump wasn't the only spender [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1678.44s)]
*  We were getting hit across the board and so you have to take into account what all the super PACs are doing and play [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1684.6000000000001s)]
*  That and I think that's what Trump was doing his super PACs were hitting us on the economy [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1689.96s)]
*  Immigration and crime and Trump even started hitting us on immigration [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1694.72s)]
*  And I think the veracity of which we came out of the gate and responded to that [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1697.64s)]
*  They weren't expecting that from us and then they backed off of that and at that point they started going into it [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1701.6000000000001s)]
*  And so it is easy to say with the kind of resources that we raised we should have been able to do everything [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1706.24s)]
*  But that's not the case you have to make decisions in the time frame that we were in in this race [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1711.2800000000002s)]
*  We had to choose [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1716.88s)]
*  And we chose to focus more of our attention on one driving down Trump because that was not being done in our ecosystem on our side [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1718.68s)]
*  And it was incredibly important that we did that as well as defining her and so if we spent this entire race and not to be [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1725.88s)]
*  Defensive about it at all [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1732.0s)]
*  But if we spent this entire race pushing back on immigration attacks or crime attacks and pushing back against trans attacks at what point are we? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1732.88s)]
*  Bringing Trump down and or introducing the vice president on our own terms [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1740.5600000000002s)]
*  We're playing on their field and I think that that was ultimately what went into it. But again, it wasn't something that we missed [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1744.84s)]
*  It's just all of our testing told us that the approach that we were taking of her being more positive and talking about the economy [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1750.3999999999999s)]
*  And what she would do was a better attack not to be sort of overly nerdy about it [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1756.24s)]
*  But that 7% is total money spent not number of ads run. Yes. Yes [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1760.24s)]
*  So it's higher than that terms of ads run because it was candidate side ads, right? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1764.56s)]
*  Yeah, but I mean probably like, you know, but we did I mean I would just add we did respond [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1767.68s)]
*  What our testing showed and look we there's no easy answers to this [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1773.72s)]
*  of course, but you know, we looked at this a lot and we [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1777.8600000000001s)]
*  You know and she never got directly asked about it, but was you know [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1781.64s)]
*  Obviously something we looked at in responding there [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1786.16s)]
*  But we did respond for the people that were getting this on digital and we did a ton more digital than the other side did [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1788.76s)]
*  But we definitely threw out ads to make sure anyone that was getting these directly we would be [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1794.48s)]
*  Engaging with them with a little bit more specific content [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1800.9s)]
*  Obviously she spoke to some of this in the Fox News interview and and the Trump administration [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1804.1000000000001s)]
*  oversight during this period [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1811.22s)]
*  But we saw that we could [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1812.98s)]
*  Neutralize the ad but we couldn't actually put points on the board for us if we did responded in kind [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1815.7800000000002s)]
*  So then you really have a question people don't know her they need to know more about who she is what she stands for [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1820.48s)]
*  They're concerned about the economy they're concerned about immigration and we need to push down Trump's numbers [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1826.6200000000001s)]
*  So how do you fit all of that in and what we tested? [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1831.82s)]
*  Showed us that ads that were much more as Quentin is saying on the economy or other issues that people cared more about [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1834.98s)]
*  Actually had better response [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1841.3400000000001s)]
*  For our testing then head-to-head so, you know you as we looked at this the the Trump side didn't close on this issue [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1844.9s)]
*  You know [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1851.86s)]
*  Obviously [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1852.4199999999998s)]
*  economy was far more effective and we had to really play the game there and we had a lot of work to do and we [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1853.26s)]
*  Were successful to a point [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1858.58s)]
*  But that's sort of the balance that we had and while we had a lot of resources in a short amount of time [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1860.34s)]
*  We were also trying to think about what does a person receive? [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1865.46s)]
*  We looked at certainly testing but we're looking at our qualitative and a lot of people thought it was very political [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1868.62s)]
*  They thought it was over-the-top. They had different kind of points of view that didn't really anchor it as a vote mover [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1874.5s)]
*  But I know it anecdotally had a lot of attention and and you know, they they played it in places that [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1880.8200000000002s)]
*  You know, we saw it and we monitor it monitored it as we went and I would just add in so [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1886.6200000000001s)]
*  Both campaigns super PACs. There was a lot of national ads [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1892.42s)]
*  So I think if you're sitting in California or Texas or Florida you see this ad you don't see any of our responses, right? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1895.5800000000002s)]
*  So in the battleground states [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1902.0600000000002s)]
*  You know her talking [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1904.9s)]
*  You know in a very common-sense way in a very practical way whether to be about immigration [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1907.66s)]
*  Whether it be about the economy was our best defense to because this was less about trans and it was about priorities and being out [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1912.66s)]
*  Of the mainstream [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1919.3000000000002s)]
*  So I think these voters in the battleground states both through ads and through seeing her doing local interviews [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1919.9s)]
*  And I think that's one of the reasons you had such a difference between the battleground states and the non battleground states as people knew [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1925.26s)]
*  Her better number one number two as Jen said, you know [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1931.1000000000001s)]
*  It's very easy these days to understand who has experience in ads [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1934.3s)]
*  So we were feeding a lot of digital ads to people who might have son saw that spot [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1938.78s)]
*  But you know at the end of the day we were spending a lot of time with voters in these battleground states both [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1943.3799999999999s)]
*  quantitatively and quantitatively and [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1947.94s)]
*  This trans ad was not driving vote. I mean the most effective ad Quentin [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1949.98s)]
*  I think they ran was not that it was the Biden omics ad right because that was kind of core to [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1953.78s)]
*  People's concern it was like well you maybe you're not change you're defending an economic program that I don't think's helped me listen [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1960.46s)]
*  I think we'll are very proud of what what Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and Democrats did to help us dig out of the [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1967.3s)]
*  Pandemic but people weren't feeling it. So that was more effective [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1972.98s)]
*  So I think in many respects my concern here as we think about the future is [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1976.1s)]
*  If there's a belief that if only we had responded to this trans ad with national and huge battleground state ads [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1981.74s)]
*  We would have won. I don't think that's true. Number one, you know number two, I think [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1989.62s)]
*  There's also a fact pattern here. So if we could have just said that's a lie. It's not anything she's ever believed [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=1995.34s)]
*  You know, she was on tape [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2000.3s)]
*  you know [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2001.86s)]
*  Surgery for trans for for people who want to transition in prison was part of the Biden Harris [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2004.3799999999999s)]
*  Platform in 2020 it was part of what the administration did, right? [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2011.4599999999998s)]
*  We also saw Colin all right and Sherrod Brown both who ran good races kind of directly responded to trans attacks and in our view [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2016.32s)]
*  You know, you're playing on your opponent's side of the field [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2023.68s)]
*  I understand why they felt they needed to do that in those states [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2026.08s)]
*  So to Quentin's point, you know, you have a set of things you're trying to get done [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2028.8799999999999s)]
*  It doesn't mean that you're in such a tunnel that when something comes at you that you don't we spent I mean Jen Quentin Stephanie [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2032.24s)]
*  I don't know dozens of hours on this like what should we do? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2040.16s)]
*  How are voters responding to it maybe hundreds of hours on it [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2043.56s)]
*  So we took it very seriously, but it wasn't something at the end of the day what matters in election is is [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2046.6399999999999s)]
*  Something causing someone to behave differently either who they vote for or whether they vote and [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2052.36s)]
*  Our sense was in the battleground states [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2059.2799999999997s)]
*  This was not driving vote behavior to the same extent like the economy was generally even immigration [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2063.72s)]
*  So I think that [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2071.9199999999996s)]
*  It's important to understand. I think that we were very much in [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2075.08s)]
*  voyeuristic listening mode here in terms of how our voters processing this and [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2080.0s)]
*  In the battleground states what we got from voters that doesn't seem like her like she seems sort of mainstream and normal number one [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2084.7999999999997s)]
*  It's a political attack and we trust it [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2091.7999999999997s)]
*  So I think in many respects Democrats who live outside of battleground states would see this at it and were convinced it was [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2093.94s)]
*  The thing that cost us the election, but I think in the battleground states. It was a different a different brew [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2101.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, I also the last point I'll make on this too is that I think again to [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2108.52s)]
*  Plus point about it moving vote [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2112.8s)]
*  I think that the Trump campaign knew that too and I think that the way in which they targeted this ad [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2114.76s)]
*  They target they were trying to I think make our job harder with black voters [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2120.04s)]
*  I'm just gonna say a point-blank and I think that specifically black men [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2124.8s)]
*  Ultimately, we got the same amount of the vote share that President Biden got with black men and we increased among black women [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2128.96s)]
*  But when you look at where Trump was running this ad it was in Philadelphia [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2133.96s)]
*  It was in Atlanta and then the outer markets where there wasn't as many diverse voters or black voters [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2138.3999999999996s)]
*  They weren't doing this we saw them targeting this in the mailboxes of black voters black male voters [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2144.3399999999997s)]
*  So there was this theory out there that we were struggling with black men [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2149.08s)]
*  And I think that while we were doing the work to try to make sure that that wasn't the case and we saw that [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2152.72s)]
*  Consolidation come back after President Biden got out of the race [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2157.8799999999997s)]
*  I think that Trump and them weren't using this ad to move vote share as much [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2160.18s)]
*  I think that they were using this ad to try to make our job of getting these voters back or consolidating them [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2164.6s)]
*  And I and I think ultimately if you look at it from that metric [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2170.7599999999998s)]
*  It wasn't effective [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2174.2999999999997s)]
*  but I think again the content of it and you know getting it from the way it was talked about in the press and narrated about [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2175.3599999999997s)]
*  You know this sort of earned echo chamber around these things can have much more of an impact on them than [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2182.64s)]
*  The money that's put behind them and I think that this trans ad is one of those because if you look at how Trump was [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2189.4s)]
*  Targeting it it didn't move those voters. He was targeting to plus point [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2194.7599999999998s)]
*  But I think it did make our job of sort of trying to get in front of them and making us seem like we knew [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2199.3199999999997s)]
*  What they were going through and we were focused on their problems much more difficult [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2205.04s)]
*  And so that's how I sort of see it [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2209.1s)]
*  But I don't think it was moving the boat and I mean the where we saw the first indication of what Quentin is talking about [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2210.98s)]
*  Is when Charlemagne started talking about it [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2217.1s)]
*  And that was when you know, we clued in that. Okay [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2219.54s)]
*  So their strategy isn't to pull in new voters to them is to mess with us and a day after Trump took the clip of Charlemagne [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2223.14s)]

*  You know, where does this come from and discovered that it was the Trump policy also? [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2247.02s)]
*  And tried to push that out there. The New York Times wrote about it [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2252.46s)]
*  We tried to force a discussion on it. It didn't ultimately get going [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2256.22s)]

*  In the post-election analysis there has been even from some folks anonymously at least inside the campaign [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2428.44s)]
*  some critique of some of the spending decisions around things like [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2434.0s)]
*  The set for Caller Daddy this, you know renting the sphere [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2438.0s)]

*  just want to get clarity on the point is that when you do you think when all of the [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2447.44s)]
*  When you guys have done all the books that whether the DNC will be in debt at the end of this race [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2451.92s)]
*  So first of all [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2457.48s)]
*  I think it was an extraordinary testament to the vice president to have the kind of grassroot support that she had [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2459.28s)]
*  And built on the foundation of the list and the support that President Biden had and had built and we cultivated over years [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2466.52s)]
*  We had some unique things that we had to do in this race [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2474.0s)]
*  That I think were really critical to do early and spent a lot of [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2478.08s)]
*  resources [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2482.72s)]
*  At an earlier stage than we would have is that ads ads but also the field programming we had [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2484.7599999999998s)]
*  Massive investment of staff, you know 3,000 staff hundreds and hundreds of offices in battleground states [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2491.8399999999997s)]
*  We had canvassers and and people out knocking doors and that's on that's pre Kamala Harris to or is it? [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2497.52s)]
*  Yes, we a hundred percent started at pre Kamala Harris and we've been building for the entire campaign [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2503.24s)]
*  But we really had to take it into hyperdrive because it wasn't we had so much work that we had to do [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2509.3199999999997s)]
*  We knew that we couldn't just reach people with one medium and we had to make sure we were maximizing it [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2514.8799999999997s)]
*  And we had to really move up spend when we're announcing the vice president as the new nominee [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2520.3599999999997s)]
*  We are you know a couple weeks later announcing a run of me [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2526.12s)]
*  We are you know building out who is she standing for all the things we've been talking about [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2529.44s)]
*  And so those things cost a lot of resources, especially when you're running seven states [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2534.04s)]
*  There was different opportunities for us to look at the battleground map and to say is anything moving away from us and [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2538.1200000000003s)]
*  We saw up until the very end that there was there was so much [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2545.5600000000004s)]
*  Every single state was in such a margin of error [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2551.2000000000003s)]
*  There was nothing that told us we couldn't play in one of these states [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2553.1600000000003s)]
*  And so and we needed to ensure with Pennsylvania, which was our toughest of the blue walls from the beginning where we were tied [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2556.28s)]
*  What's the alternative to make up those electoral votes? [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2563.72s)]
*  So we ran a very wide map in other races that some of us have worked on together [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2566.48s)]
*  We had to you know move off of states that was not actually part of our plan [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2571.0s)]
*  And then we had to reach very hard to find voters [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2575.96s)]
*  So we were trying to yes spend more resources on digital not for the sake of that [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2580.32s)]
*  But because we're trying to find young people we're trying to find these lower propensity voters that were tuned out to politics so much of the [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2586.48s)]
*  electorate pre vice president Harris and post had opted out of [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2592.88s)]
*  Political engagement had opted out of wanting to talk through or hear the kind of partisan environment [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2598.04s)]
*  So we had to work extremely hard to find them and doing so made us make really key choices [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2604.84s)]
*  Call her daddy was really an important choice to make and the hurricane which you're alluding to and why we had to make some [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2611.6800000000003s)]
*  Adjustments on schedule [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2618.44s)]
*  Yeah, the hurricane impacted two weeks of our ability to reach people not just in North Carolina and Georgia [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2619.84s)]
*  But all across the country I mean we put her on the weather channel in part because that's where people are watching so [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2625.32s)]
*  Everything of course you know you can look at did we get the best deal here. This was quite costly here [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2630.44s)]
*  It's quite expensive at the end of the day though [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2635.12s)]
*  I think the you know if you look at the spend we had majority of the money [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2638.0s)]
*  We spent it was to reach voters the money we spent at the end [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2642.76s)]
*  I mean Trump was every single day for the last two weeks of the race [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2645.4s)]
*  He was dumping millions of dollars on our head on more points, and we didn't go chase him everywhere [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2649.12s)]
*  But we had to look at what are people getting served how do we match that how are we hitting our voters and not getting distracted? [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2654.82s)]
*  How are we making sure the people that he's serving stuff to we're getting to and he had an army of [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2661.1600000000003s)]
*  Super PACs that were so coordinated. I'm sure there's some legal way they were communicate coordinated, but like sure it was legal [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2667.36s)]
*  Or illegal, but they you know it from the beginning they were you know week to week all you know [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2674.4s)]
*  One super PAC would take a couple weeks and hit, Pennsylvania [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2680.16s)]
*  And then the next one will come in and do the same and they're all coordinated [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2683.2s)]
*  We didn't have the benefit of that so I am very confident that [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2686.2s)]
*  The the fidelity of our finances was strong throughout and we focused it on direct voter contact [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2690.48s)]
*  You know you you mentioned the sphere of course is you well know to do something like that [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2696.2799999999997s)]
*  We had to make some bets pretty early on but we believed as we were closing the race [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2701.04s)]
*  That it was really important for people to feel like they were part of something bigger and that we were trying to identify [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2706.36s)]
*  opportunities to culturally reach people not just politically reach people [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2713.12s)]
*  So while the point of this year wasn't really necessary a Las Vegas play [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2717.58s)]
*  It was a play to get the kind of attention and awareness and to see in that you know the song [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2722.3s)]
*  And you know just you want to be part of that that was a big part of our strategy [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2727.88s)]
*  It's why in Philadelphia we spent and in all of our urban markets real resources on out-of-home [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2731.76s)]
*  Yes billboards, but also murals and other ways that people could [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2737.6s)]
*  Walk down the street, and they see something that's cultural and cool and something that connected with them [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2741.7200000000003s)]
*  Not in a political way to reach people and we felt like that was really really important for the voters [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2747.32s)]
*  We had to reach there is lots of [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2752.48s)]
*  Important work that the DNC does which we we worked in tandem and in partnership this whole time and part of the reason [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2755.3999999999996s)]
*  That the vice president was able to be so quick is because of the campaign [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2762.0s)]
*  But also because of the infrastructure and the work the DNC has done so they're gonna be in good stead [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2766.0s)]
*  They're gonna have everything they need they continue to have a lot of money that they put out to state parties all across the country [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2770.7999999999997s)]
*  It's part of the commitment that President Biden Vice President Harris made when they came into office so that work continues [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2776.24s)]
*  It doesn't just stop when there's a campaign they have more raising and more work to do [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2782.02s)]
*  But we are gonna be in a good space across the board across all of our entities without debt that carry without [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2785.74s)]
*  Yeah, okay having been through this [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2790.78s)]
*  You know some time ago [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2793.54s)]
*  But then witnessing again this time we have to stop playing a different game as it relates to super PACs than the Republicans [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2795.46s)]
*  Love our Democratic lawyers. I'm tired of it. Okay, they coordinate more than we do. I [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2802.2599999999998s)]
*  Think amongst themselves I think with the presidential campaign like I'm just sick and tired of it [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2808.1800000000003s)]
*  Okay, so we cannot be at a disadvantage number one number two to Jen's point [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2812.7400000000002s)]
*  I think you don't want duplication [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2817.2200000000003s)]
*  But I think having multiple players on the field as long as they're well coordinated is great like back in 20 [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2819.42s)]
*  You know I spent a bunch of time with Tara McGowan who now runs courier with acronym and all we did I think was 80 or [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2824.2200000000003s)]
*  90 million dollars which was which was great. We only did digital low information voters, right? [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2829.26s)]
*  So whatever a future forward was doing we were very focused on that particularly low information voters of color [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2835.14s)]
*  so I think to have an ecosystem where whether it's on issues like reproductive health or [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2841.9s)]
*  climate or you know manufacturing or health care or a [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2848.14s)]
*  Specific lane that you're focused on in terms of messaging. I think that's really really important [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2853.14s)]
*  I think that they tend to have [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2859.62s)]
*  More entities that are you know to Stephanie's point clearly it is not legal what they're doing [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2862.58s)]
*  But we are at a disadvantage when our folks are playing by a different set of rules than they are [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2869.66s)]
*  I mean, I remember going back to 2012 you guys might remember this like Mitt Romney is running around the country [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2874.98s)]
*  Asking for specific dollar amounts at Super PAC events and we were told that Barack Obama couldn't even attend them [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2882.1s)]
*  like [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2890.06s)]
*  The one event one event I think right right. So I just think at the end of the day. This is important again [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2891.06s)]
*  This is not at the top of the reasons that we had a different outcome here [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2897.06s)]
*  But you know to win close races you kind of want to be maximizing every piece of the arsenal [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2901.2999999999997s)]
*  And so I think this is something we really have to reflect on in and make some adjustments going forward [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2907.66s)]
*  Did you need more cavalry at the end? Can you talk a little about that? I think we need a more cavalry early [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2913.18s)]
*  Look I think there's a lot of really important discussions [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2919.5s)]
*  I know you're having and we'll all have about the path forward. I think our side was completely [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2922.58s)]
*  mismatched when it came to the [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2930.46s)]
*  ecosystem of Trump and his [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2933.58s)]
*  Super PACs and ours and you know [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2936.1s)]
*  That's not like a just a head-to-head comparison on points spent [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2939.18s)]
*  It is just how we have to think about our voters and what they need [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2942.82s)]
*  And we had a super PAC that was helpful very important and necessary [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2946.9s)]
*  For the work that they did because they were [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2952.98s)]
*  the kind of central [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2955.98s)]
*  recipient of a lot of the funding on our side and you know [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2959.26s)]
*  They staked a strategy and a plan and we clearly could see it and we knew what it was to spend late [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2962.82s)]
*  But we did not have the ability to have people come in with us early [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2969.02s)]
*  And so every ounce of advertising every ounce of [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2974.54s)]
*  carrying these strategic imperatives of defining the vice president and trying to bring down Trump's numbers all [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2978.7s)]
*  sat with us as a campaign and [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2983.94s)]
*  Because we had the strength of our list and because of the grassroots donors who were the heart and soul of this and and our major [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2986.1s)]
*  donors to [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2992.3s)]
*  At a level we have never seen in politics before we needed every cent of that because we carried like 90% of the bulk of it [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=2993.58s)]
*  and [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3000.78s)]
*  We needed to put North Carolina in play. We needed to make sure we're under running this big map [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3002.02s)]
*  We had a lot of work to do and we didn't really have [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3007.74s)]
*  Partners to call on in that early window at the same time [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3011.3s)]
*  There are really important groups out there that do important work that are target targeting [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3014.46s)]
*  key coalitions when we're talking about how we needed to [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3019.82s)]
*  reach young people and african-americans and latinos the voices and the strength of [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3022.86s)]
*  Organizations that are not [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3027.9s)]
*  This campaign that are not political that have a history and a foundation of doing this work that have [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3029.18s)]
*  Credibility with different communities is really important for us and I don't know that those entities got funded [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3035.3399999999997s)]
*  early enough, so I think this is just a question on this just in [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3041.1s)]
*  in the history of all of the [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3045.2999999999997s)]
*  presidential elections post-it is united the Democrats have had a [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3047.2999999999997s)]
*  Designated super PAC sort of I don't know what the legal term is [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3050.62s)]
*  Designated super PAC sort of I don't know what the legal term is [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3053.86s)]
*  But there's been one singular entity that was the recipient of all the super PAC dollars [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3057.02s)]
*  America it was priorities USA and 12 and 16 and then it's been future forward in 2024 [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3060.98s)]
*  Going forward your would your recommendation be that there be like the Republicans multiple entities that are all sort of viewed as [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3066.06s)]
*  important places for people looking to [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3074.1800000000003s)]
*  donate to go to [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3076.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean my [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3078.1800000000003s)]
*  My personal opinion that's why you're here [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3080.7000000000003s)]
*  Is that there are a lot of really important groups that do shit really well and they need the resources to go do that [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3084.3s)]
*  We don't need to recreate the wheel and we certainly don't need to funnel everything through one place. We need to have [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3090.54s)]
*  Groups that have the ability to reach these very difficult to reach voters in ways that can be compelling and long-lasting [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3097.7400000000002s)]
*  have the funding that they need to go do that and [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3105.9s)]
*  That to me means you are talking about a number of groups, of course [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3109.14s)]
*  You want them on the outside to coordinate well, and you don't want duplication [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3112.78s)]
*  We've certainly seen in previous presidentials where everyone was stepping on everyone else and spending money in duplication [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3116.74s)]
*  You don't want that either, but I think we have very sophisticated groups [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3122.54s)]
*  They do it on the Senate cycle after cycle and we have the benefit of learning and growing from that [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3125.94s)]
*  And I also think that we should let people do what they do [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3131.06s)]
*  And help support them in that and just have some coordination so that would be my [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3134.6600000000003s)]
*  recommendation going forward Stephanie one of the I'm believed to be the more tedious post-election debates is about [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3138.98s)]
*  Should Kamala Harris have gone on Rogan? Can you? [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3144.98s)]
*  Can you just not to be tedious about it? Could you talk a little bit about how close she came to doing it? [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3148.7400000000002s)]
*  Why it didn't happen? Yeah, there's a lot of intrigue around this a lot of theories. It's it's pretty simple [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3154.3s)]
*  We wanted to do it [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3161.3s)]
*  It you know, I hate to repeat this over and over but it was a very short race with a limited number of days and [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3163.54s)]
*  for a [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3171.3s)]
*  Candidate to leave the battleground to go to [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3173.2200000000003s)]
*  Houston [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3176.86s)]
*  Which is a day off the playing field in the battleground [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3178.26s)]
*  You know getting that timing right is really important. So [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3182.94s)]
*  We had discussions with Joe Rogan's team. They were great [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3188.82s)]
*  They wanted us to come on we wanted to come on [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3193.3s)]
*  We tried to get a date to to make it work and ultimately we just weren't able to find a date [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3195.5s)]
*  We did go to Houston [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3200.6200000000003s)]
*  And she gave a great speech at an amazing event [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3202.7400000000002s)]
*  The Beyonce event that yes. Well, I'm gonna call it reproductive freedom [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3206.82s)]
*  and [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3211.26s)]
*  Because Texas is ground zero for the impact of these Trump abortion bans [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3212.54s)]
*  There's a story out today. In fact of another young woman who lost her life because of it [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3217.54s)]
*  And [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3222.68s)]
*  We were hoping to be able to fit it in around that [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3223.88s)]
*  And ultimately weren't able to do it as it turns out. That was the day that Trump was taping his Joe Rogan [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3226.68s)]
*  So which they had never confirmed to us. We kind of figured that out [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3233.68s)]
*  In the lead-up to it, you know [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3238.6s)]
*  She was ready willing to to go on Joe Rogan. Would it have changed anything? You know, it would have been a [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3241.76s)]
*  It would have broken through not because of the conversation with Joe Rogan [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3250.12s)]
*  But because the fact that she was doing it and that was really the benefit of it [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3254.04s)]
*  Will she do it sometime in the future? Maybe who knows? [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3258.52s)]
*  But but it you know didn't ultimately impact the outcome one way or the other [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3262.92s)]
*  But she was she she was willing to to do whatever it takes [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3268.12s)]
*  Yeah, Dan, so what's clear is we offer to do it in Austin people should know that didn't work out [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3271.3599999999997s)]
*  I think you know, maybe they leveraged out to get Trump in the studio [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3275.96s)]
*  I don't know and then you know [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3279.0s)]
*  We were obviously not gonna be back in Texas but offer to do it on the roads and he wouldn't travel right? [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3281.0s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with Stephanie like I don't know at the end of the day how much it would have driven vote [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3285.88s)]
*  But listen the reason that we [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3291.16s)]
*  the night of the first debate [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3294.12s)]
*  Challenged Trump to a second debate we were gonna do that whether that first debate went good bad or indifferent [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3297.92s)]
*  We needed big moments we were behind in the race with a candidate who was not fully defined [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3302.56s)]
*  Trump did a ton of podcast like let's put Rogan aside, but as I said, I don't you know win or lose [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3307.7599999999998s)]
*  It would have been a big moment. You don't win or lose the campaign on one podcast [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3311.52s)]
*  That was the core of Trump's media strategy was to do a bunch of these podcasts. They were [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3315.08s)]
*  Not political podcasts per se they were probably political adjacent right adjacent [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3319.36s)]
*  it's my understanding that you guys wanted to do a bunch of the [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3324.16s)]
*  larger more popular [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3329.6s)]
*  Not specifically political podcasts [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3331.68s)]
*  Can you talk about why that may not have happened like look if you for example hot ones [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3335.08s)]
*  Like they're never never in time is there been a candidate better suited for a podcast and Kamala Harris on podcast on hot ones, so I [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3341.96s)]
*  Think if I remember correctly on hot ones that they didn't want to delve into politics and that that's across the board [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3350.52s)]
*  Yeah, but some of them did yeah, we had I think real opportunity for some [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3356.2799999999997s)]
*  core podcasts that hit [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3361.64s)]
*  Key constituencies on the smoke Club Shayshae, you know, she's everywhere we could we did it [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3364.6s)]
*  But I do think we had a lot of support in a number of you know athletes and others that were just not [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3370.48s)]
*  Super interested in getting their brand caught up in the politics of this campaign [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3379.64s)]
*  And I don't think he had the same problem now [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3384.3199999999997s)]
*  He wasn't talking to the kind of folks [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3387.52s)]
*  You know that we were trying to get and these are big names that their reputations will be tied into it [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3389.92s)]
*  But you know [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3395.04s)]
*  He I think certainly was able to tap into some cultural elements in ways that we couldn't and [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3395.96s)]
*  I think that that had an impact on us that there were places that we knew we had support that we [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3401.76s)]
*  Desperately wanted to go and have conversation that we thought would be interesting and relevant and fun and we couldn't get there [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3406.84s)]
*  But we did get to a number of places that I think were really impactful for us hitting [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3413.0s)]
*  men [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3417.56s)]
*  African American men Latino men we had a number of opportunities there that I think when we could do it [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3418.44s)]
*  We absolutely did it and it was a top priority for us [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3423.4s)]
*  And the truth is when Trump would go on these podcasts the conversation wasn't political [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3425.64s)]
*  You know and we saw that and you know, we did lots of outreach to many of the same podcasts that he went on [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3431.44s)]
*  Ultimately, you know as we said with everything in this campaign [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3438.72s)]
*  We had to pick and choose because of the limitations on time [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3442.64s)]
*  But I do also want to say that Tim Walls was a huge podcaster and was on Pat podcasts all the time [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3445.96s)]
*  And you know the in the politics adjacent space that you were talking about sports hunting [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3453.28s)]
*  You know fishing running [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3461.44s)]
*  Football generally he went on smart lists a whole host of them. So we were we definitely [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3464.04s)]
*  See the value in this strategy. I guess the the thing that [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3470.2400000000002s)]
*  That is was different about our campaign versus Trump's [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3474.64s)]
*  Are a couple of things one, you know all of his podcasts were reaching [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3479.64s)]
*  The the audience that we were struggling to pull in [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3485.08s)]
*  young young young men [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3490.92s)]
*  And and we saw that we knew that [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3492.96s)]
*  And number two in addition to doing podcasts. We were also doing earned media and [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3496.0s)]
*  He was doing a little bit of that but it was mostly right-wing [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3501.6s)]
*  Media anything mainstream he would book it and then they would cancel it [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3505.68s)]
*  So, you know how people viewed our campaign doing the earned media in addition to the podcast the podcast kind of got lost in that conversation [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3510.6s)]
*  I'm sort of fascinated by the fact that you know four years ago the idea that it would be more politically problematic to have on these [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3518.88s)]
*  Kamala Harris the senior vice president of the United States [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3525.92s)]
*  Than Donald Trump a man who's been convicted of a crime and tried to violently overthrow the election [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3527.8s)]
*  Do you have any theories as to why that is is specific about the people he was talking to is it establishment versus anti-establishment? [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3533.0400000000004s)]
*  politics or it's not politics of [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3540.28s)]
*  Yeah, why people would be [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3543.36s)]
*  Some folks would be more feel more comfortable for their brand to have a convicted criminal on then the city vice president [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3545.28s)]
*  It was never a choice like we'll have him but we're not gonna have you [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3551.2400000000002s)]
*  Anybody that took him would take us [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3554.88s)]
*  It was more some of the like like hot ones, which is a great [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3556.92s)]
*  show [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3562.4s)]
*  They didn't want to do any politics. So they weren't gonna take us or him. So that was the issue [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3563.96s)]
*  And but we you know, we got on plenty of them and you know [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3569.84s)]
*  The bottom line is she was willing to do just about anything and have a conversation with anybody [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3574.84s)]
*  She did more traditional media than Trump did as you point out there basically none like [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3579.64s)]
*  Got shit from the interested party, you know the media that wasn't getting their interview but voters don't give a shit [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3588.0s)]
*  Wait, Trump got shit for that. That's what I'm saying. We got shit [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3595.04s)]
*  Oh, we oh, yes, we got tons of shit that she wasn't doing enough media. He got no, you know, not you know, yeah [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3598.56s)]
*  Like don't even get me going on that [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3605.72s)]
*  Like now that the campaign's over and you sort of identified who sort of the voters were who moved at the end [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3608.16s)]
*  How do you feel about the utility of some of that earned media stuff? [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3614.04s)]
*  Is it now feel a little bit like we're just sort of talking to our own people all the time? [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3618.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and not even the well it [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3623.68s)]
*  In terms of who the targets were the persuadable voters, which were largely young men [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3627.64s)]
*  They're not watching the evening news. They're not watching cable. They definitely do not watch 60 minutes [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3633.04s)]
*  So older voters, you know, maybe that's why vice president did a little bit better with senior citizens [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3639.6s)]
*  You know, but you know, look our background is doing lots of earned media through the course of our careers [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3646.6s)]
*  Does it help and where we stand now? [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3653.8s)]
*  You know, if you're a candidate with a limited amount of time [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3656.32s)]
*  But did it [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3659.4399999999996s)]
*  Screw with our narrative not just in getting shit for not doing enough earned media [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3661.4399999999996s)]
*  But getting questions that we knew voters weren't going to care about [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3665.8399999999997s)]
*  And you know their myopic mindset on certain issues was not what the race was going to be about [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3670.2s)]
*  So at a certain point we had to decide is this helping us or not? [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3677.04s)]
*  And we had to decide is this helping us or not? [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3680.68s)]
*  And we had to decide is this helping us or not? [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3682.68s)]
*  Race was gonna be about so at a certain point we had to decide is this helping us or hurting us and [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3684.68s)]
*  What did you decide? [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3692.3999999999996s)]
*  I would say I mean look I am NOT [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3695.3999999999996s)]
*  media hater by any measure and I think that [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3700.04s)]
*  You know, we women don't get far in life talking about double standards. So that's not the point but I do think a narrative [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3704.0s)]
*  100 seven days two weeks fucked up because of a hurricane two weeks talking about how she didn't do interviews [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3711.6s)]
*  Which you know, she was doing plenty but we were doing in our own way [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3717.92s)]
*  We had to you know be the nominee had to find a running mate and do a rollout [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3721.3599999999997s)]
*  I mean there was all these things that you kind of want to factor in but real people heard in some way that we were [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3726.6s)]
*  not going to have interviews which was both not true and also so [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3734.04s)]
*  Counter to any kind of standard that was put on Trump that I think that was a problem and then on top of that [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3739.88s)]
*  We would do an interview and to Stephanie's point the questions were [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3745.72s)]
*  small and [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3750.8s)]
*  processy and about like [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3752.12s)]
*  dumb they weren't they were not [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3754.4s)]
*  Informing a voter who was trying to listen to learn more or to understand and I'm not [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3756.8s)]
*  Say that that you know, the whole system was focused on us and correctly [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3762.6s)]
*  I'm just saying like again of the things we need to explore as we move forward as a campaign and as a country [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3766.88s)]
*  that does a disservice to voters and you know, I think back and think we should have signaled more of our strategy early on about [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3772.28s)]
*  podcasts and who we were trying to reach and [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3779.8s)]
*  But we had a limited amount of time to reach the people are trying to reach and we were trying to go to them [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3781.96s)]
*  But being up against a narrative that we weren't doing anything or we were afraid to have interviews is [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3786.52s)]
*  Completely bullshit and also like took hold a little bit and we just gave us another thing we had to fight back for [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3793.34s)]
*  That Trump never had to worry about [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3798.46s)]
*  pluff I want to talk a little bit about the [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3800.58s)]
*  Decisions towards the end around [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3805.02s)]
*  campaigning with the Cheney's [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3807.38s)]
*  doing the events with the Republicans the sort of the [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3809.1400000000003s)]
*  Pivot or you know around like the statement you guys did after the John Kelly fascism comments [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3813.46s)]
*  I [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3818.38s)]
*  Know at the end of every campaign everyone in a losing campaign [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3819.5s)]
*  At least everyone then looks at it from the outside looks at it and says the reason [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3822.7s)]
*  Our side losses confirms whatever priors I had beforehand [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3826.66s)]
*  But one of the arguments particularly some folks on the left are making is that doing this stuff with Cheney and Republicans [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3829.5s)]
*  suppressed turnout among the base [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3835.82s)]
*  Just talk a little bit why you decided to do the stuff with Cheney whether you saw any blowback at all in your data [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3838.94s)]
*  Well, first of all, you know like any organization, you know, that's [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3843.94s)]
*  Got the resources in the private sector or in this case in politics [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3849.78s)]
*  You make as many decisions as you can based on data by the marketplace. Okay, so [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3853.76s)]
*  You know turn out was up in Milwaukee was down a little bit in Philadelphia in Detroit [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3861.26s)]
*  But you know, we'd spent a lot of time with voters who we were concerned weren't gonna vote and the fact that Liz Cheney was supporting [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3866.86s)]
*  Kamala Harris was not an issue raised by any of them [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3873.8999999999996s)]
*  Okay, so I'd say a couple things we were in a challenging political environment [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3876.7799999999997s)]
*  We're to get to 50% of the vote in enough states to win 270 electoral votes [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3881.7s)]
*  We needed some percentage of Republicans, but I think what people forget is it's more the [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3886.3399999999997s)]
*  independents who act like Republicans where issues of [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3892.5s)]
*  Democracy of how unhinged he is project 2025 mattered to them [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3897.06s)]
*  Even as some conservative Democrats also when you're being attacked as being a crazy out-of-touch [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3902.06s)]
*  California liberal when you have generals [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3907.66s)]
*  and [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3910.58s)]
*  former Republican elected officials [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3911.66s)]
*  Saying I'm for Kamala Harris that helps rebut that in many respects. That'll be more effective than what she would say herself [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3914.38s)]
*  and then as it relates to [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3921.2599999999998s)]
*  You know the comments about you know wanting generals like Hitler that bothered voters [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3923.46s)]
*  Okay, this is something that [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3929.46s)]
*  Concerned them about okay. He seems like he's lost a step. He seems a little more unhinged [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3932.2999999999997s)]
*  unstable the people who worked for him last time are warning us and [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3938.54s)]
*  Now he says something like this. So yeah, we could have decided to ignore that and just say let's talk about tax cuts today [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3942.74s)]
*  I don't think that would advance the ball with the people we needed to advance it with and again [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3949.1s)]
*  I just want to again it can sound like making excuses this political environment sucked [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3953.9s)]
*  Okay, we were dealing with ferocious headwinds and I think people's instinct [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3958.3999999999996s)]
*  Was to give the Republicans and even Donald Trump another chance [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3964.3199999999997s)]
*  So we had a complicated puzzle to put together here in terms of the voters and it was going to take a little bit more [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3968.0s)]
*  Independent Republicans than we saw in 20 maybe a percent more Republican [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3974.2s)]
*  Voters for us. It was going to take voters saying even though I judged Trump's first turn favorably [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3978.8799999999997s)]
*  More concerned about him this time we had to get more voters to say that [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3985.2799999999997s)]
*  So, you know and if you look at how we closed [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3990.44s)]
*  I think we did one day with with Liz Cheney in the last couple of weeks [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3993.7599999999998s)]
*  You look at the ads we ran they were heavily centered on the economy on tax cuts on [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=3997.12s)]
*  Trump being for the wealthy so this notion that somehow we weren't focused on the economy that was the driving [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4003.32s)]
*  Motivation and message in our campaign the closing speech. Yes, it took place at the ellipse was a [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4011.46s)]
*  Huge contrast on the economy and the people Donald Trump would fight for and the people Connell Harris would fight for so I think that mistakes [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4017.7999999999997s)]
*  You know, I think my concern about that is just again [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4026.2s)]
*  We have to understand that what happened in this election and what didn't and you know, I think at the end of the day [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4030.14s)]
*  We had to raise [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4037.62s)]
*  People's concern and the threat level of a Trump second term [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4039.9s)]
*  I think if you look at our internal data and Quentin can speak to this we did a lot of that [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4044.38s)]
*  We just didn't get it to the extent that we needed to to win. But at the end of the day, I think people [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4050.22s)]
*  You know [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4056.18s)]
*  It was the price of eggs that drove a lot of the the debate here and I think Trump's gonna be in hot water [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4056.8199999999997s)]
*  Because he's gonna do a lot of stuff starting January 20th. That's not gonna be about the price of eggs [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4061.9s)]
*  It's gonna be about sort of the MAGA ideological pursuits that his he and his base will insist happen whether that's pardoning January 6 [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4067.3s)]
*  Rioters were some of the other things around health care and immigration [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4075.94s)]
*  So but but I think Dan that it is important [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4078.5800000000004s)]
*  we spent a lot of time with voters in the aftermath of those comments from Milley and [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4081.82s)]
*  About you know desiring generals like Hitler and it bothered voters [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4087.54s)]
*  So again, that wasn't the core of our campaign [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4091.38s)]
*  The core of our campaign was an economic contrast in these battleground states, but it was an important element of it [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4094.06s)]
*  Quinn can you talk a little bit about? [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4099.02s)]
*  You know at the end, you know [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4101.18s)]
*  There was a you know [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4102.78s)]
*  I'll be curious in your data how many what percent of people in the last week were undecided or movable and [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4103.7s)]
*  Sort of who those voters were and I know that a lot of folks in the campaign were [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4109.06s)]
*  Said that you know in that last week where it seemed like the vice president that seemed like was clearly closing very strongly and Trump [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4112.86s)]
*  Was sort of seemed to be imploding everywhere [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4119.5s)]
*  Just were you guys were the fight were the last voters moving in your direction there just wasn't enough time or did Trump [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4122.84s)]
*  You know win those late deciders. I mean, it's hard. Look you won the election [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4129.4400000000005s)]
*  So it's it's hard to say that they they broke our way, but look we saw a shrinking pool of undecided voters [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4134.5s)]
*  All the way until the end [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4140.08s)]
*  And as Jen mentioned Republicans were turning out early to vote [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4141.96s)]
*  We were looking at it to see if it was mode shifting meaning were these people who would only vote on Election Day [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4145.72s)]
*  As Republicans just voting early and that was the case and then so we sort of knew this wasn't some surge [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4150.599999999999s)]
*  You know for public and voters turning out [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4156.16s)]
*  And you know ultimately not enough of them broke our way [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4158.959999999999s)]
*  These are those voters that were in that margin that we were counting on to get us over that hump [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4162.44s)]
*  You know to your previous question that you just asked in that pluff answered [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4167.08s)]
*  You know, I think that there's a lot of things to learn in this election, but I think over learning some of them [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4170.759999999999s)]
*  Is a danger as well [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4175.759999999999s)]
*  There's a number of states that will be on the board including in 26 that are Senate races that [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4177.2s)]
*  Will be very hard to win without getting some of those voters that we were talking to and I think those Republican [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4182.12s)]
*  Those Republican leaning voters, I mean and if you look at it and again this probably sounds [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4187.88s)]
*  I hope it doesn't sound defensive to the people listening because it's really not but if you look at 22 and you look at 20 [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4192.24s)]
*  That's how Democrats won these races [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4197.92s)]
*  And I mean 9% of Republican voters voted for Raphael Warnock in Georgia in 2020 and you managed his race [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4200.0s)]
*  And there's no there is no democratic majority without the state of Georgia and so when you're looking at some of these states [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4205.08s)]
*  North Carolina Sherry Beasley almost got there in 22 [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4211.24s)]
*  She didn't but if she had gotten a little bit more those Republican voters [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4214.08s)]
*  And of course look if you can turn out more of your base voters that is good [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4216.36s)]
*  But especially as we head into a midterm and we also saw these voters beginning that trend of coming to Democrats in 2020 [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4220.5199999999995s)]
*  From the Biden race was the first time they did it in [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4227.88s)]
*  In 2022 we said can we hold these voters we ran strategies to try to do that [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4230.24s)]
*  We were successful at doing it [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4235.2s)]
*  So these voters had given us indications that they were you know willing to be open to Democrats [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4236.5599999999995s)]
*  And we spoke to them and we kept trying to speak to them that we saw some of them going back in Trump's [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4243.599999999999s)]
*  Favorability to that piece and so a lot of this was getting that down and you could either have a Democrat trying to give [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4248.16s)]
*  That message or you can have generals and people who worked for Trump [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4253.28s)]
*  And they're in your net data said those probably had more credibility to do that than a Democrat [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4255.76s)]
*  100% and so I just think that you know at the end of the day [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4259.32s)]
*  There's obviously work that needs to be done on both sides [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4263.32s)]
*  But I would caution just trying to say that you should just throw that to the wind [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4265.92s)]
*  Especially you know and maybe it maybe it doesn't with Trump [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4269.8s)]
*  But you know to the point of how we got here and the voters that allowed us to get to this point [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4273.08s)]
*  I think a lot of those voters [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4278.7s)]
*  And I think that that was a big part of it [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4280.0s)]
*  And I don't I think it's a false choice to say it has to be one or the other [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4281.88s)]
*  I think that that is a mistake [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4285.6s)]
*  I think we just have to do everything and we have to do it better [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4287.28s)]
*  But I don't think that this is saying that by trying to win those voters who have shown you in the past two cycles that [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4290.24s)]
*  They are open to Democrats you are abandoning the base well [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4296.72s)]
*  And I would just add I agree with this so much [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4300.32s)]
*  And I think to win you need you need to have moderate Republicans and [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4303.08s)]
*  Progressives of all ages like we cannot win without these core elements [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4308.72s)]
*  We don't have the luxury of choosing one group of voter or another but in the battleground states [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4313.36s)]
*  We were heavily focused on suburbs. We knew they were very important in 22 obviously [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4319.4s)]
*  we're very focused on on women in particular, but moderates independence and [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4324.799999999999s)]
*  The vice president actually did better in the Wow counties in Wisconsin than Joe Biden did and while the rest of the country moved [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4330.5599999999995s)]
*  Five points to the right in the suburbs we moved a point to the right so that isn't enough [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4338.16s)]
*  to win but just a reminder that like we understood the work we had to do and [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4345.6s)]
*  When your opponent is trying to make you more extreme and to make you dangerously liberal [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4350.76s)]
*  The ways you can push back on that [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4356.64s)]
*  You know we talked about the trans ad earlier is by having people stand with you that don't agree with you on everything [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4358.88s)]
*  But do see in you it wasn't just that the Republicans that stood with us were saying they were against Trump [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4364.599999999999s)]
*  They were also saying they were for the vice president and why and I think that had a real impact not enough [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4371.16s)]
*  But it definitely was an important calculus to the broader framing that Trump was trying to drive [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4376.44s)]
*  People to us and to also just by having these folks stand with us at the volume that they were standing for any reason [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4382.28s)]
*  They were with us. It wasn't just about democracy [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4389.04s)]
*  It wasn't just about January 6 that really showed to people who didn't know her that well that if those [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4391.08s)]
*  Republicans would stand with her well [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4397.8s)]
*  She couldn't be so extreme and dangerously liberal as Trump was trying to frame because these folks won't be with her [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4399.28s)]
*  You know as a baseline. It's always worth reminding people [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4405.2s)]
*  It's really hard for Democrats to win battleground states [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4409.0s)]
*  Okay [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4413.2s)]
*  Let's look at Pennsylvania 25% the electorate is liberal roughly [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4414.56s)]
*  Thirty four percent's conservative by the way in most battleground states that conservative numbers over 40 [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4419.54s)]
*  So in every battleground state there's more conservative than levels. So in Pennsylvania effects, it should believe Trump won conservatives 91 8 [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4424.54s)]
*  Harris won liberals 93 6 [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4431.9s)]
*  Moderates Harris won 56 43, but you kind of got to win 60% of them, right? [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4434.22s)]
*  So, you know for Democrats to win battleground states to Quentin and Jen's point [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4438.74s)]
*  It's it is a false choice you want to maximize your base, of course [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4443.54s)]
*  And that was a place where we spent enormous time a lot of resources that's critical. And obviously I think in Milwaukee [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4447.3s)]
*  You know just to use use that an example. We hit our turnout targets fell a little bit short and Philly in Detroit [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4454.9s)]
*  So that's not good. That's part of the equation [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4460.26s)]
*  You've got a couple that with dominating in the middle not just winning it a little we have to dominate the moderate vote and [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4462.5s)]
*  And I think as we look ahead to 26 and 28 [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4471.18s)]
*  Particularly where you have seen drift amongst non-college voters generally particularly those of color specifically [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4474.740000000001s)]
*  You know, we obviously have to get some of that back. We can't afford any more erosion there [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4481.1s)]
*  The math just doesn't fucking work. Okay [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4484.740000000001s)]
*  But I don't think this is a permanent realignment. But the point here is to win battleground states [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4488.3s)]
*  Yes, of course, you have to maximize your turnout and your vote share amongst liberal voters if you're Democrat [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4493.26s)]
*  That was a huge focus you've got to win the center speaking of realignment, right? [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4497.82s)]
*  Like I think in a lot of ways it's fair to say this is an anomalous election [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4502.74s)]
*  Trump is a unique candidate former incumbent president you were obviously global trends taking place here [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4505.42s)]
*  But you know, I think what? [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4511.7s)]
*  you guys all want to do what I want to take from this conversation is like how do we project forward for the next races and [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4513.9s)]
*  I think one of the bigger concerns you look at these numbers for the future of the Democratic Party in national politics is will Latino voters [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4519.62s)]
*  rights based on exits, which I know are imprecise but [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4526.179999999999s)]
*  Since 2012 they have moved 29 points to the right like that is [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4530.58s)]
*  Unsustainable and the map becomes impossible and the Senate like a durable Senate majority is impossible if you're losing [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4535.7s)]
*  voter Latino voters at that number [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4541.46s)]
*  What did you guys see with Latinos because yes like inflation is an issue here [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4543.099999999999s)]
*  But we also had a pretty big shift from 16 to 20 [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4548.139999999999s)]
*  So, what were you just just seen with Latino voters and any thoughts you have on how we begin if you have them yet on [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4551.4s)]
*  How we begin to move back? [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4556.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think this is super tough, you know, I think we saw as you're saying this isn't just for 24 [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4558.88s)]
*  You know, we saw it in 20 where you know, we spent [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4566.16s)]
*  so much time and resources and I thought even in 20 did a [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4570.04s)]
*  Really good job from a campaign standpoint to reach Latino voters in particular [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4575.36s)]
*  And I think we missed the mark then [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4579.84s)]
*  And in that instance, I think it was economic broadly, right? And that was such a conversation about coven and then the economy [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4582.8s)]
*  I think you know, we really saw in hindsight [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4589.92s)]
*  We should have been far more on the economy and and and kovat kind of second [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4592.92s)]
*  But you know, look I think as you look at 24 [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4596.28s)]
*  first of all [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4599.34s)]
*  as you well know Latino voters are not a monolith and in every [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4600.08s)]
*  Battleground state in every state in the country that have a cohort of Latino voters that make up the electorate [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4604.16s)]
*  They're very different and I think certainly the national numbers look particularly bad because they incorporate Florida and in [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4609.96s)]
*  In Texas, but we also, you know saw a shift in this trend as you're saying [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4618.52s)]
*  That we have a lot of work to do. I think that it's Latino men in particular. I do think though the smaller [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4624.68s)]
*  Shift right happened in in Pennsylvania and and you know, there's a heavy Puerto Rican [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4630.98s)]
*  Community there outside of Philly inside of Philly [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4637.219999999999s)]
*  And I think you know [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4639.4s)]
*  Obviously that was a big part of the close and where we did see some movement after the Trump Madison Square Garden [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4640.259999999999s)]
*  Really exactly exactly. So, you know look at the end of the day [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4645.62s)]
*  I think a lot of this is really baked into the right track wrong track and the economic concerns and I think you know [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4648.78s)]
*  That's fundamental. I also don't know that [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4654.9s)]
*  Latino voters are you know, one again not just monolithic but maybe not an anomaly to other people in their communities [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4657.58s)]
*  And they're feeling the same concerns that people have but I think globally with men with Latino men in particular [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4665.66s)]
*  With you know, obviously we talked about the work we did with African American men [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4673.5s)]
*  I mean, I would say African Americans have been on the same trend line since oh eight even where we've seen [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4676.98s)]
*  Decrease in support cycle after cycle which we were able to hold off this time [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4683.9s)]
*  So I think there is a lot more work to do to kind of understand this more and think about it [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4688.86s)]
*  But I don't think it is the work of just a hundred seven day campaign or even a presidential campaign [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4693.299999999999s)]
*  And I think that's probably the biggest answer of where do we go from here on all of this? [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4698.82s)]
*  How do we ensure that people in this country? [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4704.259999999999s)]
*  See themselves and what we're selling and that we have solutions that make sense to people and that we can understand what they're going through and that they see themselves [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4708.1s)]
*  Reflected in those solutions and you know [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4718.1s)]
*  I think there's just a lot of work that to me it is never going to be we have to make choices about one type of [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4720.26s)]
*  Voter versus another but everyone has to see you know [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4725.900000000001s)]
*  Not just our our brand as a party but more importantly our candidates as people who are providing [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4729.02s)]
*  Solutions and really can make connections and and that there's a path for that and I think the vice president [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4735.14s)]
*  To her credit was exceptional at this at every turn during this campaign [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4740.54s)]
*  Very clear on her vision very clear on who she was very clear on the issues that she understood people cared about and really [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4745.38s)]
*  How to do something about it, and I think that really broke through [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4752.94s)]
*  But I think these younger voters in particular that you know [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4756.26s)]
*  Fundamentally are hard to reach to begin with and part of our conversation earlier [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4760.78s)]
*  You have the same challenges with these different cohorts to reach reach voters and have an impact and in a way that they can feel [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4765.7s)]
*  Connected to what we're doing, but also just finding them to have that conversation. I think was complicated it Stephanie [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4773.06s)]
*  It felt like one of the driving forces of this campaign was that there was a segment of voters primarily young men [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4779.5s)]
*  Who were simply and seemed almost impossible to reach with the traditional tools that Democrats have [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4785.18s)]
*  Linear TV to some extent certainly earned media as you mentioned [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4790.46s)]
*  It appears that Trump had some ability to reach them and you know [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4795.06s)]
*  there is a argument very much by which is the difference between the national and the battleground states was because [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4799.38s)]
*  You guys were in the battleground states campaigning, but there's also an alarming version of that which is [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4806.02s)]
*  Where we are not spending a billion dollars in field and TV the country is moving farther to the right because organically [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4811.3s)]
*  Some groups of voters are getting [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4818.94s)]
*  Right-leaning messaging or anti-democratic messaging [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4821.86s)]
*  Which is what did you guys sort of see about that group of voters are hard to reach in any thoughts you have yet? [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4824.38s)]
*  And I would not blame you for not having them yet about how we can reach those folks going forward [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4828.74s)]
*  Well, I would say a couple of things [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4833.26s)]
*  Like you said this race was [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4835.82s)]
*  You know a little different than most anything else Trump is a different kind of candidate [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4838.66s)]
*  We had a candidate a Democratic candidate get in a hundred and seven days out [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4844.54s)]
*  part of an administration [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4849.58s)]
*  Coming out of kovat inflation, etc [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4851.62s)]
*  You know Trump never stopped Trump, you know [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4853.98s)]
*  Obviously it's important to him that he portrayed this very masculine strong figure [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4858.179999999999s)]
*  And so how does that show up for people it shows up at UFC fights? It shows up with Dana [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4864.0599999999995s)]
*  White speaking at the convention it shows up [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4871.0199999999995s)]
*  With the kind of podcast that he's doing it shows up in his rhetoric [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4874.54s)]
*  And he's constantly picking a fight and showing that he's gonna take something on [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4879.34s)]
*  I'm not saying we mimic that we don't want to mimic that [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4884.26s)]
*  But we have to pay attention to why people find that appealing [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4888.94s)]
*  and [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4894.14s)]
*  his use of tik-tok and [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4895.26s)]
*  specifically reaching [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4898.06s)]
*  Those younger men I can't tell you how many friends of mine or nieces and nephews would say to me [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4899.54s)]
*  Do you know I'm getting these things from Trump all the time on tik-tok and they're not political people [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4905.38s)]
*  They weren't signing up for that stuff, but Trump was reaching them. So there's there is a lot for us to learn in that [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4910.7s)]
*  But I will also say a lot of that was very specific to that candidate [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4918.0199999999995s)]
*  You know in his messaging and why that was [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4922.7s)]
*  While people were open to that messaging [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4926.139999999999s)]
*  We can go really deep into why and we can go into a conversation on [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4929.139999999999s)]
*  people thinking that Democrats are squishy and you know our [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4935.0599999999995s)]
*  You know the conversation we just had about transgenders and the conversation that [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4940.0199999999995s)]
*  Republicans in the house are trying to make us have on bathrooms right now [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4944.94s)]
*  And you know we or we [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4950.22s)]
*  Can talk about how we're gonna get people's wages up how we're gonna [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4952.86s)]
*  You know create programs for people that don't go to college [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4956.5s)]
*  But still can figure out how to build their careers about how we finally you know address the sandwich [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4959.179999999999s)]
*  Generations like the vice president was trying to have of caring for kids and being able to afford childcare [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4965.2s)]
*  But also having to care for ailing parents. These are the type of issues that aren't squishy or masculine, but they are real life [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4971.339999999999s)]
*  And I think if there's one conversation that we should have as Democrats we got to get back to those issues [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4979.38s)]
*  Because those are our issues [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4986.099999999999s)]
*  We're the ones that find the solutions to those and and you know and and my coming up in politics [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4988.099999999999s)]
*  We're the only ones that cared about them [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4992.98s)]
*  We have to get back to those bread-and-butter type issues that change people's lives even that 35 year old man [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=4994.58s)]
*  Who finds the masculine? [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5002.94s)]
*  Rhetoric and [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5005.46s)]
*  Tik Toks and youtubers appealing [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5007.7s)]
*  He still has to pay his kids childcare bills, so it's a [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5010.9s)]
*  It's a it's a choice that we have to make Jen said earlier that [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5016.379999999999s)]
*  You know this isn't the problem of a hundred and seven day campaign to solve. It's a party problem [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5020.58s)]
*  Mm-hmm Republicans don't make Trump apologize [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5025.259999999999s)]
*  And Stephanie said we don't have to mimic it [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5028.82s)]
*  And [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5031.5s)]
*  Stephanie said we don't have to mimic it [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5032.58s)]
*  But I think that there are a lot of times where if you're in the Democratic Party and you step out of line [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5034.78s)]
*  Yeah, you get punished for it. That's not by trying to say [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5039.9s)]
*  Thank you for being more direct [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5043.5s)]
*  You get you get punished for it by by your own party [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5045.5s)]
*  Republicans do not do that [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5050.14s)]
*  Comments in the 2019 primary, you know, the reason why even that was being discussed is because of [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5054.02s)]
*  Interest-based politics. I mean we put out an ad with a cuss word in it and the amount of feedback that we got [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5060.46s)]
*  was insane and [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5066.0599999999995s)]
*  From people within the party from people in the party and like Republicans are and it's like we we have to [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5068.14s)]
*  We have to respond to that obviously we take that stuff seriously we reach out to the people that have concerns [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5075.5s)]
*  That takes time from us. They're getting calls from people like Jen people like myself [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5081.3s)]
*  I [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5085.32s)]
*  Apologizing for this so that we're keeping our coalition together [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5087.32s)]
*  Meanwhile Trump is putting these Republicans and the worst possible [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5090.0s)]
*  Political or what would seem to be and they support it because they're at the end of the day [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5093.28s)]
*  they understand that it weakens Trump and [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5097.8s)]
*  You know, this may sound like a shot across the bow, but it should be Democrats are eating our own to a very high degree [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5100.72s)]
*  And until that stops [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5107.639999999999s)]
*  we're not gonna be able to address a lot of the things that just need to be said and like for the [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5109.24s)]
*  Masculinity piece of it men don't like people that apologize [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5114.2s)]
*  I don't know what age bracket but it's called like standing on business [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5117.12s)]
*  If you say something you mean it Trump does not apologize if he says something he means it and his party stands behind him [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5120.36s)]
*  And they don't make him backtrack it and that type of [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5126.0s)]
*  Infrastructure doesn't exist. We're also getting creamed online [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5130.28s)]
*  I think one of the things about how even in the states that we're not playing in it bleeds over the Republicans have a well-tuned [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5132.92s)]
*  Well oiled well invested echo chamber that exists beyond where they're campaigning and it's online [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5141.28s)]
*  It reverberates through tik-tok. It reverberates through the culture. There is a cultural [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5148.400000000001s)]
*  Dynamic that's at play in politics today where it is converging like we've never seen we're losing the culture war and we're losing the culture [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5154.16s)]
*  War and whatever it is woke whatever words you want to use [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5160.88s)]
*  I'm not you know, I leave that to anybody to define on whatever value [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5164.64s)]
*  But we are not aligned on where we can be within that because there's always an opportunity [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5168.4s)]
*  it may be very different for you in your state where you are, but at the end of the day, we're all Democrats and [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5174.16s)]
*  I think that people are very [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5179.08s)]
*  Advantages to throw someone else under the bus a fellow Democrat if it means that they can be rise above it in their own state [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5181.24s)]
*  But we're missing the sort of force for the trees and I think we have to be better about that [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5187.599999999999s)]
*  Jen, this is the third campaign in a row where Trump has not [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5191.84s)]
*  Invested what appears to be not invested significant money into a traditional field [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5196.400000000001s)]
*  organization and yet still gotten incredibly high turnout you guys invested a ton of money and time in the field [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5202.0s)]
*  particularly in this election [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5209.72s)]
*  Is there and that obviously bore fruit? So I'm not suggesting it didn't but is there anything you take from this? [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5211.84s)]
*  That makes you question how we have traditionally done field in the Democratic Party in terms of efficiency or efficacy [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5218.88s)]
*  Well, I know that I know this is a loaded question for you. Yeah [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5226.120000000001s)]
*  So first of all, I don't I think against national headwinds. We would not have come as close and I will stipulate that without [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5232.64s)]
*  Organizing and I [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5241.360000000001s)]
*  think that part of what we [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5243.96s)]
*  have to do as [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5247.0s)]
*  Democrats and on our side is you know do the work of having the conversations and reaching people [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5249.72s)]
*  I just think that is a part of our party and a part of the people lower propensity that we are trying to reach that [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5255.32s)]
*  We can reach effectively through programs at the same time [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5260.66s)]
*  I think that and I think Republicans generally have not had that same challenge because for the most part [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5264.58s)]
*  There are folks have kind of turned out pretty consistently. I think Trump again is an anomaly [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5271.639999999999s)]
*  So I would be careful to put [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5276.88s)]
*  Tactics [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5278.96s)]
*  To him that could work for someone else because I'm not sure on his side that that's possible [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5280.16s)]
*  But what is true and what I do think we need the answer to is how do we reach people? [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5285.400000000001s)]
*  In ways that isn't just about traditional field and we worked very hard at this [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5291.12s)]
*  But I'm not sure we sort of solved all of it, you know, there's the door knocking. There's the phone calls [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5297.08s)]
*  There's the texting there's a ways to reach people. We do that effectively. We know how to do it [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5301.68s)]
*  We have volunteers like we had [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5306.2s)]
*  Extraordinary people that came from all over that were part of the battleground states that did the work did the trainings [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5308.96s)]
*  We did contrast at the doors and on the calls [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5315.0s)]
*  You don't typically do that [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5318.6s)]
*  Our folks were able to handle all of that and it was a testament to the overall [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5319.8s)]
*  Organization and the organization could scale as we had just growing support, which is exactly what you want to see [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5324.12s)]
*  We spent a lot of time [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5330.04s)]
*  Even earlier in the year when President Biden was at the top of the ticket [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5332.16s)]
*  Working on and I hate fucking terms for fields. So I can like really you invented most of them [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5336.28s)]
*  I just it's like all organizing or field I still say field but anyway, whatever relational the bottom line is we know [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5342.68s)]
*  Especially in this environment that we're talking about where people are tuned out to politics. They want to stay away from the chaos of Trump [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5349.72s)]
*  they [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5355.2s)]
*  Don't trust institutions. They don't trust parties. How do you reach them? You reach them by people? [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5356.72s)]
*  They trust in their own lives [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5361.9s)]
*  So so much of what we were trying to do was to get to the young people [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5362.94s)]
*  not just to talk to them but to give them the tools and [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5367.299999999999s)]
*  Empower them to speak to other people in their lives. And I think that we made some progress here [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5371.42s)]
*  I think you know, there's lots of [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5377.099999999999s)]
*  Technical things that help us do that [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5379.9s)]
*  But at the end of the day [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5381.46s)]
*  There is no doubt that Donald Trump figured out how to do that and did that to young people young men in a way that [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5382.62s)]
*  He you know created some of this coolness [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5389.58s)]
*  To folks and and and most of the people that wouldn't be harmed [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5393.38s)]
*  You know are the ones that felt like that he was cool and they would respond in the podcast and so on [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5397.9800000000005s)]
*  Young men in particular. Yeah young white men in particular too, but this isn't to say [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5404.42s)]
*  This is all just about young white men from a how you reach people. I actually think you know, we worked a lot on [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5411.34s)]
*  Sharing content we worked on trying to talk not just to our own people, right? [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5418.1s)]
*  Which is one of the problems and the limitations of platforms that you're just speaking to the chorus [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5422.58s)]
*  It's it's part of the challenge [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5427.38s)]
*  How do we try to get people to then be inspired to speak to people in their own lives and to do it in a way? [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5429.02s)]
*  That is not political and not partisan and I think we had some hits and misses but we've got to solve this because [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5435.26s)]
*  you cannot [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5440.9800000000005s)]
*  Put enough money into social media and digital [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5442.62s)]
*  advertising and paid programming [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5445.98s)]
*  To have the impact that organic reach has when people are empowered to speak in their own lives and are willing to take that [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5448.0599999999995s)]
*  On and we saw that and we saw our people do it [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5455.54s)]
*  It just wasn't getting far enough and it wasn't actually infiltrating at the level that we've been talking about [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5458.92s)]
*  So there are systemic issues here. There is also just elements that [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5463.66s)]
*  You know, we just got to figure out from a campaign standpoint like it's easy to do door knock [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5468.54s)]
*  It's not well door knocking is hard [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5473.12s)]
*  but when you know how to track it and you know how to be accountable to it like there are [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5474.66s)]
*  structural challenges that we have to work on for [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5479.0599999999995s)]
*  Sharing content that that has as much power as it does doing a door knock [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5482.74s)]
*  And so there's things that we we really tried to implement this time [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5487.219999999999s)]
*  But I think we still have work to do to understand and there are groups that do this do this [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5490.299999999999s)]
*  Well, you do not have to just be part of [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5493.82s)]
*  The political campaign environment we have to pull ideas from everywhere because at its essence [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5496.42s)]
*  It is figuring out how you reach someone that doesn't really want to be reached about topics [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5501.0s)]
*  Maybe that they don't know that they really want to engage on and that they retain it and carry it forward to then be willing [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5506.099999999999s)]
*  To take an action and that really is going to require [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5512.42s)]
*  more community more [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5515.299999999999s)]
*  Inputs from different parts of your life to ultimately get people to do that. Okay, I have tortured you guys probably long enough [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5518.299999999999s)]
*  But before we go, I just want to ask is there anything else any final lessons [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5525.0199999999995s)]
*  Or thoughts any of you want to offer about what happened and what comes next? Can I do one? Of course, okay [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5530.179999999999s)]
*  so we lost and that really sucks and we came really close and obviously [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5536.74s)]
*  we believe that we could pull this off and [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5542.98s)]
*  That is something we all have to live with and we'll have to live with for the next four years [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5546.78s)]
*  But that does not mean that the people that did the work on the campaign as volunteers in these states [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5551.26s)]
*  that that work didn't matter it was so important and I I [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5557.9400000000005s)]
*  If I spend the rest of my life just doing this like I hope people hear especially people that listen to your [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5563.34s)]
*  Podcasts in your audience that there is so much [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5571.5s)]
*  Power in being involved in a campaign like this and and doing a job that you can believe in every day and going to talk [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5575.58s)]
*  To regular people and make your case for why you care about something and why you hope they care about it, too [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5582.860000000001s)]
*  That even though we didn't get it over the finish finish line [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5588.7s)]
*  We got it closer because of those volunteers and because of those young staff that moved to Wilmington [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5591.62s)]
*  That moved to all these places in the country that they didn't have to and during kovat. It was really hard [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5596.7s)]
*  I think our industry a campaign industry, you know [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5602.78s)]
*  We sort of lost some of the pipeline of people that did this cycle after cycle [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5606.0199999999995s)]
*  I am only here today because I started a long time ago doing campaigns and I have stayed with them for a long time [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5609.46s)]
*  But I just hope people don't look at what happened and think well what I did didn't matter or the campaign didn't matter or the vice [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5615.179999999999s)]
*  President wasn't exceptional because she was and because what they did did matter and that does not also mean that you have to keep fighting [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5621.98s)]
*  Every day we are in a long haul right now and we're gonna have to [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5628.7s)]
*  Take care of ourselves and fight in the way we can fight when the fighting needs to be done [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5632.26s)]
*  but I just like the people that stood with us on this campaign are the ones that are gonna get us through this next hurdle and [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5636.78s)]
*  They're the ones that we're all gonna follow behind because they are that good and that exceptional and have learned so much and are the future [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5643.0199999999995s)]
*  And I just want to make sure that every single person even if you did one text or one phone call [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5650.139999999999s)]
*  You know that what you did really mattered and made a difference here even when the ultimate result wasn't what we had hoped for [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5656.46s)]
*  That seems like a great place to end in that's also true for the four of you who did incredible work under impossible circumstances [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5662.7s)]
*  None of you had to do this and you did it because it was important. And so I'm very grateful to you [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZOpWp02WVs&t=5668.74s)]
