Video Description: White smoke! Cardinal Robert Prevost, an American-born prelate with a surprisingly political Twitter history, dons the papal vestments as Pope Leo XIV. Trump announces a trade deal with the United Kingdom and swaps out two key nominees for MAGA (and MAHA) favorites: tree-loving influencer Casey Means for Surgeon General, and Fox News’s Jeanine Pirro for US Attorney for DC. Senate Democrats clash with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel over the constitutional right to due process. And President Joe Biden attempts to rehabilitate his reputation, going on The View to talk about why he believes he would've won the 2024 election. Jon and Dan discuss MAGA's reaction to our new, possibly woke pope, House Republicans' internal debate over Medicaid cuts, and why Democrats should be honest about Biden's decline. Then, Jon talks to Leah Litman, co-host of Strict Scrutiny, about the Trump administration's attacks on the judicial system and her new book Lawless: How the Supreme Court Runs on Conservative Grievance, Fringe Theories, and Bad Vibes.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

*  You'll also hear my interview with our pal [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=49.599999999999994s)]
*  Leah Lippman strict scrutiny co-host and new author of the book lawless which comes out next week [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=51.58s)]
*  We'll talk about that and all the latest legal news [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=58.44s)]
*  But let's start with the big news of the day. We got a woke Pope from the south side of Chicago a [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=61.56s)]
*  Warm Barack Obama's heart look at that on Thursday. It's it's Reverend, Wright. No, I'm just kidding [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=68.68s)]
*  That's who's the one person the studio laughing at that joke [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=76.44s)]
*  Re-evaluate [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=80.44s)]
*  Obviously Obama bro. Yes, you have to be a 40 plus Obama bro to get that joke on Thursday [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=82.44s)]
*  Cardinal Robert Prevost became Pope Leo the 14th the first American Pope [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=88.32s)]
*  Also a citizen of Peru where he served for two decades first as a missionary and ultimately a bishop most importantly [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=93.84s)]
*  He seems to be a poster a poster who has retweeted criticism about JD Vance Trump's immigration policy and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=101.0s)]
*  Republican inaction on gun violence among other things [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  Dan, what do you think of our new pontiff? I think if we're gonna get a pope [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=111.84s)]
*  We should have a American woke Pope from Chicago. That seems great. Especially one who hates JD Vance [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=115.56s)]
*  I say woke Pope because it sounds good, but it is more of a he had more of a never Trump ballwork Pope [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=120.68s)]
*  Yes, I that's the I just saw that was Tommy and love its joke earlier. He's a bulwark Pope a lot of people posting that [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  It's so weird they claim that they I saw love it to the T for trademark [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=133.8s)]
*  I mean like you're judging wokeness on a Pope scale [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=140.60000000000002s)]
*  Right, though, like the Pope is gonna have a series of views that we do not love on abortion [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=144.60000000000002s)]
*  LGBTQ rights all those things but the fact that he has leaned so hard in and very recently into a [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=151.24s)]
*  Humane view of immigration how we treat migrants that is an opposite direct opposition to how Trump is doing it seems very positive for what is [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  True, like obviously a major political issue in this country, but a global issue [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=166.44s)]
*  for the next generation and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=171.07999999999998s)]
*  Also, just enjoyable that the MAGA right is going bananas about this. They're so upset [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=173.68s)]
*  They're so angry like you because we talked this morning when we first before we saw that the tweets [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=178.72s)]
*  We're like when is Trump gonna take credit for an American Pope and now his base is freaking out about the woke Pope [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=184.23999999999998s)]
*  It's so funny. I'll just I'll speak as the resident Catholic here [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  You know, I grew up in the Catholic Church is like pretty conservative, right? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  Just with on a lot of issues that we probably care about though [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=197.89999999999998s)]
*  You know on immigration on poverty or more in peace and the death penalty. It's always been more progressive than not [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=202.28s)]
*  And I do think that in the Francis era and especially since Francis appointed like I think 80% of the Cardinals that voted [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=209.94s)]
*  Those the leaders of the Catholic Church are now leaning into [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=219.05999999999997s)]
*  sort of the more progressive positions on issues that they've always had or at least the church has mostly always had but on [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=222.54s)]
*  on issues of sexual orientation gender identity abortion [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=230.38s)]
*  Church is still pretty conservative though. Even Francis, you know [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=234.73999999999998s)]
*  He made some little headway on that but it is a generally traditionalist conservative institution [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  So I think this is it's very good news as someone who really wants to see the church continue in the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  Direction that Francis was was pushing the church and as someone who likes to pick a Twitter fight with JD Vance [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=249.56s)]
*  You probably feel some affinity with this Pope the piece that the Pope the now Pope shared [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=254.88s)]
*  It was about you know, JD Vance's what was it called? Ordo? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=260.28s)]
*  Adoramus whatever that thing it basically says this this theory that he fucking made up that he [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=265.1s)]
*  That he didn't make it up [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=270.98s)]
*  But it's not really the theory that's not really official policy of the Catholic Church that you're supposed to love [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=272.98s)]
*  Love the people around you and then as they you go out and concentric circles, you don't have to care that much about other people [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=278.74s)]
*  So it's sort of that's that's the gist. Yes seems everyone contrary to some parts of the golden roll [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=285.34000000000003s)]
*  Piece that the Pope shared says it ought to be clear that Catholics cannot support a rhetoric that demonizes immigrants is dangerously criminal simply [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=291.18s)]
*  Because they have crossed the border in search of a better life [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=297.82s)]
*  It ought to be clear that Catholics cannot celebrate aggressive deportation enforcement a spectacle [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=299.94s)]
*  It ought to be clear that Catholics cannot accept a theory of love that pats itself on the back for putting some of the poorest [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=304.6s)]
*  Among us farthest from our concern and charity [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=309.90000000000003s)]
*  Love that of that his last tweet his last retweet was after the Trump bukele meeting [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=312.90000000000003s)]
*  And it said do you not see the suffering is your conscious not disturbed? How can you stay quiet? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=319.29999999999995s)]
*  I mean, you know, we love our American Pope or Chicago Pope [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=323.62s)]
*  Yeah, but and and Steve Bannon apparently called this like last week [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=329.21999999999997s)]
*  he was like, I'm worried that they're gonna go with that they could go with Cardinal Prevost because [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=333.58s)]
*  He would be the most progressive pick. Huh? Interesting now. He's not the most progressive pick, but that's what Bannon said [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=338.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, and Laura Loomer is just yelling about a woke Marxist Pope [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=343.91999999999996s)]
*  I mean if if Laura Loomer loomers the Pope then she is all powerful her woke Marxist Pope thing [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=346.8s)]
*  Of course has gone viral and I just retweeted this but someone someone posted [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=352.56s)]
*  Sung to the tune of pink pony club and now I can't get it out of my head [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=357.0s)]
*  You're all singing it now is pink club and [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=364.96000000000004s)]
*  All right [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=369.2s)]
*  Even though America has given the world a new pope [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=370.56s)]
*  We must get back to talking about our worst export Donald Trump and his global trade war [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=372.96000000000004s)]
*  Fed chair Jerome Powell announced this week that the central bank won't be cutting interest rates just yet and said that Trump's tariffs will likely [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=377.6s)]
*  Lead to higher prices and unemployment [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=383.92s)]
*  Potentially the stagflation scenario. That's basically the worst case for the economy right now [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=387.24s)]
*  but clearly [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=391.96000000000004s)]
*  Powell hasn't read the art of the deal lately because on Thursday morning Trump announced a trade deal of sorts with the UK [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=393.68s)]
*  There will still be a 10% tax on everything we buy that's made in the UK except for cars like Rolls Royces and Bentleys [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=400.28000000000003s)]
*  And I guess they're gonna drop tariffs on some US exports. So just amazing work. Mr. Trump. You've done it again [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=408.04s)]
*  Trump announced the deal in the oval followed by the ritual fluffing from his staff. Let's listen [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=415.84000000000003s)]
*  This was the president's deal and people think oh, that's not the way it works [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=420.88s)]
*  If you got to sit next to him, I have the best deal maker to my left [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=424.68s)]
*  He's the closer he gets deals done that we could never get done because he understands business [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=428.96000000000004s)]
*  He understands deals. We started at 10% and we ended at 10% and the market for America is better [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=435.28000000000003s)]
*  And this is a perfect example of why Donald Trump produced liberation debt [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=442.54s)]
*  This would have taken Jamison and I three years maybe and instead we got it done in 45 days [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=447.8s)]
*  Certainly because we work for Donald Trump [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=455.68s)]
*  Howard Lutnick never fails to deliver. Let me tell you what a Commerce Secretary. What are you making a big deal Dan? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=458.8s)]
*  well, I hate to [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=465.52000000000004s)]
*  Disagree with mr. Lutnick here, but [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=469.04s)]
*  They did not get this done in three weeks. This deal has been under some form of discussion since Trump was president the first time [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=471.88s)]
*  It's not particularly related to liberation day. It's not a deal. It's at best a framework of a deal [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=478.88s)]
*  It's maybe a to borrow our first from Trump concept of a deal like we have some outlines. We don't know [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=484.98s)]
*  When it's going into effect, nothing's been signed but the the things to know here are [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=491.58000000000004s)]
*  Trump's completely ass backward asinine [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=497.86s)]
*  Understanding of global trade suggests that if you have a trade that the United States of the trade deficit with that country [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=501.46000000000004s)]
*  Then we are losing somehow. We have a trade surplus with the UK [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=506.3s)]
*  We are winning in this scenario [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=511.04s)]
*  So it's like what this is not like if theoretically there's more we can open up [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=513.04s)]
*  Like one of the things in here is they're raising the quota on US beef going to the UK. That's fine [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=519.08s)]
*  That's like a totally fine normal thing [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=524.32s)]
*  This is not going to change very much at all [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=525.96s)]
*  The fact that it's the UK is very telling because as I mentioned, it's a deal that's been worked on for years [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=528.5600000000001s)]
*  It's also our closest ally with a special relationship with a very meager trading trading relationships [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=533.1s)]
*  So it's a pretty easy deal to get done if you're looking to show some victory and [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=538.24s)]
*  Let Nick is celebrating that the 10% tariffs are on there what he's doing [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=543.08s)]
*  He's celebrating the continued 10% tax on a bit that American people will pay on goods coming from the UK [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=546.48s)]
*  unless you buy Rolls Royce if you buy one of the [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=552.32s)]
*  100,000 took it from 25 to yeah, we took it from 25 to 10 on Rolls Royce [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=556.0s)]
*  But you're right the first hundred thousand that come into the United States. There's nothing [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=560.0s)]
*  Yeah, the first hundred thousand Rolls Royce's and other British manufactured cars will [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=563.4s)]
*  Not face that tariff Bentley's Range Rovers minis. I think that's I think that's everyone Aston Martin Aston Martin Aston Martin [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=568.6s)]
*  You're right. Yeah, all things all things that learn from James Bond [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=576.5600000000001s)]
*  US tariff rates because of this quote-unquote deal fell point oh six percent [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=581.08s)]
*  Yeah, so it's not much of a deal but NBC's the embassy headline on this is amazing [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=587.4s)]
*  Trump gives break to Rolls Royce cars, but threatens more tariffs on Mattel toys [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=593.0s)]
*  And honestly the pieces even worse than the headline because there's a quote from Trump about the rolls Rolls Royce [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=599.24s)]
*  He goes we took it from 25 to 10 on Rolls Royce because Rolls Royce is not gonna be built here [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=605.12s)]
*  I wouldn't even ask them to do that. It's a very special car and then [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=610.0s)]
*  The CEO of Mattel had said that he's going to move some production out of China into other countries [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=615.48s)]
*  But not the US and Trump said that's okay. Let him go [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=621.04s)]
*  We'll put a hundred percent tariff on his toys, and he won't sell one toy in the United States [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=624.76s)]
*  Cool [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=630.84s)]
*  I would never ask the I wouldn't ask Rolls Royce to build their cars anywhere [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=633.04s)]
*  But the UK and please please sell as many as you want, but fucking Mattel toys no more. We're done trade embargo on Mattel toys [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=637.68s)]
*  I mean it's this also like fits in with the news that Trump proposed to Mike Johnson a loan program for newborn babies [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=645.84s)]
*  Assumedly to offset the cost of tariffs from because 99% of strollers car seats baby toys everything or come from China [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=654.84s)]
*  So we're gonna put babies in debt to cover the tariffs [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=662.4s)]
*  You have to give the baby back. What's how does this work? Yeah? I'm not sure [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=666.4399999999999s)]
*  The baby themselves might be the collateral here. I don't know [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=670.84s)]
*  It feels I mean obviously they're doing this because they want to show momentum big deal, you know [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=675.12s)]
*  Tommy was pointing out that like Fox News all day even though the biggest story is [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=680.24s)]
*  the Pope all day was talking about the UK trade deal because you can tell if they want they want to make this a big [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=684.84s)]
*  Deal and you know the markets reacted positively as they have been the last week or so because I think markets are hoping that we're sort of [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=690.2s)]
*  inching towards some kind of resolution here. I don't know if that really works [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=697.72s)]
*  as a political strategy or or really a [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=702.76s)]
*  Trade strategy, but no I don't think it works [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=705.64s)]
*  It doesn't work as a trade strategy doesn't work as a market strategy like the markets went up this morning [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=708.16s)]
*  but it's not because of [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=712.24s)]
*  This deal it's because the prospect that we're gonna have negotiations with China next week. That's what people care about [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=714.8s)]
*  Our relationship our political relationship with the UK is quote-unquote special and important and historic our trade relationship with the UK is fairly minimal compared to [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=721.16s)]
*  Some of the other like Canada Mexico China the places that are most affected by this [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=728.92s)]
*  And people it's all reality like reality sits in when it comes to the economy [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=732.92s)]
*  You can't yeah, you can't fake it people are going to see prices go up. They're going to see empty shelves [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=736.12s)]
*  Just ask Joe Biden [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=741.0s)]
*  That's right. Exactly the markets could possibly go up on a deal here or there [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=742.52s)]
*  But what they're really supposed to do is project medium and long term [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=746.52s)]
*  the medium and long-term state of the economy and if that [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=751.4799999999999s)]
*  If the economy performs as Jerome Powell thinks it might then that's going to affect the market too [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=754.36s)]
*  No matter how many deals Trump announces between now and then uh, let's talk about China the first cargo ships with goods subject to trump's [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=759.0799999999999s)]
*  145 percent tariffs are now arriving here on the west coast [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=765.88s)]
*  Bloomberg had a fascinating breakdown of one container ship that's carrying [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=770.36s)]
*  564 million dollars worth of products from China that will cost the Americans who bought them [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=774.66s)]
*  417 million dollars in tariff payments. I'm not a great business guy, but that seems like it's gonna be difficult to turn a profit [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=782.4200000000001s)]
*  Unless you raise prices true [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=791.24s)]
*  Uh the port the port of los angeles is expecting a 35 drop in volume this week and that's just one port [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=793.32s)]
*  Um trump was asked about all this at the oval event on thursday with this big uk deal. Uh, let's listen [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=800.6s)]
*  Courts here in the us [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=806.12s)]
*  The traffic has really slowed and now thousands of dock workers and truck drivers are worried about their jobs [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=808.12s)]
*  Is that that means we lose less money? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=814.6s)]
*  You know when I see that that means we lose less money. So when you say it's slowed down [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=816.76s)]
*  That's that's a good thing not a bad thing. It's a good thing dan [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=821.32s)]
*  It's a good thing [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=823.88s)]
*  to have [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=825.1600000000001s)]
*  The shipping of goods in global trade slow down so that people can't get the goods they need and have to pay more [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=826.2800000000001s)]
*  For the ones that are left [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=833.08s)]
*  And that the people who work at the docks and drive the trucks and the stores to sell goods lose their jobs [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=835.24s)]
*  That's that's a good thing. That is a good thing [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=841.08s)]
*  I mean he really is a walking talking argument for making econ a [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=843.4000000000001s)]
*  Required course in american high school [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=849.16s)]
*  It's like he just the fundamentals of it [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=851.9599999999999s)]
*  He does not like if he had gone to and paid attention to the first [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=853.8s)]
*  Three weeks if econ 101 at any university in america, we would not be in this problem. Well, that's his excuse [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=858.4399999999999s)]
*  What's the excuse of all the fucking people that work in his administration? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=863.4799999999999s)]
*  Because they do what he wants. Yeah, like scott fucking beset knows better [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=868.12s)]
*  He is trying to work of course he wrote a thousand things before the election [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=872.76s)]
*  Trying to rationalize terrorists, but you know, whatever his queered quote was about how the tariff gun always stays in the drawer [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=877.88s)]
*  Yeah [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=883.08s)]
*  So he is trying to work around the insanity and ignorance of his boss and so many other people [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=883.72s)]
*  Yes, I mean he's he's going to end up working somewhere with gary cone one day [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=888.9200000000001s)]
*  But like that's I mean that's where and the rest of these people are they do they do like they view their job as to [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=892.44s)]
*  Serve as to do what trump wants regardless of how stupid that is apparently besant is meeting in switzerland with [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=898.28s)]
*  Uh the the chinese [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=905.64s)]
*  uh this weekend [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=908.2s)]
*  To maybe talk about [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=910.36s)]
*  I don't know first steps on a deal first steps on negotiations about a deal [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=912.12s)]
*  I don't know how this ends with china because I don't you know trump doesn't want [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=916.44s)]
*  To make it to have it seem at all like he is giving into china [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=920.6s)]
*  But he needs to give into china. So [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=924.76s)]
*  This is what I feel like this is what this whole switzerland thing is about. Yeah, I mean [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=927.48s)]
*  The chinese are suffering economically from the tariffs like there are projections that they'll lose 60 million chinese will lose their jobs [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=932.28s)]
*  The forecasts on economic growth are being revised down like we are we buy their stuff more than anyone else in the world if they [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=939.48s)]
*  Can't sell it to us that like those ships [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=944.44s)]
*  Those empty ships are bad for them, but the problem with the trade war with china is [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=948.36s)]
*  They face no political pressure. There is no there she's not sitting around, uh checking dave wasserman's [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=953.32s)]
*  Uh twitter feed to see how things are looking at the 2026 midterms and he doesn't have to worry about [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=959.16s)]
*  congress he can just as they are doing just enact a stimulus plan to [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=964.66s)]
*  Offset the economic damage the short-term economic damage of the tariffs. So [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=970.12s)]
*  Like trump trump will face [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=975.24s)]
*  political pressure in this country [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=977.3s)]
*  Uh in adverse effects that she will never face even if his economy even if their economy ends up suffering more [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=979.64s)]
*  In the short term than our stuff [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=986.0400000000001s)]
*  Let's check in on the other part of trump's economic plan a big beautiful bill filled with tax cuts and maybe cuts to medicaid [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=987.64s)]
*  And other programs, but we still don't know for sure because republicans can't seem to agree on anything [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=993.72s)]
*  The latest is that they're now looking at four trillion dollars in tax cuts and 1.5 trillion dollars in spending cuts [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=998.9200000000001s)]
*  It was originally 4.5 and 2 [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1006.2s)]
*  And the spending cuts are theoretically supposed to include 880 billion dollars in cuts to medicaid [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1009.4s)]
*  But house republicans who will face competitive races in 2026 are nervous about cutting medicaid as they should be [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1015.0s)]
*  Reportedly, so was the white house. So now they're trying to find ways to cut medicaid [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1022.58s)]
*  Without really cutting medicaid, which is quite a trick to pull off [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1027.3200000000002s)]
*  One idea that's still floating around [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1031.3200000000002s)]
*  capping the amount the federal government spends on each medicaid recipient [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1033.96s)]
*  Which would lead to a lot of people losing their health insurance because [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1039.08s)]
*  The cap wouldn't account for rising health care costs [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1042.44s)]
*  And so when health care costs go up people would just not be able to afford them or the states wouldn't be able to pay more [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1045.56s)]
*  The more moderate republicans don't like this either, but the hardline republicans refuse to vote for a bill that doesn't find [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1052.68s)]
*  1.5 trillion dollars in cuts somewhere. So here we are [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1060.18s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1065.4s)]
*  Can you think of a solution here that gets all the house republicans on board? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1066.28s)]
*  If you were to take these people at their word and you probably shouldn't frankly most of them are liars and have [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1069.6399999999999s)]
*  No understanding at all of how governmental fiscal policy works [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1076.68s)]
*  But if you took them at their word if you just did that as a thought exercise, nothing can pass [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1079.08s)]
*  Because you have a group of people who say they will not pass a bill that cuts medicaid above a certain level [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1083.56s)]
*  You have a bunch of different group of people who will not pass a bill [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1089.0s)]
*  Unless it cuts medicaid below a certain level like the red lines are crossing left and right [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1091.8s)]
*  So if you took them at their word, they cannot get it done [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1095.0s)]
*  Will they find some way to get it done? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1099.48s)]
*  maybe [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1101.8s)]
*  I mean they have done everything trump's asked them to do thus far like we've democrats have been quite skeptical that they would pass this [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1102.84s)]
*  budget resolution [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1107.72s)]
*  And they did [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1109.0s)]
*  You know, I mentioned this on the show [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1110.44s)]
*  recently [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1112.52s)]
*  last week two weeks six months ago, who knows but [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1113.8s)]
*  You know one thing they could do is just they could punt they could extend the tax cuts for a year or two [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1116.92s)]
*  Unpaid for or with some [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1123.72s)]
*  Non-medicaid spending cuts where you're just sort of paying a toll and say because of the economic uncertainty of the tariffs [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1125.78s)]
*  We the last thing we want to do is risk [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1131.3999999999999s)]
*  Raising taxes on every american [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1133.8s)]
*  So we're gonna do this and come back now the downside to them is they could very much lose the house in the interim [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1135.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and then they're for there then they're forced into a negotiate trump is forced into a negotiation [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1140.36s)]
*  With democrats, but they can't let taxes go up on every american [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1144.94s)]
*  Like that is just something they absolutely cannot do and if they cannot figure the cuts out in the interim [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1148.62s)]
*  That i'm not sure what other option there is i'm trying to think of how trump would explain that one because he's not going to be [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1153.1s)]
*  Like oh we lost I guess he'd just be like, uh, he'd just say well I wanted all this but uh, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1158.1399999999999s)]
*  You know what democrats are gonna if we don't pass something democrats are gonna let the taxes go up and democrats want your taxes to go [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1163.4199999999998s)]
*  Up, so we're gonna save the day and make sure the taxes don't go up. I guess that would be he's already started [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1168.86s)]
*  He's already there's we don't have to have this conversation today [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1173.1000000000001s)]
*  But there's a longer conversation about democratic strategy here and what they should be doing that they may not yet be doing [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1175.74s)]
*  but he's already started the [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1180.7s)]
*  Democrats want your taxes to go up because we're all opposing this bill [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1182.76s)]
*  Um, and so like it's not it's it's an inelegant solution for the republicans for sure [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1186.3s)]
*  But it is one if they cannot square the circle on these cuts [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1191.5800000000002s)]
*  Someone has to give the moderates have to give or the conservatives have to give and then you have a whole set of different problems [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1196.38s)]
*  With the senate, um and getting to your 50 votes there [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1201.02s)]
*  If they can't do that, they're gonna have to do something and that could be a that could be a punt [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1205.5s)]
*  Reuters reported on thursday that trump is [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1209.1s)]
*  Privately pushing johnson to create a new higher tax bracket for people making over 2.5 million dollars [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1211.8s)]
*  Uh enclosing the so-called carried interest loophole as ways of paying for tax cuts to everyone else [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1219.02s)]
*  Uh, this was like, you know higher taxes for the rich were on the table then they were off the table [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1225.6599999999999s)]
*  Steve bannon wanted them and some of the mega populist types and then [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1231.4199999999998s)]
*  The more establishment mega types were like no, that's crazy. We love tax cuts for rich people. That's why we came to congress [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1236.1399999999999s)]
*  um [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1242.06s)]
*  Or do you think this flies? Do you think they can do a a 2.5 million dollar tax bracket? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1243.26s)]
*  I also don't know how much [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1248.9399999999998s)]
*  It's 2.5 million dollars in income. So it's like, you know, really rich people [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1250.62s)]
*  Like multimillionaires and billionaires, they probably have a lot of money that they're not getting an income [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1255.4199999999998s)]
*  So I don't even know how much that saves them. But [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1259.74s)]
*  Yeah, the devil is in the details here for sure [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1262.2199999999998s)]
*  They would it would certainly get them some savings with reduced pressure on the cut side of it [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1264.86s)]
*  But it's impossible. It's almost impossible to imagine this passing right the every time this keeps getting floated [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1269.58s)]
*  And republicans keep shooting this down from like republicans who rarely disagree with trump shoot this idea down because the idea of [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1275.82s)]
*  taxing rich people is [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1282.9399999999998s)]
*  impossible than the fathom and just even if you're being generous about this, they're [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1285.1s)]
*  their [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1289.1799999999998s)]
*  Long-held doctrinaire republican view that you never raise taxes [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1290.2199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, right. That's the that's the that's the reagan rule the one that uh, george w hw bush violated [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1294.4599999999998s)]
*  and um lost [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1300.78s)]
*  You know was primaried because of it and lost reelection. So I can't imagine doing it now carried interest loophole. You could probably find [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1302.78s)]
*  some more support for but [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1309.26s)]
*  once trump's new vc buddies [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1311.98s)]
*  Hear about this they're gonna blow up the white house and it's gonna come to an end [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1314.8600000000001s)]
*  Like I just don't think either of these are happening [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1319.02s)]
*  Someone asked a reporter asked trump about this last week or whenever and he was like, oh we can't let taxes go up [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1320.6200000000001s)]
*  Even on the rich. It's not we're we're not gonna do that. That's too much. And then now he's you know, jake sherman's like [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1326.3s)]
*  Oh, he called mike johnson was like, let's do it [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1330.6200000000001s)]
*  And now mike johnson's entertaining it but that probably doesn't mean much either [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1333.26s)]
*  But he shot it mike johnson shot it down the last time too. So I just last time now he's concerned [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1336.22s)]
*  I don't know who the fuck knows but this I think it just goes to show that they the math is so hard here for them [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1340.7s)]
*  Yeah [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1346.38s)]
*  um [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1346.8600000000001s)]
*  one thing that's important is [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1347.9s)]
*  We know in the past almost every single time maybe every time that I can remember when there is [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1350.3s)]
*  sort of a battle between the hardline republicans and the [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1356.22s)]
*  More moderate republicans who are in competitive races the moderate republicans always fold [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1360.22s)]
*  the hardliners win the day [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1366.14s)]
*  And so I think that if people [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1368.14s)]
*  And I know people have been going to town halls holding town halls of their own [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1371.26s)]
*  Democratic members have been going to republican districts who refuse to hold town halls and hold them there [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1374.76s)]
*  continue putting pressure on [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1381.0200000000002s)]
*  the republicans in districts that are going to face competitive races in 2026 because [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1383.66s)]
*  That pressure needs to be sustained and we need to be loud because they need to [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1388.38s)]
*  fear [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1393.5800000000002s)]
*  What might happen to their job if they? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1394.6200000000001s)]
*  Cut medicaid and so you can go to vote save america.com [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1397.8999999999999s)]
*  To look for places to take action [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1401.8999999999999s)]
*  But I do think in these next couple weeks who knows it could be months [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1403.6599999999999s)]
*  But they're gonna you know these things come together fast [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1407.6599999999999s)]
*  And then suddenly we're looking at a whole bunch of medicaid cuts on the table that we didn't think were going to happen [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1410.3799999999999s)]
*  So I think it's really important for people to keep up the pressure. This is a fight. We can win [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1414.62s)]
*  That's not guaranteed like we don't have the votes to stop it, but it is very akin to [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1419.4199999999998s)]
*  Well, let me put it this way cutting medicaid is way more unpopular [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1424.78s)]
*  Than attempts to repeal the affordable care act or trump's first term [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1429.02s)]
*  You have 80 percent of americans [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1433.34s)]
*  opposing medicaid cuts [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1436.46s)]
*  You know more than 50 percent of republicans 75 percent of independents there is incredibly popular [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1438.3s)]
*  It is ingrained in people's lives [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1443.74s)]
*  It is how many many americans get health care something like 40 percent of births in america are [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1445.8999999999999s)]
*  Paid for by medicaid and so like you can't like yes republicans are craven. Yes, they do terrible things [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1452.38s)]
*  We may not win this fight, but it's one we can win [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1459.98s)]
*  There are a lot of fights that just they're going to do what they're like are the confirmations [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1462.14s)]
*  They're just going to do what trump wants and it's not really going to matter [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1464.78s)]
*  This is one where the politics are such that if we put sufficient political pressure on we could actually stop this [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1467.1s)]
*  Yeah, because I mean you laid out the scenario where this is a win and they still get by which is [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1471.9s)]
*  They just give up on the cuts and they extend the tax cuts and they punt for a year or something [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1477.42s)]
*  But that would be a huge win [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1481.02s)]
*  All right [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1483.58s)]
*  Trump administration is still trying very hard to disappear immigrants to foreign gulags and the courts including trump judges [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1484.06s)]
*  Are still trying very hard to stop them [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1490.86s)]
*  The federal government has a new gulag in mind that's somehow even worse than al salvador's seekhat [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1493.26s)]
*  Detention centers in eastern libya, which is controlled by an african warlord [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1499.1s)]
*  Our own state department calls the conditions in those prisons [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1505.02s)]
*  Life-threatening and warns against traveling to libya because of terrorism kidnapping and armed conflict [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1508.38s)]
*  A federal judge almost immediately blocked the trump administration from doing this. We'll see if they listen [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1514.46s)]
*  the lawyers that brought the case said that [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1520.3s)]
*  This was the plan ice rounded up six asian nationals who were detained in texas [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1523.5s)]
*  And ordered them to sign paperwork agreeing to be sent to libya when they refused [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1529.9s)]
*  They were handcuffed and thrown in solitary confinement [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1536.3s)]
*  Wild shit, uh, there's also another lawyer said that they were trying to [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1539.9s)]
*  potentially [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1544.7s)]
*  send [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1545.9s)]
*  mexican immigrants [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1547.08s)]
*  Detainees to libya which is even more insane because mexico is taking deportees [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1549.34s)]
*  If there are mexican nationals you can send them back to mexico and the mexican government will take them [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1555.82s)]
*  So they're literally just wanting to send people to libya to this fucking hell hole [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1559.74s)]
*  I don't know just because to send it to send a message to send a message to send a message [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1565.0200000000002s)]
*  Meanwhile in a dc courtroom, uh judge bozberg [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1570.0600000000002s)]
*  Challenged the doj's position that they have no authority to bring back the people [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1573.2600000000002s)]
*  They disappear to foreign gulags by pointing out that trump himself said on national tv [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1577.5s)]
*  to terry moran [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1582.94s)]
*  Uh that he could just pick up the phone and ask bukele to release kilmar or brego garcia [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1584.38s)]
*  Needless to say the doj didn't have a good answer to that [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1589.42s)]
*  Uh, neither did homeland security secretary christine ohm or fbi director cash patelle when they were grilled about due process and deportations [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1592.46s)]
*  During their testimony on capitol hill this week. Let's listen [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1600.06s)]
*  You believe that you have the right to detain or deport a legal permanent resident [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=1603.34s)]

*  as [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2360.76s)]
*  A she's a very big figure in the wellness community [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2361.64s)]
*  Uh very she's a big supporter of arboretum kenny jr for a long time [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2364.28s)]
*  She's quite controversial for a number of reasons. She has a lot of positions on [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2368.68s)]
*  I don't say but there are two reasons she got first one is she has a she has a lot of non-scientific backed positions on [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2373.16s)]
*  disease prevention other things [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2380.44s)]
*  But the other thing is that she's essentially a wellness influencer. She is constantly promoting [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2382.36s)]
*  Supplements vitamins other things with very limited scientific backing [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2388.66s)]
*  But she does it by publishing affiliate links on her social media pages for which she makes money and even more controversially. She's often [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2393.64s)]
*  promoting [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2400.66s)]

*  Kelly means who is also an employee of the department of health and human services [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2408.12s)]
*  And so this is she has none of the credentials [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2412.92s)]
*  Even if you put aside her positions [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2417.2400000000002s)]
*  And and the grift on the wellness side, uh with the supplements and the whatnot [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2419.8s)]
*  She doesn't have any of the credentials that a surgeon general normally has not the clinical experience not the medical experience [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2425.0s)]
*  Not the like uh, like like america's top doctor, uh, like being a doctor being being a practicing physician [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2430.84s)]

*  One of the chapter titles in her book is trust yourself. Not your doctor [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2441.96s)]
*  She said that the birth control [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2447.8s)]
*  Uh, the birth control pill disrespects life because it's quote shutting down the hormones in the female body that create this cyclical life-giving nature of women [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2449.88s)]
*  She likes full moon full moon ceremonies [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2458.52s)]
*  Um, and she has said that talking to trees helped her find [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2461.0s)]
*  true love [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2464.68s)]

*  Because I don't even know what we're supposed to judge biden by here. Yeah, like what was he was he better than debate? [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2695.2400000000002s)]
*  Yes, he was better than he was on the debate stage [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2700.52s)]
*  compared to a [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2703.1400000000003s)]
*  Typical politics an average politician anywhere in america delivering a message was he good [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2705.88s)]
*  No, it was like some there were some good parts. He had some funny lines [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2710.6s)]
*  Most of it was like kind of hard to follow [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2714.52s)]
*  Dr. Biden had to step in on a couple of occasions [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2717.2400000000002s)]
*  Like he survived it I guess like it but it's like to what end like who are we trying to convince here? [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2720.84s)]
*  What's the audience for this? [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2726.68s)]
*  The american people are pretty decided on the question of was joe biden too old and they were decided long before the debate [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2729.56s)]
*  And I don't know that one interview or two interviews or a thousand interviews is going to [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2735.0s)]
*  Nothing's going to change that perspective. Yeah [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2739.64s)]
*  First of all [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2743.72s)]
*  Uh, were you surprised? [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2745.08s)]
*  The camila harris lost no, he wasn't surprised and then he started talking about because they really did the sexist thing hard and [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2747.3199999999997s)]
*  mixed race with the sexist route was they went the sexist route pretty hard and it's like [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2755.64s)]
*  you can [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2760.3599999999997s)]
*  You can posit that there is sexism in the electorate [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2761.64s)]
*  But the the they didn't do the sexist route hard the republicans didn't it's just and then it's like a mixed race woman [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2764.3599999999997s)]
*  Like it's just like I don't know if you paid attention to the campaign or not [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2771.16s)]
*  But anyway, whatever joe biden says aside. I actually think you're right. Like he is he is a former president now [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2773.8799999999997s)]
*  And and that's it right and and if he wants to go out there and talk and defend himself, whatever [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2780.52s)]
*  We're gonna think about the party and think about other democratic officials [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2786.04s)]
*  And other democratic politicians who are going to be asked these questions particularly when these books come out and [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2790.54s)]
*  You know, i've heard some of them some people try to like [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2797.18s)]
*  Yeah, they don't want to answer the question [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2800.38s)]
*  They're worried about they try to allide the question and you've got democratic strategists out there still saying like oh good for the biden's [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2802.14s)]
*  Being out there and they're hiring people to help them and it's like no no [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2809.5s)]
*  The answer is he shouldn't have run for a second term [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2813.74s)]
*  And when he did run for a second term he should have stepped down much earlier after the debate [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2817.1s)]
*  And his close advisors shouldn't have told him to run again and they shouldn't have told him he was going to win [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2822.3799999999997s)]
*  And like every I think that every [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2828.06s)]
*  Democratic politician particularly those who want to lead the party and want to run in 2028 have to just rip the fucking band-aid off [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2830.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you need an answer to the question. Like we I don't think we didn't talk about it on this podcast [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2837.2599999999998s)]
*  We talked about it on trimmily online, but elizabeth warren had a brutal answer when she was pushed on this on a podcast [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2841.26s)]
*  And that's the first of many right and you can see some of these people when they start running for president in a couple years [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2848.38s)]
*  particularly those people maybe like p buddha judge who i'm sure will have a good answer to it but [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2854.1400000000003s)]
*  Who served in the biden administration or if kamala harris were to run again? [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2858.0600000000004s)]
*  She's gonna have to answer these questions. She's probably have to answer them when she does her first interview [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2861.6600000000003s)]
*  But she still has not done since the election ended [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2866.2200000000003s)]
*  To me like on one hand I am sympathetic to [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2869.18s)]
*  Biden's desire to defend his legacy in the face of these books coming out [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2875.8999999999996s)]
*  I'm sympathetic to the people who work for biden trying to defend a president that they have great affection and loyalty to [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2879.4199999999996s)]
*  And the work they did and I like I thought about this if joe if brock obama had lost [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2887.74s)]
*  To mitt romney in 2012 [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2893.1s)]
*  I would have been an absolute fucking lunatic trying to do everything I could to like reshape [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2894.86s)]
*  You know try to it's not his fault like his legacy look all the great things we did. So I understand that impulse [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2900.86s)]
*  But there is an element here of reading the room [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2906.38s)]
*  And there is so much bad shit happening in the country the threats are so dire and the threats are so dire to the things [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2910.46s)]
*  That joe biden dearly and sincerely cares about [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2916.3s)]
*  That this media tour is about joe biden it's not about donald trump it's about it's about joe biden defending himself and his legacy [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2918.86s)]
*  It's not about [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2926.2200000000003s)]
*  Which I wouldn't recommend this but it's not about using the platform or former president may have [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2928.86s)]
*  To criticize a sitting president to try to shift the the public debate in some way or the other it's about [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2933.1s)]
*  He's made it about himself. Yeah, and that I think was what she made the last fucking year of his presidency about [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2939.6600000000003s)]
*  Which is one of the reasons we're all here [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2945.9s)]
*  And so I that that to me is frustrating [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2947.9s)]
*  You know, there's been this like is it really bad that biden's back out there again politically. I don't think anyone [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2951.1s)]
*  Cares is the truth [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2956.14s)]
*  Just no one is no one's paying attention [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2958.2200000000003s)]
*  It is just we this was the problem in the election is the american people decided how they felt about joe biden [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2960.86s)]
*  Nothing he said or they did [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2965.58s)]
*  Could change was going to change their mind about it because it was right before their eyes [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2967.6600000000003s)]
*  It was like an obvious thing that he should not run for reelection [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2970.3s)]
*  And so they made up their mind and went and so I don't it's just it's not going to [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2973.44s)]
*  change [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2978.48s)]
*  Anything at all. Yeah, no my my the reason I care about this is [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2980.08s)]
*  in a world where [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2985.12s)]
*  Reporters just all decided never to ask democratic politicians about joe biden and the 2024 campaign again [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2986.88s)]
*  Then like let's none of us talk about it [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2993.84s)]
*  But that's not the world that we live in they're all going to be asked [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=2997.04s)]
*  And they're all going to get the question and um, you know, you don't have to like we don't know [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3000.72s)]
*  That he is suffering from any kind of cognitive decline or condition, right? [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3009.04s)]
*  We just we don't know that we all know what we saw what we've seen for the last year [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3013.2s)]
*  the man [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3017.2s)]
*  Can't communicate [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3018.48s)]
*  coherently [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3020.22s)]
*  on a consistent basis [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3021.36s)]
*  and [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3023.12s)]
*  That's the job of president. That's the job of candidate. That's how you sell your agenda [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3024.16s)]
*  That's how you run for office and he couldn't do it. So he shouldn't have run and [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3029.2s)]
*  Like the people who were closest to him [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3033.8399999999997s)]
*  Failed him in that regard not the whole staff like he said not all the people doing the work, but the inner circle [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3037.2799999999997s)]
*  In his family failed him in that regard and and and he failed too. And so like there's no [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3043.2799999999997s)]
*  I just think there's no reason and there's no there's no purpose to trying to [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3049.6s)]
*  Fuzz that up, especially because we have a credibility problem as a party, right? [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3054.72s)]
*  I mean both parties have a credibility problem. All politicians have a credibility problem [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3059.12s)]
*  But I do think that could be a threshold question for a lot of these candidates where it's like if democrats [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3062.64s)]
*  If people think that democrats or politicians in general are just bullshitting them when they talk [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3068.08s)]
*  Then this is going to be a prime example of democratic politicians of people thinking that they just got bullshitted again [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3072.88s)]
*  Uh, someone bullshitted them because they gave some answer where they were like [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3079.44s)]
*  He was fine and he did a lot of good things [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3082.7999999999997s)]
*  And now the party lost their mind after the debate and the polls actually showed this and all the [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3085.04s)]
*  Bullshit that they were saying [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3089.12s)]
*  I think yeah, I think that's true [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3090.8s)]
*  I think the press is gonna like this is going to be a hurdle that [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3092.2400000000002s)]
*  Attests the press is going to and I use the press in the broadest thing. I mean [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3095.2s)]
*  like [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3099.68s)]
*  The christian walker i'll meet the press to the podcaster who is doing the interview like like elizabeth warren got taken down on a podcast [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3101.12s)]
*  Not on you know, the situation room or whatever, right? [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3107.76s)]
*  Um [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3110.56s)]
*  The I think there's just two more things i know I said I didn't really talk about this [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3111.76s)]
*  But now I have a lot to say about it. So I apologize for that but fine the one thing I found very frustrating is [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3114.64s)]
*  Biden can't [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3119.76s)]
*  I mean, I know this is the like we know him. This is the pride in him [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3121.6s)]
*  But it is I find it very aggravating and infuriating frankly infuriating when he says that he thinks he would have won [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3125.04s)]
*  Yeah, I know because I feel like that's so it's [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3131.44s)]
*  Politically insane, right? It's just it's like detached from reality [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3134.08s)]
*  But even that even if you truly believe that to to verbalize that in such a direct way repeatedly [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3137.7599999999998s)]
*  Is to me so disrespectful of kamala harris who he put it in a possible position [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3143.8399999999997s)]
*  In a gazillion ways, right? Yeah from like some of the things she had to take on as vice president to [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3148.96s)]
*  The three weeks in where whatever it was between the debate and when he actually got out the month [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3156.56s)]
*  I guess 30 days whatever it was like that [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3160.88s)]
*  He took that time like that that like be but answer that question better in a more respectful way to your vice president who [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3162.8s)]
*  In a different world would have lost his vice president [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3169.52s)]
*  If he had stayed in the race, she would have lost his vice president and she would be the front runner for the democratic nomination [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3172.1600000000003s)]
*  She may still be that right now, but it's different because she was the nominee who lost [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3178.0800000000004s)]
*  and so it's just like so that angers me and the second piece is [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3182.32s)]
*  there is just like [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3186.32s)]
*  It is [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3188.0s)]
*  deeply naive to for biden and his team to think that he can really change the the [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3188.96s)]
*  Conversation around his legacy right now with interviews [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3194.32s)]

*  um [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3459.54s)]
*  It has now been several weeks since the supreme court upheld the district court's order [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3460.74s)]
*  That the trump administration must take steps to facilitate the release of kilmar obrego garcia [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3466.2599999999998s)]
*  trump administration has [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3471.2999999999997s)]
*  refused to do so [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3472.9799999999996s)]
*  trump basically [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3474.74s)]
*  Said he could but uh that his lawyers don't want to that was sort of the essence of the answer [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3476.2599999999998s)]
*  He gave terry moran of abc [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3481.9399999999996s)]
*  What happens now like and what can you do if you're? [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3484.1s)]
*  Uh kilmar obrego garcia's lawyers [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3487.7s)]
*  So I think what is going to happen is the district court proceedings are going to continue to play out [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3490.9s)]
*  It's likely that kilmar obrego garcia's lawyers might file a motion to show cause as to why the government isn't in contempt [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3495.22s)]
*  Of the lower court ruling directing the administration to facilitate obrego garcia's return [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3503.22s)]
*  There's always some discomfort with using out-of-court statements [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3508.3399999999997s)]
*  In court to actually prove them and so there is going to be some tension with well [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3512.4199999999996s)]
*  Do you actually take trump at his word when he wasn't signing a sworn declaration? [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3517.9399999999996s)]
*  Or hadn't been administered an oath and take that at face value and use it against him [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3522.98s)]
*  But I think it's not just that it's the fact that as you say [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3528.2599999999998s)]
*  So much time has passed [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3532.5s)]
*  They have done diddly squat and everybody knows that there is an agreement that obviously they have some leverage on [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3534.1s)]
*  I saw the new york times report that the state department sent a diplomatic note to bukele [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3540.98s)]
*  Um, basically asking him to facilitate the release and then he said no, obviously, this is like a cover your ass move [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3546.9s)]
*  Do you think the courts buy that is that enough for the courts? Does that qualify as trying to facilitate? [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3554.2599999999998s)]
*  Uh, you know, this is some of the difficulty that the supreme court I think put [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3560.02s)]
*  The lower court in because they told the lower court you cannot actually [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3564.82s)]
*  Effectuate the return that is you can't specifically order the precedent to do [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3569.44s)]
*  x y or z and so that gives the administration some cover to do these antics where they [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3573.86s)]
*  You know ping bukele and say wink wink [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3579.7000000000003s)]
*  Nudge nudge, right? Won't you return him and then bukele says no [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3583.06s)]
*  I will not and then everyone around us knows what's going on, but it's going to be difficult for courts to say [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3587.94s)]
*  We all know what's going on here, right? [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3594.1s)]
*  Like they want some direct evidence to kind of prove that I think there is enough for them to say [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3596.02s)]
*  The administration isn't facilitating the return but it's going to be a fight [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3601.1400000000003s)]
*  Do you think this ends up back at the supreme court at some point? Yes [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3605.78s)]
*  Unless the trump administration actually gets mr [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3609.2200000000003s)]
*  Arbago garcia as well as the other individuals that other courts have now concluded were wrongfully deported back [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3612.26s)]
*  There's no reason why their lawyers aren't going to ask the supreme court and other appellate courts [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3618.8999999999996s)]
*  To get the administration to actually do something [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3624.42s)]
*  Speaking of things that may end up back at the supreme court, you know, they they chose not to rule on [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3627.14s)]
*  the legality of trump [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3633.06s)]
*  Invoking the alien enemies act in this way, but now we have two judges [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3635.12s)]
*  One a trump appointed judge who have ruled that the invocation is unlawful [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3640.18s)]
*  Uh, we also have now a declassified [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3646.68s)]
*  intelligence report [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3649.88s)]
*  That they don't you know that the intelligence agencies with the partial exception of the fbi don't [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3651.56s)]
*  Don't really think that the maduro government [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3657.72s)]
*  Is coordinating with trende aragua and telling them to go invade the united states [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3661.08s)]
*  um [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3666.52s)]
*  I feel like that's going to be headed back to the supreme court as well [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3667.48s)]
*  Ideally before another few hundred people are shipped off to ccot like what's taken so long there [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3670.52s)]
*  That would be ideal. Um, you know, what's taking so long is the supreme court created this situation where they forced everyone to use this other [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3675.32s)]
*  Procedural mechanism to challenge the alien enemies act and that was always going to take some additional time [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3683.3s)]
*  To delay the supreme court actually having to say obviously you can't use the alien enemies act here [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3689.0800000000004s)]
*  You know, it's not just the declassified intelligence reports and whatnot [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3694.76s)]
*  We can all read and the statute says it applies to foreign nations when there's been a predatory incursion or invasion [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3698.2799999999997s)]
*  None of these things are true here. So [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3705.32s)]
*  Stephen miller and [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3710.2799999999997s)]
*  Who's not a lawyer? [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3712.44s)]
*  Uh and the president, uh, also not a lawyer jd vance who is a lawyer. He went to yale. It doesn't really count [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3713.64s)]
*  They keep arguing that you know due process only applies to citizens [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3720.92s)]
*  um or [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3726.12s)]
*  Or, you know jd vancer has to say well, we can't be expected to offer a hearing [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3727.8s)]
*  Uh for every immigrant, uh an asylum seeker before we deport them [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3733.1600000000003s)]
*  Do you think there's any court that takes that legal argument seriously? [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3738.92s)]
*  I hesitate to say no court will because I am well aware of some of the individuals that donald trump has appointed to the lower courts [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3742.92s)]
*  right, you know there was the [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3750.44s)]
*  Classic let me order a nationwide ban on medication abortion, you know [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3752.44s)]
*  Doosie from matthew casmiric there's the eileen cannon specials of basically single-handedly preventing [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3757.16s)]
*  Any trial on the obstruction and wrongful retention of classified material charges against donald trump [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3763.24s)]
*  So i'm not going to say no court, but that doesn't mean the arguments aren't utter bullshit, right? [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3769.16s)]
*  Like again, we can all read the constitution says no person [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3775.24s)]
*  Shall be denied life liberty property without due process. It's not limited to citizens [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3779.3999999999996s)]
*  Also, no one is asking for full-blown trials for every individual who is part of immigration [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3785.7200000000003s)]
*  proceedings all they're asking for is [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3792.98s)]
*  Some sort of hearing before by the way an executive branch official like an asylum officer or immigration judge or board of immigration [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3796.2000000000003s)]
*  Appeals and it's not my fault that donald trump has fired a bunch of people made civil service intolerable [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3805.48s)]
*  And as terrorizing bureaucrats they could offer these hearings if they wanted to instead they have opted for [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3812.44s)]
*  effectively concentration camps also in that initial [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3820.1200000000003s)]
*  Alien enemies act ruling that was the five four ruling [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3824.28s)]
*  even there the majority was basically like well the government acknowledges that [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3828.44s)]
*  Everyone deserves due process and that is something that we've we all believe as well and that would seemingly include all nine of them [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3834.36s)]
*  So, I don't I don't even know what they're doing there just because the supreme court says something does not make it true [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3842.92s)]
*  John and this is one of the big lessons of my book lawless because while the supreme court said [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3848.6s)]
*  The government acknowledged that people were entitled to notice and the opportunity to challenge their detention [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3853.96s)]
*  In fact the actual papers that the government filed said they were under no obligation [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3859.56s)]
*  To modify when an individual was deported or expelled in order to give them time to challenge their deportation [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3865.5s)]
*  The government took the outlandish position that basically everyone walks around with habeas petitions in their pockets and boots [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3872.86s)]
*  And so whenever they are arrested or removed they have an opportunity to challenge their detention because they can just whip out that [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3879.34s)]
*  ready-made habeas petition that they all have [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3885.96s)]
*  You know in their wallets and handy so [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3888.38s)]
*  You know, yes the government kind of acknowledged that everyone is entitled to due process [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3891.02s)]
*  But they just define that to basically mean nothing and the supreme court knew that [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3895.26s)]
*  It seems like that would be a profitable business in this era [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3899.02s)]
*  Just to just make sure that everyone you can sell habeas petitions so that people just have them at the ready [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3901.6600000000003s)]
*  Should we get abducted by the government? I don't know, you know, I think part of the difficulty is the government is [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3907.02s)]
*  trotting out so many different bases for deporting and expelling people that even if you were carrying around a handy habeas [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3913.7400000000002s)]
*  Petition challenging one possible basis on which the government might send you to a foreign mega prison [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3920.38s)]
*  No guarantee that that's the actual ground they would invoke. It's a bit of a whack-a-mole there [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3925.1800000000003s)]
*  Um, yeah, so it seems like trump keeps losing in court when it comes to his most overtly [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3930.3s)]
*  authoritarian actions [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3937.6400000000003s)]
*  Banning law firms from practicing in federal court [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3939.1s)]
*  Was struck down by a federal judge last week [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3942.3s)]
*  Uh freezing federal funding tried to do that to maine that was struck down his attempt to regulate federal elections [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3944.78s)]
*  Uh, it seems like the doj has said they're not even going to bring that back after that got struck down to court [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3953.1s)]
*  Um, are you surprised relieved? [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3958.2200000000003s)]
*  Mildly heartened. What do you um, you know, I might use all of the adjectives, but i'm not [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3960.92s)]
*  breathing easy just yet in part because [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3967.9s)]
*  These cases have not made their way up through the appellate courts [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3971.58s)]
*  And I don't think it's an accident that lower courts are more uniformly ruling against the trump administration than the appellate courts [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3975.18s)]
*  or supreme court [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3983.3399999999997s)]
*  Is so you know lower courts they tend to be a little bit less ideological [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3985.18s)]
*  They're oftentimes appointed with the consent of the home state senators [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3989.3399999999997s)]
*  And so even people appointed by trump in states with democratic senators [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3992.46s)]
*  They're not going to be as cray cray as the people he's putting on the supreme court or the appellate courts [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=3995.98s)]
*  Yeah, I did [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4001.26s)]
*  I do find it [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4002.54s)]
*  I mean again, who knows with the with the court the judges we have out there right now [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4003.7400000000002s)]
*  But I do find that the um the eo on the law firms [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4008.38s)]
*  Um seems pretty obviously [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4011.9s)]
*  Unconstitutional i'm no legal scholar. I'm no lawyer, but like I don't know how that one gets upheld anywhere [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4014.84s)]
*  I hesitate just to say it's unconstitutional [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4020.7s)]
*  Because it manages to pack in like at least five different constitutional violations to a pretty short executive order [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4024.14s)]
*  so [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4032.62s)]
*  um [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4033.74s)]
*  Yeah, that one's really wild really wild [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4034.7s)]
*  Um, so all this brings us to your book lawless [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4038.3799999999997s)]
*  Which is about how we came to have a supreme court majority that essentially tries to disguise increasingly [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4040.7799999999997s)]
*  Extreme right-wing political views as carefully reasoned legal doctrine, uh that comes straight from the constitution [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4047.02s)]
*  Why did you want to write this book? [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4054.38s)]
*  So I started thinking about writing the book after the court overruled roe versus wade and it seemed like a moment when more people [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4056.14s)]
*  Were paying attention to the court and understanding just how broken the supreme court was, you know from my own perspective [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4062.22s)]
*  I was pretty nervous and scared about the supreme court back in [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4069.34s)]
*  2011 when I was clerking for the court and they came within one vote of dismantling the entire affordable care act [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4072.62s)]
*  And health insurance for so many people based on some kaka-mimi theory that the government might force us to eat broccoli one day [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4079.58s)]
*  and so [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4087.1s)]
*  I I thought people should be more worried about the supreme court back then [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4088.2999999999997s)]
*  Almost 10 years later when people were more concerned [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4093.2599999999998s)]
*  I thought I actually want to talk to people about just how bad things have gotten because there will inevitably be a moment [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4096.06s)]
*  When people come to believe maybe the supreme court isn't actually so bad [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4103.82s)]
*  um, and I want them to understand like how the court got us to this [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4108.14s)]
*  moment we are in and [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4112.22s)]
*  Just how messed up the court has become you sort of trace the the history of of how this all started [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4114.14s)]
*  Can you talk about the origin of the court's politicization? [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4120.62s)]
*  Um at least in the in the modern era and maybe um, explain the greenhouse effect, which I thought was a great example [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4124.64s)]
*  Yeah, so origins it's really an amalgamation of different grievance stews that they kind of threw in together [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4131.52s)]
*  and then decided to base a political movement around because [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4139.280000000001s)]
*  When the political parties were going through this big alignment after the civil rights movement, you know [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4143.12s)]
*  you had the republican party decide well, we want to cater to white southerners and [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4147.76s)]
*  Conservative christians and so they were adopting positions that almost by definition [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4153.68s)]
*  Were not going to appeal to a majority of the country and in particular groups that were newly included in civic society [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4158.64s)]
*  and so they kind of leaned into minority rule and [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4165.84s)]
*  Having minority rule [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4170.88s)]
*  Requires them to control the supreme court [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4172.72s)]
*  so they recognized we kind of need the supreme court in order to impose our [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4175.68s)]
*  Wildly unpopular weirdo views on the rest of the country [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4180.719999999999s)]
*  And so they went about trying to control the supreme court and they successfully took it over through, you know different factors [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4184.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm happy to talk about but that's kind of the high level story [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4191.679999999999s)]
*  And one of those factors relates to this greenhouse effect that you just alluded to so the greenhouse effect refers to [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4194.639999999999s)]
*  This idea that once republican presidents appointed republican justices to the supreme court [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4200.639999999999s)]
*  They drifted left because they would read news coverage about them and again because the median person in the country [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4206.639999999999s)]
*  Doesn't think women should be stripped of rights doesn't actually think the mega rich should control politics [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4213.84s)]
*  When the republican justices would write those things in opinions [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4219.5199999999995s)]
*  They would be criticized and they didn't like that [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4222.4s)]
*  And so they would drift left and the greenhouse effect was named for former new york times supreme court reporter linda greenhouse [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4224.719999999999s)]
*  So they created their own ecosystem like the federalist society that would provide the justices with affirmation for doing republican things [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4231.12s)]
*  So they got some validation and affirmation and they basically had [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4237.84s)]
*  built in fans for lack of a better word, so yeah, basically they realized they had to uh, [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4242.72s)]
*  Keep their uh, keep feeding them a steady stream of crazy in their media diet [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4248.24s)]
*  Just to kind of keep them part of the plan. Yeah, they built this echo chamber and that's part of it [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4252.8s)]
*  Do you get the sense that a lot of elected officials and legal experts and law professors [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4257.28s)]
*  are still reluctant to view the court's actions and decisions as [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4264.4s)]
*  Nakedly partisan or political [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4269.1s)]
*  Or do you think that shifted over time, especially with this court? [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4271.68s)]
*  I still think there is considerable reluctance to do so [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4274.56s)]
*  I think people tend to gravitate toward focusing on the differences between the republican appointees [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4277.68s)]
*  So we are fed a constant stream of stories about oh my gosh [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4283.68s)]
*  Amy coney barrett has not voted with the other republican appointees in every single case [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4287.200000000001s)]
*  Doesn't this prove that she is in fact a big secret liberal and the court is super moderate [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4292.160000000001s)]
*  No, in fact, it does not and I think people also who are part of the legal profession [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4299.120000000001s)]
*  Want to believe that the supreme court the law the legal profession is different than politics. It's something special [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4304.320000000001s)]
*  It requires some specialized training and it does in some respects, but the reality is how the court is operating now [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4311.84s)]
*  Can be explained with reference to politics and ideology and trying to report on supreme court decisions [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4319.200000000001s)]
*  And litigation without doing so is borderline malpractice at this point [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4325.76s)]
*  Where do you think that reluctance comes from because yeah, like I remember [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4330.240000000001s)]
*  I remember I sort of first came in contact with it when uh, we started doing the show and it was 2017 in gorsuch [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4334.72s)]
*  was [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4342.240000000001s)]
*  Was nominated in the gorsuch confirmation and there were people who you know in the legal profession had worked in democratic politics more [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4343.200000000001s)]
*  Liberal leaning were like I don't agree with I don't agree with gorsuch [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4351.66s)]
*  But you know, he's still a he's still a good guy and he's got some solid legal, you know background and he's really smart [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4355.68s)]
*  Actually the first time I heard it a little around the roberts [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4362.400000000001s)]
*  confirmation way back in 2005 when I was working for then senator obama people started saying that too, but [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4365.42s)]
*  Um, you know, it feels like it's dissipated a bit since then but it always surprised me [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4371.04s)]
*  I'm like, where does this come from? Why do you feel the need to do this? [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4375.280000000001s)]
*  You know, I don't know where to start with that [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4378.0s)]
*  You know [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4381.360000000001s)]
*  I could remind you or ask you to remind all of the people that were saying that about neil gorsuch that [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4381.92s)]
*  In the last few weeks neil gorsuch looked at the book called pride puppy and insisted it had bondage workers [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4388.08s)]
*  And sex workers when in fact all it had was a woman in a leather jacket at a pride parade [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4394.160000000001s)]
*  So maybe not such a legal super genius or maybe he can't read. I don't know [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4398.8s)]
*  But as to like why people want to continue to insist that no, this isn't just political [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4404.88s)]
*  you know [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4412.4800000000005s)]
*  Doing the podcast and studying the court has given me insight into the minds of sam alito and neil gorsuch [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4413.52s)]
*  And those are really dark bleak places [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4420.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't know that I have as firm a grasp on why the legal commentariat or legal profession [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4423.12s)]
*  Sticks to this idea that we shouldn't explain the court and its decisions and its reasoning in terms of politics or ideology [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4429.6s)]
*  Some of it comes from for people in the media a desire to appear unbiased and to do both sides [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4439.52s)]
*  I think some of it comes from people in the legal profession [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4446.08s)]
*  Again a desire to lean on this idea that there is a specialized training and expertise which again I can see there is [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4448.96s)]
*  But they want that to matter more than politics when we need to acknowledge [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4456.080000000001s)]
*  both and part of why I wanted to write the book [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4462.240000000001s)]
*  Is when you put out the actual reasoning in the decisions and you situate that in terms of here were the political talking points [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4466.320000000001s)]
*  That were happening 20 years before 10 years before [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4474.160000000001s)]
*  The language is just totally ripped from it [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4478.160000000001s)]
*  I mean john roberts again that super genius guy who was just calling balls and strikes who's super modern [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4480.96s)]
*  institutionalist literally struck down a key provision [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4487.58s)]
*  Of the voting rights act section 5 in shelby county by saying [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4490.96s)]
*  It illegally discriminated against who the former confederacy the poor former confederate states [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4494.64s)]
*  Who were victimized for being called out for their history of racial discrimination? [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4501.76s)]
*  And guess whose objection that was to the voting rights act all along [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4506.18s)]
*  segregationist strom thurmond who literally called it right like political [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4510.4800000000005s)]
*  vendettas and retribution and a campaign against a certain part of the country, so [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4515.2s)]
*  Yeah, he whitewashed it. Sanwashed it a little but it's still the same stuff [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4520.82s)]
*  Yeah, it does it seems like it mirrors a bit what we've seen in electoral politics as well [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4526.26s)]
*  On on the left or at least the center left which is you know, we believe deeply in institutions democratic institutions and want to [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4533.139999999999s)]
*  defend those institutions or at least make those institutions work and make sure that they're trusted and you get caught between [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4542.74s)]
*  wanting to have faith in the institutions and [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4550.179999999999s)]
*  Believing that the institutions operate based on a certain set of objective rules and principles [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4553.46s)]
*  Whereas the right has decided that they just want to tear down those institutions [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4558.92s)]
*  So and you're like well look and I wonder just like where you think [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4564.0s)]
*  like what you think the best strategy for [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4568.5599999999995s)]
*  Liberals is here or people in the legal profession who just want to take the court back from sort of the extreme right like is [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4572.16s)]
*  Mirroring what the right has done the best strategy should there be a liberal version of the federalist society or or? [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4579.28s)]
*  What are you what are your thoughts on that? Yeah, so, you know in addition to tearing down the institutions [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4586.76s)]
*  I mean, I think we should understand what the republican party has done with the supreme court as effectively [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4592.44s)]
*  Weaponizing it and like capturing the machinery of the state because through the supreme court [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4597.78s)]
*  They basically made it so joe biden couldn't govern right? [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4602.5199999999995s)]
*  They took one of his most popular policies student debt relief and blew it up [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4605.88s)]
*  And then you had people blaming biden and the democrats for not doing student debt relief when no, no, no [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4610.36s)]
*  That was the supreme court. So as to this institutionalism [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4616.28s)]
*  Institutionalist thing I agree that is just a big challenge for people on the left democrats center left [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4620.9s)]
*  You know, I believe there have to be institutions. I believe in the rule of law [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4627.24s)]
*  It just also is the case that I look at the institution [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4632.04s)]
*  We currently have the supreme court and it is not functioning as an institution that is part of a constitutional liberal democracy [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4635.88s)]
*  Should function and so it needs to be changed. I don't think that makes me not an institutionalist [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4643.82s)]
*  I actually think that makes me an institutionalist because I actually want you to bolster and make this a [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4649.18s)]
*  legitimate functioning place [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4654.52s)]
*  As to how we get there [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4657.02s)]
*  I'm not a big fan of this federal society of the left in part because the federal society works in part because [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4658.46s)]
*  It's based on fringe theories. They are a minority, right? [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4665.02s)]
*  It's easier to credential people in that system and have those network effects when you're operating with smaller numbers [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4667.74s)]
*  I think there are parts of the conservative legal movement. The left should replicate [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4674.3s)]
*  Campaigning against the court making the court part of politics. That should absolutely be part of the strategy like identifying again a kind of [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4678.44s)]
*  Common punching bag that we can all mock and make fun of and run against like that's [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4686.54s)]
*  Part of what makes politics fun and it can be effective as well [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4691.26s)]
*  And so I think there are components of the conservative legal movement strategy that can be replicated [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4694.22s)]
*  Some that can't and some that shouldn't be the book is lawless how the supreme court runs on conservative grievance fringe theories [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4699.9800000000005s)]
*  And bad vibes. It's out may 13th, but you can pre-order [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4706.46s)]
*  Right now wherever books are sold [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4711.02s)]
*  Uh, go get this book [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4713.9800000000005s)]
*  I have to say, you know [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4715.580000000001s)]
*  I never went down the legal path because I took a couple of law classes in in undergrad and it was like too dense for me [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4716.700000000001s)]
*  And you write this book and it's so funny and it's so accessible and still so smart [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4723.74s)]
*  That if I had had a book like this in college, who knows? Maybe I would have gone to law school. So [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4729.26s)]
*  Everyone everyone go go buy lawless go pre-order it and then go buy it next week. Well, thank you so much [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4733.66s)]
*  And if you're on the fence, I just say try to make sam alito even matter than he already is. Yes [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4740.14s)]
*  That is it. That is it. Uh leo litman. Thank you as always for joining. Thank you. That's our show for today [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P-GjuQRLOw&t=4747.18s)]
