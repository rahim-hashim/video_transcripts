Video Description: The price of eggs is still high, the stock market is sinking, but Donald Trump is fulfilling at least one campaign promise: using the power of the government to punish those who disagree with him. ICE arrests one of the leaders of the campus protests at Columbia—a legal permanent resident—and sends him to a detention facility, while the administration strips $400 million in grants and contracts for the university itself. And, with a pair of executive orders, Trump seeks to withhold student loan relief from people who help undocumented immigrants, provide gender-affirming care for minors, or run DEI programs—and he bans a prominent Democratic-affiliated law firm from even entering federal buildings. Meanwhile, Trump refuses to say whether we should expect a recession, more juicy reporting emerges of the Cabinet and Elon Musk meeting last week, and Democrats squabble over how to respond to it all. Jon, Lovett, and Tommy discuss Trump's crackdown on dissent, whether he can be swayed by political pressure, and how Democrats should aim for authenticity rather than the latest meme when making their case. Then, Lovett catches up with Bernie Sanders on the Michigan leg of his "Fight Oligarchy" tour.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Donald Trump Is Attacking Free Speech and the First Amendment As The Stock Market Tumbles
**Pod Save America:** [March 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E)
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Jon Favreau. I'm Jon Lovett. I'm Tommy Vitor. On today's show, Donald Trump may plunge the country into a recession [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=0.0s)]
*  but seems oddly okay with it, which seems like a problem for all of us that we'll talk about. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=6.72s)]
*  We'll also get into the throwdown between Elon Musk and Trump's cabinet [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=11.24s)]
*  during a meeting where Elon reportedly fought with Marco Rubio over not firing enough people and [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=15.6s)]
*  Sean Duffy over Musk's attempt to fire air traffic controllers. Excited to fly this week. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  Then we'll cover Democrats debate over the party shutdown strategy and basically everything else. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=25.799999999999997s)]
*  And speaking of Democrats, Lovett will regale us with tales from his weekend trip to Michigan [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=32.6s)]
*  where he caught up with Bernie Sanders on his fight oligarchy tour. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=37.32s)]
*  Hell yeah, I did. Look at you. Feeling the burn. Quick little trip to Michigan. One day. One day. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=41.18s)]
*  All right, but first [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=47.32s)]
*  we try not to alarm you all on this show unless it's [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=49.16s)]
*  necessary. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=53.0s)]
*  But there are a few stories out there about the Trump regime cracking down on dissent and opposition that make you wonder [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=53.839999999999996s)]
*  how we'd react if this was happening in another country. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=61.559999999999995s)]
*  So over the weekend ICE agents with the federal government detained a legal permanent resident in New York, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=65.0s)]
*  took him away from his very pregnant wife, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=72.4s)]
*  threw him in a detention center in Louisiana, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=75.92s)]
*  all despite the fact that they have not charged him with a crime. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=78.4s)]
*  His name is Mahmoud Khalil and he's a Columbia graduate who's been the leader of the university's pro-Gaza protests. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=82.72s)]
*  Trump is bragging about the arrest and said that it's part of his promise to find and deport any student [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=89.52s)]
*  protesters who he believes have engaged in what he's calling quote pro-terrorist anti-semitic [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=95.0s)]
*  anti-American activity. The Trump administration also cited anti-semitism as the reason they're canceling [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=100.52s)]
*  $400 million in grants and contracts to Columbia University. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=106.88000000000001s)]
*  As a note, more than a quarter of the school's operating budget comes from federal grants, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=112.12s)]
*  so this is gonna have a real impact on faculty, on students, on tuition costs, all the rest. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  I could spend a little bit of that fucking endowment though. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  I don't agree with it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  There we go. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  Anyway, continue. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=128.32s)]
*  I hope they don't come after Williams. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=130.32s)]
*  Listen, first they came for Columbia and I did not speak out. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=132.32s)]
*  I went to a small liberal arts college in northwestern Massachusetts that few people have heard of. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=134.32s)]
*  Trump also signed an executive order on Friday that orders the government's public service loan forgiveness program. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=139.84s)]
*  You get help with your student loans if you go into a career in public service. It's been around forever. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=145.12s)]
*  To exclude anyone at any group that provides or supports [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  gender-affirming care for minors, helps undocumented immigrants, or runs DEI programs. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=154.0s)]
*  On Thursday, he signed an executive order canceling all federal contracts, security clearances, and even access to federal buildings [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  from Perkins Cooey, a law firm that does a lot of work for Democrats. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  Federal buildings, which is where, by the way, they would, the courthouses are federal buildings, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=170.72s)]
*  and so it's just where they would practice law. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=175.68s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=177.68s)]
*  Last month, Trump signed a similar order canceling security clearances for anyone at the law firm of Covington and Burling [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=179.68s)]
*  because they did some work with gender-affirming care for minors. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=183.68s)]
*  Here's Trump talking about this decision with Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on Sunday morning. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  We have a lot of law firms that we're going to be going after because they were very dishonest people. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  They were very, very dishonest. They could go point after point after point, and it was so bad for our country. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  We have a lot of law firms that we're going after. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=208.24s)]
*  Let's start with the Columbia situation. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=210.24s)]
*  I should note that right before we recorded, a judge has temporarily blocked Khalil's deportation until there's an actual hearing, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=212.8s)]
*  which I believe is scheduled for Wednesday, at least the first of maybe a couple. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=219.60000000000002s)]
*  How big of a deal is this? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=223.60000000000002s)]
*  I think individually all these stories are a huge deal, and collectively it's an assault on free speech like we haven't seen in a very long time. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=225.60000000000002s)]
*  It should worry everybody. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=231.60000000000002s)]
*  Starting with Columbia, sometimes when Trump does something that's so far over the line, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=233.60000000000002s)]
*  conservatives react honestly for about 24 hours. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  That happened in this case. Ann Coulter tweeted, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=241.96s)]
*  There's almost no one I don't want to deport, but unless they've committed a crime, isn't this a violation of the First Amendment? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=243.96s)]
*  Yes, Ann. Yes, it is. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=248.96s)]
*  With free speech issues, in the abstract, we should be agnostic about the topic, the people involved, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=250.95999999999998s)]
*  whether you agree or disagree with what they said, whether you find it offensive or not. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=256.96s)]
*  If a lawful permanent resident can be rounded up by ICE agents or the Department of Homeland Security, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=260.96s)]
*  and if they're thrown into jail without charges, without even being charged or accused of a crime, that should worry everybody. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=266.32s)]
*  Yeah, so it's a small detail, but they didn't have to send this person to Louisiana. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=274.32s)]
*  There's detention facilities, there's ways of processing him in New York, New Jersey. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=279.32s)]
*  Originally they did have him in New York, New Jersey, and then they transferred him to Louisiana. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=285.32s)]
*  It's clearly punitive. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=289.32s)]
*  He's a lawful permanent resident. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=291.68s)]
*  For very good reason, lawful permanent residents are protected by the First Amendment, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=294.68s)]
*  the same way we're all protected by the First Amendment. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=298.68s)]
*  There are ways in which the government can revoke somebody's immigration status, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=301.68s)]
*  but it's not as punishment for speech you don't like. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=305.68s)]
*  And by the way, it's not even as punishment for speech you don't like that may be associated with protests [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=307.68s)]
*  in which some people broke the rules or broke the law or what have you. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=311.68s)]
*  You charge somebody with a crime, right? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=315.68s)]
*  You broke the law, you charged that person with whatever that crime is, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=318.04s)]
*  that due process then may ultimately result in somebody losing immigration status, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=322.04s)]
*  something that happens all the time, if you get fraud when you apply, right? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=327.04s)]
*  There's lots of ways immigration status can be revoked, but no, you can't just say, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=331.04s)]
*  oh, this person is participating in protests, and there's very Orwellian language, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=335.04s)]
*  and I'd never say Orwellian because it's been such a fucking cliché and just overused phrase, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=339.04s)]
*  but I'd say it was for protests aligned to terrorist organizations, deeply strange. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=345.40000000000003s)]
*  One of the ways that you can revoke a green card, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=351.40000000000003s)]
*  and by the way, like you said, the State Department cannot just revoke a green card on its own, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=355.40000000000003s)]
*  it has to go through a hearing, there has to be an immigration judge involved. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=360.40000000000003s)]
*  One of the ways you can revoke a green card is if someone is a member of a terrorist organization [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=363.40000000000003s)]
*  or an extremist organization or has provided support, right? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=367.40000000000003s)]
*  There's a threat to the United States because they're providing support to a terrorist organization. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=371.40000000000003s)]
*  So clearly the White House wants to say that anyone who participated in these protests [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=374.76s)]
*  is Hamas or providing support to Hamas, but again, no crime has been charged [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=378.76s)]
*  and no evidence has been provided that this person provided any kind of material support to Hamas [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=383.76s)]
*  or was part of Hamas or anything like that. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=389.76s)]
*  I think most terrorism prosecutions are providing material support. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=391.76s)]
*  So if they had any evidence of that, they would have charged this kid with a crime. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=395.76s)]
*  Exactly, exactly. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=398.76s)]
*  By the way, the way this happened is he was coming home and outside his apartment [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=400.12s)]
*  there were four plainclothes agents and they identified themselves to him and his wife. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=406.12s)]
*  They asked who he was and then they said, you're coming with us. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=411.12s)]
*  His wife, who's eight months pregnant, ran to get his green card [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=414.12s)]
*  because they said, oh, we're taking away your student visa. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=417.12s)]
*  She's like, well, he's not a student visa holder, he's a green card holder. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=419.12s)]
*  And then the ICE agent is on the phone with someone and is like, oh, we're taking him in anyway. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=422.12s)]
*  They're doing this on the fly. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=425.12s)]
*  I will say, I made the general point about free speech. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=427.48s)]
*  I also think in this specific instance, like as someone who's talked publicly about Gaza and Israel [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=429.48s)]
*  and the two-state solution for a very long time, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=435.48s)]
*  there is a long-term sustained effort to police speech on this specific topic, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=437.48s)]
*  especially to define criticism of Israel as anti-Semitic [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=441.48s)]
*  or activism that protests Israel like the BDS movement as anti-Semitic. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=445.48s)]
*  And so Trump is building off of not just those efforts to punish protesters, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=450.48s)]
*  but how they're going to use this as a pretext to punish universities. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=455.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, imagine if an Israeli citizen was here and has a green card, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=458.84000000000003s)]
*  is a legal permanent resident, and said, you know, I hope Netanyahu finishes the job. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=463.84000000000003s)]
*  I hope they kill everyone in Gaza. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=469.84000000000003s)]
*  And then that person is just deported or detained in the middle of the night, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=472.84000000000003s)]
*  sent to Louisiana, and we just don't hear from them, we don't know. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=477.84000000000003s)]
*  And now imagine there's over 13 million legal residents in America, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=481.2s)]
*  of all nationalities, from all backgrounds. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=485.2s)]
*  And so if you play this out, then you imagine ICE just going up to legal residents, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=488.2s)]
*  because now they all know who they are, where they are, right? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=493.2s)]
*  You go to a legal resident and you say, it depends on what their background is. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=496.2s)]
*  Oh, you're Ukrainian? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=500.2s)]
*  Oh, you must be with some, you know, the Nazi group in Ukraine that Elon Musk is always talking about. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=501.2s)]
*  Or, oh, you're Latino, you must be with Trendyagra, or whatever, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=508.56s)]
*  one of the cartels, Trendyagra that they've now labeled terrorist organizations. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=512.56s)]
*  And now we have legal permanent residents in this country who've done everything right, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=518.56s)]
*  who are applying for citizenship, just like you're supposed to do, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=522.56s)]
*  and now we're just going to detain them? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=526.56s)]
*  And send them away? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=529.56s)]
*  And allow me to put on my Jew hat for a moment. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=531.56s)]
*  I'm literally, I actually, this is an accident, I'm actually wearing a deli hat, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=533.56s)]
*  I'm literally wearing a Jew hat today. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=536.92s)]
*  I condemn that speech. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=539.92s)]
*  Yeah, condemn it all you want. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=542.92s)]
*  But, you know, look, Tommy's point, let's say that this person had a bunch of anti-Semitic comments. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=543.92s)]
*  Protected. Anti-Semitism is protected speech. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=550.92s)]
*  I don't like it. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=554.92s)]
*  I don't like a lot of what I heard at some of these protests that I do think go from anti-Zionism [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=555.92s)]
*  into pure anti-Semitism on the regular. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=559.92s)]
*  But to see the Anti-Defamation League put out a comment with this sort of to-be-sure at the end [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=564.28s)]
*  about everyone deserving due process, but ultimately coming down on the side [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=568.28s)]
*  of what the Trump administration is doing is so fucking stupid. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=572.28s)]
*  The idea that, like, oh yeah, be a kind of patron to what Trump's doing, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=576.28s)]
*  be a good Jew who supports the regime, that'll protect us in the end. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=581.28s)]
*  The thing that protects Jewish people from anti-Semitism is the culture of freedom, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=585.28s)]
*  a legal order that protects freedom, including the freedom of green card holders, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=591.64s)]
*  not just citizens, but non-citizens in this country. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=595.64s)]
*  That protection is ultimately what makes Jews safe in America. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=597.64s)]
*  The idea that going down a road in which people think it is defensible for the Trump administration [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=600.64s)]
*  to come knocking on somebody's door who has not been accused of a crime [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=604.64s)]
*  to revoke their immigration status for speech and protests you don't like [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=608.64s)]
*  is so, it's obviously morally reprehensible, but it is so fucking stupid in the long term. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=611.64s)]
*  That makes every Jewish person in America less safe. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=616.64s)]
*  Think about the road we're going on. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=620.0s)]
*  There are posters in the schools. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=622.0s)]
*  They say, first they came for the socialists. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=624.0s)]
*  What do they think comes after that? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=626.0s)]
*  And then they were cool. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=628.0s)]
*  It's so stupid. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=630.0s)]
*  It's so obvious. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=632.0s)]
*  There's all these people that have pretended to care about history and to learn from history [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=634.0s)]
*  and think about history, and it's happening right in front of our faces, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=638.0s)]
*  and they're too either cynical or naive to realize that they're the people [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=641.0s)]
*  not doing the right thing in the moment when they're supposed to. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=644.0s)]
*  I would also say that this is why, right, I would guess this is why [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=647.36s)]
*  the Trump administration singled this man out and started with this conflict [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=652.36s)]
*  because Donald Trump doesn't actually give a fuck about Gaza or the conflict. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=657.36s)]
*  It's just another thing he's dealing with. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=661.36s)]
*  But they know that tensions are so high around this [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=663.36s)]
*  that they can get a ridiculous fucking reaction like that from the ADL [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=666.36s)]
*  and then they will limit the protest, the breadth of the protest in this country [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=670.36s)]
*  about what they're doing, and then they can go to the next step. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=676.72s)]
*  That's why they're like, well, this is sort of a lightning rod. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=679.72s)]
*  And the way we know that is the White House, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=682.72s)]
*  not only did Donald Trump brag about it on Truth Social, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=684.72s)]
*  the official White House account tweeted Shalom Mahmood [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=687.72s)]
*  and is bragging about it, which is also to chill other speech [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=691.72s)]
*  from anyone who opposes the administration on any issue. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=697.72s)]
*  I enjoy the irony of this all happening right as we're learning [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=700.72s)]
*  that the White House has been holding direct talks with Hamas [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=704.08s)]
*  about getting hostages out of Gaza, which I support, by the way. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=707.08s)]
*  I think it's the right thing to do. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=710.08s)]
*  I think it's ridiculous that we have to go through Qatar [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=711.08s)]
*  or some other carve-out of conversations with the group [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=713.08s)]
*  holding an American citizen. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=715.08s)]
*  I know, maybe the people engaging in the direct talk should be deported. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=717.08s)]
*  If Joe Biden had done that, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=720.08s)]
*  Lindsey Graham would have filed articles of impeachment on the spot. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=721.08s)]
*  That's right. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=724.08s)]
*  So what do you think the whole crusade against the law firms is about? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=725.08s)]
*  I think it's just the chilling effect on these law firms. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=730.44s)]
*  They want these lawyers to not want to take cases [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=733.44s)]
*  where they sue the Trump administration or oppose them in any way. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=736.44s)]
*  In some instances, it's just an act of vengeance, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=739.44s)]
*  like going after Jack Smith. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=741.44s)]
*  Yeah, I think the worst-case scenario for the Trump administration [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=742.44s)]
*  is this gets shot down pretty quickly while costing Perkins Cooy [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=746.44s)]
*  a bunch of money having to hire another law firm to represent them. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=750.44s)]
*  All this is expensive. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=753.44s)]
*  All this makes life more difficult. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=754.44s)]
*  He's just punishing his enemies. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=756.44s)]
*  He doesn't need to go further than this [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=757.44s)]
*  to have been effective. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=759.8000000000001s)]
*  The further it goes, the more fun he's having. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=760.8000000000001s)]
*  I think the point that Tommy just raised is it's going beyond. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=762.8000000000001s)]
*  The intent is to go beyond punishing his enemies [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=765.8000000000001s)]
*  because if other firms that are not his enemies [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=768.8000000000001s)]
*  end up taking a case that is suing the government, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=771.8000000000001s)]
*  then Trump can go after them. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=775.8000000000001s)]
*  Or the other thing that can happen is there's a big law firm [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=777.8000000000001s)]
*  and they take a case suing the government [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=780.8000000000001s)]
*  and the big law firm also has other clients [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=783.8000000000001s)]
*  that are big corporate clients that have business before the government [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=785.8000000000001s)]
*  and now they're like, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=789.16s)]
*  do I really want to take that case that's suing the government [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=790.16s)]
*  because the Trump administration might come after us [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=792.16s)]
*  or I might lose this corporate client [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=794.16s)]
*  because now our firm is lightening around as well. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=796.16s)]
*  That's what a lot of these lawyers are, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=798.16s)]
*  at least that's what they were telling the Wall Street Journal, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=800.16s)]
*  but they were saying it quietly because now they're all afraid to speak up. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=802.16s)]
*  I think we've got to see how it plays out, right? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=805.16s)]
*  Because Perkins Cooy hired Williams & Connolly, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=807.16s)]
*  which is a bipartisan firm that has some Trump people in it. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=809.16s)]
*  And some of this is like, does our law firm have a guy [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=812.16s)]
*  that can call a guy to say leave us alone? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=815.16s)]
*  There's a relationship thing here. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=817.52s)]
*  So some of this I think it's like, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=820.52s)]
*  yeah, I think we just have to see how it plays out. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=822.52s)]
*  There were reports early on that the Trump people were telling big firms [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=824.52s)]
*  do not hire people out of Biden DOJ, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=827.52s)]
*  especially the Jack Smith team. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=829.52s)]
*  So this is sort of part of a longer process [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=831.52s)]
*  of just trying to keep really good lawyers from opposing them in any way. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=834.52s)]
*  And again, we just talked about people being detained. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=837.52s)]
*  So the Trump administration comes after you for whatever, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=840.52s)]
*  a defamation case of this or that, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=843.52s)]
*  whatever they do. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=845.88s)]
*  And you try to find a good lawyer. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=846.88s)]
*  And now some of these big firms are like, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=848.88s)]
*  do I want to take this case on? I don't know. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=850.88s)]
*  And that's the effect of this. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=852.88s)]
*  And good for Williams & Connolly for jumping in to defend Perkins Cooy [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=854.88s)]
*  because a lot of these law firms should ban together [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=857.88s)]
*  and make a public statement. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=860.88s)]
*  And the journal reported that there had been some attempt to do that. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=862.88s)]
*  And they haven't wanted to do that yet because they were a little nervous. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=865.88s)]
*  Yeah, I can't believe these lawyers are looking out for their own interests [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=868.88s)]
*  against these other law firms that they compete with on a daily basis [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=873.24s)]
*  on behalf of the sleaziest corporations on planet Earth. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=876.24s)]
*  I do worry about this politically. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=879.24s)]
*  I mean, on its face, it seems like such a brazen First Amendment violation. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=881.24s)]
*  But I don't know, historically speaking, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=884.24s)]
*  this country has not always been sympathetic to protesters. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=886.24s)]
*  I always think about how after Kent State, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=889.24s)]
*  58% of the country blamed the students, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=891.24s)]
*  11% of the country blamed the National Guard troops who shot them. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=893.24s)]
*  The sentiment was they got what they deserved. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=896.24s)]
*  So I do worry that, I don't know, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=899.24s)]
*  I worry that Trump people think that going after a bunch of Gaza protesters [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=901.6s)]
*  will be good politics for them and that they might know something we don't. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=905.6s)]
*  It makes me very nervous. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=909.6s)]
*  Me too. And I do think, whether it's the law firms, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=911.6s)]
*  whether it's what they're doing to some of these Gaza protesters, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=913.6s)]
*  everyone just has to be aware that this is going on [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=918.6s)]
*  and that the more people who speak up [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=922.6s)]
*  and the more people who stand in solidarity with the people who are targeted, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=924.6s)]
*  whether you disagree with them or not, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=928.6s)]
*  whether you like them or not, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=930.96s)]
*  the harder it's going to be for the Trump administration to pull this off, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=932.96s)]
*  they win if they start doing this and picking out people up the right [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=935.96s)]
*  and then everyone else is like, well, I'm not going to say anything. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=938.96s)]
*  There was this whole New York Times story over the weekend too [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=940.96s)]
*  about how all these people who spoke out in the first term against Trump [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=942.96s)]
*  are quiet now and a lot of them went on background, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=946.96s)]
*  a lot of people wouldn't say anything. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=948.96s)]
*  It's the wrong way to handle this. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=950.96s)]
*  Yes, well, it's also just like, take a step back. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=952.96s)]
*  Why do they think it's such good politics [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=954.96s)]
*  to chill free speech and go against protests? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=956.96s)]
*  Why do they think it's such good politics to go against foreign aid? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=959.32s)]
*  Why do they think it's such a good politics [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=961.32s)]
*  to pull these completely, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=963.32s)]
*  these moves that are just completely inactive [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=965.32s)]
*  to what America is supposed to represent? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=967.32s)]
*  It's because they don't believe there's enough people [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=969.32s)]
*  that are going to make the argument successfully to the country [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=971.32s)]
*  and that people will go with their base gut animal instincts [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=973.32s)]
*  on issue after issue. They're counting on that. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=977.32s)]
*  They also think that they can make it about the specifics of the case [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=979.32s)]
*  or what someone said or did versus the principal [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=982.32s)]
*  and we have to focus on the principal. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=984.32s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=986.32s)]
*  Speaking of that Maria Bartiromo interview, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=988.6800000000001s)]
*  Trump also got lots of questions on the economy, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=990.6800000000001s)]
*  especially about his on-again-off-again trade war. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=992.6800000000001s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=994.6800000000001s)]
*  Are you expecting a recession this year? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=996.6800000000001s)]
*  I hate to predict things like that. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=998.6800000000001s)]
*  There is a period of transition [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1000.6800000000001s)]
*  because what we're doing is very big. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1002.6800000000001s)]
*  We're bringing wealth back to America. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1004.6800000000001s)]
*  That's a big thing. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1006.6800000000001s)]
*  And there are always periods of... [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1008.6800000000001s)]
*  It takes a little time. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1010.6800000000001s)]
*  It takes a little time. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1012.6800000000001s)]
*  Even if you're a politician, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1014.6800000000001s)]
*  it takes a little time. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1017.04s)]
*  You said, look, we're going to have a disruption, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1019.04s)]
*  but we're okay with that. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1021.04s)]
*  Is that what you meant? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1023.04s)]
*  The stock market going down was the disruption? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1025.04s)]
*  What other disruption were you alluding to? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1027.04s)]
*  Look, what I have to do is build a strong country. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1029.04s)]
*  You can't really watch the stock market. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1031.04s)]
*  If you look at China, they have a hundred-year perspective. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1033.04s)]
*  We have a quarter. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1035.04s)]
*  We go by quarters. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1037.04s)]
*  That's true. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1039.04s)]
*  I guess someone's out of the prediction business. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1041.04s)]
*  So, on Friday's show, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1043.04s)]
*  we talked about how Trump backed down for now [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1045.3999999999999s)]
*  on most of the tariffs against Canada and Mexico, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1047.3999999999999s)]
*  though he's apparently sticking with tariffs [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1049.3999999999999s)]
*  on foreign steel and aluminum [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1051.3999999999999s)]
*  that are set to go into effect on Wednesday. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1053.3999999999999s)]
*  China's retaliatory tariffs [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1055.3999999999999s)]
*  on American agricultural products [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1057.3999999999999s)]
*  have now gone into effect. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1059.3999999999999s)]
*  The Canadians are also hitting us with some retaliatory tariffs. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1061.3999999999999s)]
*  And their new prime minister, Mark Carney, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1063.3999999999999s)]
*  said in a speech Sunday that America [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1065.3999999999999s)]
*  wants to, quote, destroy our way of life. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1067.3999999999999s)]
*  And reaching for a hockey metaphor, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1069.3999999999999s)]
*  said, quote, we didn't ask for this fight, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1071.3999999999999s)]
*  but Canadians are always ready when someone else [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1073.76s)]
*  drops the gloves. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1075.76s)]
*  He found it. He found it. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1077.76s)]
*  Wasn't reaching. He got that one. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1079.76s)]
*  What's icing? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1081.76s)]
*  When you shoot it from your zone all the way [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1083.76s)]
*  into the other zone without someone [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1085.76s)]
*  touching it after two lines or something like that. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1087.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1089.76s)]
*  It's a very boring penalty. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1091.76s)]
*  The market seemed less enthused by this trade war [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1093.76s)]
*  and continued a three-week sell-off on Monday [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1095.76s)]
*  amid fears of the recession [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1097.76s)]
*  that Trump has refused to rule out. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1099.76s)]
*  What do you think, guys? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1103.76s)]
*  So Trump and his team have now called this a transition, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1105.76s)]
*  an adjustment, a disturbance, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1107.76s)]
*  and Scott Besson called it a detox period. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1109.76s)]
*  A detox was the one I really liked. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1111.76s)]
*  It's also funny, by the way, that... [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1113.76s)]
*  I just love, you know, we need like a few months [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1115.76s)]
*  of just sort of clean, economic [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1117.76s)]
*  recession to kind of just get a lot of [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1119.76s)]
*  these growth toxins out of our body. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1121.76s)]
*  It's like dry 2025. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1123.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1125.76s)]
*  It's... [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1127.76s)]
*  It's... [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1129.76s)]
*  It doesn't seem great. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1132.12s)]
*  Correction. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1134.12s)]
*  Icing is when you shoot it from your side of the center line [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1136.12s)]
*  all the way past the opposing team's goal line. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1138.12s)]
*  Icing and offsides have never made sense to me. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1140.12s)]
*  Offsides are different. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1142.12s)]
*  I know it's a different story. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1144.12s)]
*  You had to get them the puck before they crossed. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1146.12s)]
*  Anyway, my buddy, Dan Nathan, is a very smart finance guy. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1148.12s)]
*  He made this point to me. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1150.12s)]
*  In 2017, Trump did his tax cut first. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1152.12s)]
*  So that juices the market. It juices the economy. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1154.12s)]
*  Then he started going with the tariffs. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1156.12s)]
*  Now they've got it all back-ass-ward. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1158.12s)]
*  He's going to start the trade war. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1160.4799999999998s)]
*  He's tanking the market. He's weakening the economy. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1162.4799999999998s)]
*  He's weakening his political standing. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1164.4799999999998s)]
*  And then he's going to try to ram through this massive tax cut [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1166.4799999999998s)]
*  that no one actually thinks will be paid for. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1168.4799999999998s)]

*  I'm a little honestly like my late night worry [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1178.4799999999998s)]

*  that like the more unstable the American economy gets, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1182.4799999999998s)]
*  the more he's sort of hedged against it. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1184.4799999999998s)]
*  That's not what... [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1186.4799999999998s)]
*  Bitcoin is like basically correlated [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1188.84s)]
*  with the Nasdaq and the market. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1190.84s)]

*  Yes, I'm just trying to explain why he seems to be [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1194.84s)]
*  a little less worried about the markets these days. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1196.84s)]
*  I think he's full of shit. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1198.84s)]
*  I think he's still just worried about it. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1200.84s)]
*  He's just like very mad that his in-house interviewer [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1202.84s)]
*  is not asking him the right questions. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1204.84s)]
*  I think it's very funny that on the same day [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1206.84s)]
*  that he does the Bar-Romo interview, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1208.84s)]
*  Howard Lutnick's on the Sunday shows [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1210.84s)]

*  The other part of this too is [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1234.1999999999998s)]
*  I talked about this with Bernie just a little bit, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1236.1999999999998s)]
*  but when the Bush people did their tax cuts, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1238.1999999999998s)]
*  they were smart enough to understand that politically [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1240.1999999999998s)]
*  you do it with... [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1242.1999999999998s)]
*  You finance it with the money. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1244.1999999999998s)]
*  You finance it with deficits. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1246.56s)]
*  Then you use those deficits to later claim you need to cut spending. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1248.56s)]
*  It was called starving the beast. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1250.56s)]
*  They understood that going out there and saying [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1252.56s)]
*  we're going to cut taxes for the richest people in America [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1254.56s)]
*  but in a deficit neutral way, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1256.56s)]
*  which means cutting a bunch of services, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1258.56s)]
*  also just makes your job that much harder. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1260.56s)]
*  They're not politically or economically doing [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1266.56s)]
*  the things that you think they would do [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1268.56s)]
*  if their goal was ultimately to get the economy hot [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1270.56s)]
*  so that they can have better relationships [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1272.56s)]
*  so that they can have better politics [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1274.9199999999998s)]
*  to pull all the other shenanigans they're trying to pull. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1276.9199999999998s)]

*  that is causing the markets and businesses [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1284.9199999999998s)]
*  to start freaking out a little bit. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1286.9199999999998s)]

*  I'm going to back off, but it didn't really calm things [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1307.28s)]

*  But there is no question, it was just a [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1809.04s)]
*  15 minute tongue bath [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1811.04s)]

*  phrase. That's why I say it. We should feel uncomfortable. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1817.3999999999999s)]

*  I mean frankly I can't believe I'm here [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1823.3999999999999s)]

*  You know how to read [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1827.3999999999999s)]

*  I mean, how are you running [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1837.3999999999999s)]
*  your other businesses? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1839.3999999999999s)]

*  Yeah, I mean, producer's the [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1848.76s)]
*  element to get out. I don't want to end this interview [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1850.76s)]
*  with this too much fun. That question, how are you running [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1852.76s)]
*  your businesses on a day when the Tesla stock [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1854.76s)]
*  is down 15% in Twitter [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1856.76s)]
*  at like a multi-hour outage is actually very funny. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1858.76s)]
*  Elon did seem a little down during the interview. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1860.76s)]
*  He did not seem like this. Yeah, he's on the wrong [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1862.76s)]

*  I know. It's a long way from the chainsaw [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1866.76s)]
*  and the legalized comedy and all that [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1868.76s)]
*  kind of stuff. He was very subdued. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1871.12s)]
*  What happened to the guy that had become meme? [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1873.12s)]
*  You're not looking very become meme, Elon. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1877.12s)]
*  He did try a little bit of [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1879.12s)]
*  memeification at the beginning [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1881.12s)]
*  because little intranet [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1883.12s)]
*  jokes because he was like, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1885.12s)]
*  your businesses have been [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1887.12s)]
*  targeted. There were shots fired [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1889.12s)]
*  at Tesla dealerships and all of a sudden [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1891.12s)]
*  Elon just interrupted him and goes, shots fired. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1893.12s)]
*  But not that. Get it? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1895.12s)]
*  Like on the internet, shots fired. I missed that because [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1897.12s)]
*  I kind of took an Austin sandwich off of his desk. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1899.4799999999998s)]
*  That's why I missed the first few seconds. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1903.4799999999998s)]
*  How fun was that New York [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1905.4799999999998s)]

*  every word of that. First of all, I love that story. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1909.4799999999998s)]
*  Everybody should take a moment and go. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1911.4799999999998s)]

*  There's just one point I wanted to make about the story, which was excellent. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1915.4799999999998s)]
*  It was written in a really strange [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1917.4799999999998s)]
*  way because there's lots of what [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1919.4799999999998s)]
*  seem like direct quotes from [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1921.4799999999998s)]
*  the piece, but they're not in quotes. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1923.4799999999998s)]
*  It's not written like a New York Times story. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1925.4799999999998s)]
*  It's written like a book. It made me think [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1927.84s)]
*  two things. One, could there be? [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1929.84s)]
*  And two, are these people already recording [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1931.84s)]
*  each other? I hope so. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1933.84s)]
*  If I was somebody in that room [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1935.84s)]
*  reading that story, I would be very paranoid [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1937.84s)]
*  about how that story was written [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1939.84s)]
*  basically as if somebody was in [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1941.84s)]
*  the room transcribing it without any [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1943.84s)]
*  reference to a recording or who the [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1945.84s)]
*  There's no like, some sources say [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1947.84s)]
*  Duffy said this and some sources must [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1949.84s)]
*  say that. It is a narrative [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1951.84s)]
*  as if they were in the room. And I just love that for them. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1953.84s)]
*  And for us. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1955.84s)]
*  I'm not clear why. He doesn't have like big ideas [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1986.1999999999998s)]
*  he's trying to put forward, but he wanted to be president. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1988.1999999999998s)]
*  Now he has like the big time [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1990.1999999999998s)]
*  cabinet job, right? It's like top three. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1992.1999999999998s)]
*  State, Treasury, Defense. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1994.1999999999998s)]
*  And he's still getting kicked around by Elon Musk. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1996.1999999999998s)]
*  And then even his own team. Remember a couple [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=1998.1999999999998s)]
*  of months ago, we learned that his [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2000.1999999999998s)]
*  spokeswoman had talked shit about him on Twitter. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2002.1999999999998s)]
*  And he had to hire her anyway. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2004.1999999999998s)]
*  Then there was a story over the weekend, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2006.1999999999998s)]
*  CNN reported that the undersecretary [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2008.1999999999998s)]

*  status and accused him of going to gay [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2014.56s)]
*  foam parties. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2016.56s)]
*  This guy still works at the State Department? [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2018.56s)]
*  There was a moment, people just need to understand [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2020.56s)]
*  there was this brief frenzy on the [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2022.56s)]
*  internet that Marco Rubio had [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2024.56s)]
*  attended gay sex parties. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2026.56s)]

*  Foam parties. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2030.56s)]
*  There's a picture of him with [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2032.56s)]
*  foam around him and some men [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2034.56s)]
*  and apparently there was just a regular foam party [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2036.56s)]
*  and they just tried to insinuate it. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2038.56s)]
*  Foam parties are disgusting. Yeah they are. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2040.56s)]
*  dirty in seconds. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2042.56s)]
*  No one needs to be at a phone party. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2043.56s)]
*  Look, this is an episode about freedom and not judging, not yucking other people's yum. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2044.56s)]
*  Go anywhere you want. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2049.68s)]
*  Whether it be a phone party or an anti-Israel protest. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2050.68s)]
*  Regardless, whether or not he was at a phone party, then he gets attacked in this meeting [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2052.88s)]
*  in front of the entire cabinet by Elon, accused of not doing anything, and then Monday morning [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2057.92s)]
*  he has to send out the tweets like, I'm a good boy and I did what I'm told and I cancelled [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2061.92s)]
*  83% of the programs at USAID, but the remaining 18% get transferred to state, which that math [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2065.2799999999997s)]
*  does not add up. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2070.64s)]
*  I think that our Secretary of State is the result of an elaborate prank that the whole [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2071.64s)]
*  Trump maga world has been playing on him. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2078.7599999999998s)]
*  We're going to make him Secretary of State, we're going to make him think he's got a big [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2080.92s)]
*  job now, and then we're going to put all the people who hate him as his staff, and then [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2084.7999999999997s)]
*  we're going to sic Elon Musk on him. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2089.4s)]
*  We're going to make him prom king and he's going to walk out on that stage, pig's blood. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2091.68s)]
*  I feel like we are not even at the beginning of the humiliation of Marco Rubio. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2096.64s)]
*  You know, people made this point, somebody on social media was making this point, and [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2101.12s)]
*  I'm sorry to whoever it was, that both JD Vance and Marco Rubio have fundamentally changed [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2105.88s)]
*  their worldview to fit with Donald Trump, but JD Vance does it in such a convincing [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2111.16s)]
*  way, and Marco Rubio just can't, and he can't because you can just see it in his eyes, the [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2115.44s)]
*  person in there that doesn't agree, he can't kill that part of himself, and I don't know [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2123.92s)]
*  if that speaks well of him or poorly of him, but I'm loving every second of it. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2127.7599999999998s)]
*  My view on this is that, and I've changed my view over time, I think JD Vance believes [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2130.92s)]
*  it. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2134.56s)]
*  I think JD Vance is entirely bought in, and he's got all the authoritarian tendencies, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2135.56s)]
*  he loves Orban and Hungry and all the rest of it, he's part of the project. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2140.76s)]
*  I do think that with Vance, there's this sort of great salesman quality that he has. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2147.84s)]
*  He always has this tone in interviews, like, I don't understand how anyone could be so [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2153.5s)]
*  understand why we are right, and he was doing it about why the mineral deal in Ukraine weighed [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2158.64s)]
*  more, he got in trouble for it, of course it's crazy, he got in trouble for saying, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2163.08s)]
*  for insulting French and British troops, but the point he was making was such a strident [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2167.0s)]
*  arrogance. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2171.2s)]
*  You can tell he used to be an establishment cook because he's very scoldy. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2172.2s)]
*  The need for rare earth minerals has prevented conflicts in the Congo for decades now, there's [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2177.16s)]
*  never been a war in the Congo because of the rare earths that we mine there. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2182.3599999999997s)]
*  But I always just, I think he's a salesman at heart, selling, and I think he, like any [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2186.04s)]
*  great salesman, he sells himself first, and so I do think he starts to really adapt these [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2191.32s)]
*  views. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2195.4s)]
*  There's this clip of Rubio from 2016 going around. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2196.4s)]
*  He's running for president, so no matter what he won't be a dictator unless our republic [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2198.56s)]
*  completely crumbles, which I don't anticipate it will. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2201.72s)]
*  And if you listen to the way he describes himself and what he's going to do, he's going [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2204.2799999999997s)]
*  to single-handedly do this and do that without regard for whether it's legal or not. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2208.12s)]
*  No matter what happens in this election, for years to come, there are many people on the [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2212.36s)]
*  right in the media and voters at large that are going to be having to explain and justify [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2216.6800000000003s)]
*  how they fell into this trap of supporting Donald Trump, because this is not going to [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2221.6400000000003s)]
*  end well one way or the other. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2225.52s)]
*  How great was that, everyone? [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2226.96s)]
*  Also, I just wanted, I don't know that people realize, Tesla's stock is down 50% in the [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2227.96s)]
*  last three months. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2233.32s)]
*  By the dip? [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2234.76s)]
*  Went from a $1.5 trillion market cap to less than $700 million. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2235.76s)]
*  It's because Elon's like, he's a master at manipulating the stock market. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2241.32s)]
*  It is all smoke and mirrors. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2245.36s)]
*  It is not revenue. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2246.56s)]
*  It's him trying to convince investors that he's going to sell the next fleet of robotaxis [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2247.56s)]
*  and autonomous robots and stuff. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2251.96s)]
*  That's bullshit. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2253.88s)]
*  And I'll just say this, that I don't let Cybertrucks in. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2254.88s)]
*  I just don't let them in. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2258.2400000000002s)]
*  Into work. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2259.2400000000002s)]
*  Into my lane. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2260.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm not kind to the Cybertrucks on the road. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2261.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't break any rules. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2263.6000000000004s)]
*  You used to own one. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2264.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, what happened to that? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2265.6000000000004s)]
*  I had a Tesla. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2266.6000000000004s)]
*  You owned a Cybertruck. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2267.6000000000004s)]
*  For the Cybertruck, yeah. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2268.6000000000004s)]
*  Yes, of course I did. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2269.6000000000004s)]
*  Of course I did. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2270.88s)]
*  Of course I also have a Cybertruck. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2271.88s)]
*  Until Tommy and I put graffiti on it. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2272.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2274.36s)]
*  Well, it couldn't fit in our compact spaces. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2275.36s)]
*  So I had to get rid of my Cybertruck. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2276.36s)]
*  You guys ought to know that John, Tommy and I, we park in these three tiny fucking spaces [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2279.36s)]
*  and every morning someone comes in and is like, hey, hey, too close. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2283.7599999999998s)]
*  Too fucking close. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2288.4s)]
*  And you're like, I thought I parked. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2289.4s)]
*  No, you got to park a little bit further because I couldn't get in the fucking car. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2290.4s)]
*  Tommy leveled an accusation once and I actually, when I went out to get coffee, I took a picture [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2293.52s)]
*  just to prove that I had actually parked far, far away from the line. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2298.24s)]
*  You digging in and doing well, actually. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2301.88s)]
*  I just want to say that we've been together longer than the Beatles. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2302.88s)]
*  Maybe one serious discussion in this section before we start. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2305.88s)]
*  So Jeff Stein and Dan Diamond had a good piece in the Washington Post. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2312.88s)]
*  Not as gossipy as Maggie and Jonathan's, but a good piece. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2316.0s)]
*  Good reporters. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2318.72s)]
*  It was good. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2319.72s)]
*  They made the case that Trump actually does appear to be susceptible to political pressure [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2320.72s)]
*  on things like tariffs and doge cuts. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2324.16s)]
*  He's knocked back the tariffs now a couple of times. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2327.12s)]
*  He has now reigned in Elon a little bit. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2329.2s)]
*  What do you guys think? [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2332.88s)]
*  Do you think that this is him feeling some political pressure? [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2333.88s)]
*  Do you think it's something else? [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2337.56s)]
*  No, I think he does. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2338.56s)]
*  I think he actually does. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2340.04s)]
*  I think he's hearing it. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2341.04s)]
*  I don't think he bases political pressure and that he cares about blowback in the mainstream [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2342.04s)]
*  press. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2346.7599999999998s)]
*  I think he hears it from the congressional Republicans. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2347.7599999999998s)]
*  And I think behind closed doors, there are more honest conversations with Mike Johnson, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2350.4s)]
*  about what they're hearing and where it's like, hey, man, they're like kind of the kind [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2356.1600000000003s)]
*  of thing that's like, hey, man, they're with you, but you got to give them this or you [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2359.28s)]
*  got to you got to slow down on this or I'm getting a lot of shit about this, whatever [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2362.2400000000002s)]
*  it may be. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2364.92s)]
*  Because I think actually where the political pressure is right now, like really does boil [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2365.92s)]
*  down to whatever happens. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2370.04s)]
*  Yes, with the CR that's coming, but ultimately with reconciliation and whether or not they [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2371.2400000000002s)]
*  can get a all Republican bill through the House and the economy is going down. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2374.96s)]
*  If there's a bunch of blowback around Medicaid cuts, all of a sudden, planes are going down. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2380.4s)]
*  Planes are continue to touch. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2384.4s)]
*  Which they're never supposed to do. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2386.0s)]
*  They're bumping. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2390.92s)]
*  Then all of a sudden, they're not able to count to a majority in the House and his whole [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2391.92s)]
*  agenda is in jeopardy. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2395.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we're tariffing Canada, one of our closest allies over a completely made [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2396.92s)]
*  up fentanyl trafficking problem. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2401.08s)]
*  Someone at the White House has to just be like, what are we doing here? [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2403.36s)]
*  Because as you pointed out, I mean, he does need the political capital to get these things, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2405.6400000000003s)]
*  this tax cut through Congress. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2409.28s)]
*  And it just doesn't look good right now. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2411.84s)]
*  He also likes being liked. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2414.24s)]
*  That's like his big... [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2416.72s)]
*  He's a narcissist. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2417.72s)]
*  He's important and he is, I think, more self-aware than he lets on. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2418.72s)]
*  And he knows the stock market's been terrible. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2422.4399999999996s)]
*  He watches the TV and so he knows what's going on and I think he does not want to be hated. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2427.04s)]
*  Yeah, the deal was like, we'll give you money, you give us a tax cut for all his donors. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2433.12s)]
*  They can't be happy right now. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2437.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2438.8399999999997s)]
*  All right, let's talk about what Americans really care about. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2439.8399999999997s)]
*  So the looming government shutdown can be averted. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2443.52s)]
*  On Saturday, Speaker Mike Johnson put out the text of the continuing resolution he's [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2446.44s)]
*  going to bring to a vote Tuesday night. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2449.48s)]
*  It turns out it's not exactly a clean continuing resolution as promised. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2452.0800000000004s)]
*  It increases spending on things like defense and border enforcement while cutting spending [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2456.7200000000003s)]
*  by greater amounts in other areas, including zeroing out a lot of healthcare programs in [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2460.9s)]
*  states. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2465.28s)]
*  Trump is whipping support for this one. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2466.6800000000003s)]
*  He wrote on Truth Social. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2468.5600000000004s)]
*  All Republicans should vote in parentheses, please exclamation point. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2469.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2474.64s)]
*  Next week. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2475.64s)]
*  So far we've only got one Republican hard no from Thomas Massey. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2477.7200000000003s)]
*  If that holds, this thing will pass the House. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2481.18s)]
*  Big if. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2483.36s)]
*  Then it will go to the Senate where the funding bill can't pass without support from at least [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2484.36s)]
*  seven Democratic senators and probably eight since Rand Paul seems like a no. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2488.36s)]
*  Democratic leaders say this is a power grab by the White House and a quote slush fund [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2494.32s)]
*  for Trump and Musk. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2497.64s)]
*  What do you think they mean by that? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2499.3199999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump is treating every dollar Congress has ever appropriated as money he can decide [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2500.3199999999997s)]
*  whether to spend or not. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2505.0s)]
*  Republicans have acted as though putting into the law controls on what Trump does to protect [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2507.16s)]
*  Congress's authority under the Constitution is like like like so unacceptable. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2513.48s)]
*  So yeah, I mean, if we if Donald Trump believes he can just cut or spend however he sees fit, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2519.64s)]
*  then we're no longer appropriating money for the administrative branch. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2524.0s)]
*  So our pal, Alyssa Slotkin, the fairly moderate new Democratic senator for Michigan, said [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2528.56s)]
*  on Sunday that she's withholding her vote to fund the government until Congress gets [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2535.64s)]
*  quote assurances that the administration will actually follow the law and spending the money [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2539.04s)]
*  so it's not a slush fund. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2543.64s)]
*  That seems to me like Senate Democrats might actually be willing to vote down this funding [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2546.3199999999997s)]
*  bill. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2549.92s)]
*  Though then they asked Mark Kelly and he was sort of saying what's lock and said, but then [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2550.92s)]
*  he was like, but shutdowns are bad. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2554.8399999999997s)]
*  We don't like shutdowns and the CR isn't great, but shutdowns are bad, too. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2557.4s)]
*  Tommy, what do you think? [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2560.28s)]
*  Is this can you see a possible compromise here? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2561.28s)]
*  Is this a good idea to go forward and withhold votes? [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2564.24s)]
*  Bad idea. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2566.76s)]
*  I mean, I think Lovett's point is the important one. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2567.76s)]
*  Like Congress's position sort of has to be if you want to cut spending, we will write [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2568.92s)]
*  a bill. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2572.66s)]
*  Otherwise, we shouldn't exist anymore. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2573.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2575.0s)]
*  So I don't like I also think I think Democrats should approach this with some confidence [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2576.0s)]
*  because Trump does not want a shutdown right now. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2581.56s)]
*  The economy is very shaky. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2583.92s)]
*  People are wondering what he's doing. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2585.84s)]
*  Like the people like voters know Republicans control everything. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2587.6000000000004s)]
*  I don't like shutdown politics are complicated. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2591.08s)]
*  It's especially complicated when you have Elon Musk controlling the most powerful piece [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2593.52s)]
*  of social media with X and the ability to blame Democrats. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2598.1600000000003s)]
*  It'll get rocky. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2602.08s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2603.08s)]
*  Like I would demand something at the very least. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2604.82s)]
*  And I think saying, yeah, you have to follow the law and actually appropriate money where [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2607.6400000000003s)]
*  we say is pretty important. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2611.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I feel like I talked about this on too many episodes. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2613.56s)]
*  But you know, Dan has made the point like, know what you're asking for. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2616.7200000000003s)]
*  Ask for something. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2621.08s)]
*  If you're going to go through this and like make it specific, make it clear, make it under, [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2622.6s)]
*  you know, and look, will they if you get it, are they going to abide by it? [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2625.52s)]
*  Who the fuck knows? [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2630.08s)]
*  But if we're going by what they're going to abide by or not abide by, then we might as [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2632.0s)]
*  well just give up. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2635.64s)]
*  You're right. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2636.64s)]
*  Then there's then there's no Congress. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2637.64s)]
*  We might as well. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2638.64s)]
*  We're afraid of the politics of what happens when Donald Trump doesn't follow the law. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2639.64s)]
*  We've lost already. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2641.64s)]
*  We're fair. We're afraid of the politics. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2642.72s)]
*  If Donald Trump does follow a law. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2644.4s)]
*  Well, that's ordinary politics we've done a million times. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2645.7599999999998s)]
*  And then if they need our votes to pass something, then you should get something for your votes. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2648.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Right. Like they're going to do what they would have done if they had a 60 seat [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2651.7999999999997s)]
*  majority. Well, that doesn't make sense. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2655.44s)]
*  Yeah. Don't be scared about the midterms now. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2656.8799999999997s)]
*  God's sake. No, that I would not do something. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2659.2s)]
*  So, of course, government funding isn't the only thing Democrats are arguing about. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2662.8799999999997s)]
*  Excellent Wall Street Journal headline here. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2666.3199999999997s)]
*  Democrats are busy fighting over what to fight over [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2668.48s)]
*  on their list, whether it was good or bad to interrupt Trump in his joint address and [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2671.92s)]
*  whether we should be blowing up members phones and town halls to get them to fight the [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2676.28s)]
*  Doge cuts. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2680.0s)]
*  Tim Walz was also out there this weekend saying that the Harris campaign played it too safe [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2681.28s)]
*  during the campaign and should have done more town halls where they got tough questions. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2685.56s)]
*  For good measure, we also had a bunch of stories over the weekend about Democrats starting [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2690.2400000000002s)]
*  to swear more, talk more about sports and podcast more, which of course we love. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2694.72s)]
*  Yeah. How about football? [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2700.04s)]
*  You like? I'm starting a new podcast where I talk about football. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2702.16s)]
*  Football Good Pod. You fuckers. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2705.48s)]
*  Fuckers. How are you guys feeling about the party's very public therapy session slash [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2708.16s)]
*  nervous breakdown? [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2713.2799999999997s)]
*  Part for the course, huh? [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2715.3999999999996s)]
*  It's sort of like, hey, everybody, just stop. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2717.12s)]
*  Do less. Remember that from Forgetting Sarah Marshall? [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2722.0s)]
*  Do less. Just do less. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2724.12s)]
*  I guess I'd like a little bit more, a little less discussion of the strategy types that [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2726.08s)]
*  are available to us and a little bit more of if you think this is what we should do, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2732.72s)]
*  why don't you do that? [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2736.16s)]
*  And if you think there's something else we should do, you do that. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2737.08s)]
*  And then we'll just take a look at it. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2739.24s)]
*  Let's just throw some spaghetti against the wall. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2741.72s)]
*  You know, and if that spaghetti looks like a years old trend on TikTok, the choose your [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2744.0s)]
*  fighter thing. I love that. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2748.3599999999997s)]
*  I didn't love that. But it's like, I don't think Democrats have paid too great a price [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2749.96s)]
*  for Al Green going, meh. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2753.24s)]
*  And like, I don't you know, but I but I and like, I don't think that color coordination [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2755.04s)]
*  was particularly effective. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2758.4799999999996s)]
*  Yep. Look, most protests aren't popular in the moment, so you can disagree with Al Green's [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2759.8799999999997s)]
*  tactic. But at least he had a focus message that was about Medicaid cuts. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2763.68s)]
*  I like that better than like holding a silly like kind of cutesy. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2766.6s)]
*  I think that was always destined to look silly. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2769.4799999999996s)]
*  I think if you look at the Senate, Cory Booker, Brian Schatz, Chris Murphy, there's a [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2771.68s)]
*  lot of people just like putting shots on goal, making a lot of content, putting stuff on [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2777.68s)]
*  TikTok, putting up videos. I think that's the right way to go. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2781.44s)]
*  Tim Walz is right. They did play too safe. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2785.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, I remember when he was named as vice president, I was really excited to hear him [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2787.48s)]
*  do a bunch of interviews and then he was bottled up for half the campaign. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2790.32s)]
*  And that was obviously a mistake. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2794.0s)]
*  Yeah. The the the being afraid of taking on some of the more controversial [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2796.08s)]
*  like policy issues that the Trump the Trump campaign was making big under the assumption [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2802.04s)]
*  that under the hope that you ignore that you push that down, you campaign in your most [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2806.52s)]
*  effective on your most effective messages. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2810.12s)]
*  That was like a smarter, safer thing to do. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2812.2s)]
*  Like it turns out that didn't work. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2814.08s)]
*  Was that the wrong decision at the time? [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2815.64s)]
*  I don't know. But like right now, like there's a I feel like in that piece, like there's [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2817.24s)]
*  a lot of like abstraction and like I don't sometimes I don't know what is fighting [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2821.7999999999997s)]
*  voting against the CR is fighting voting for it, but being angry like like sometimes [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2825.68s)]
*  like very confi but only but focusing on reconciliation. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2829.8399999999997s)]
*  Like what like I don't often know how to apply the abstraction. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2832.4s)]
*  But like the core point, one of the core points made in the piece is there are some more [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2835.6s)]
*  moderates that are basically saying our constituents that we need, our moderate constituents [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2840.32s)]
*  need to think of us as even killed fighters who will work with Trump sometimes and oppose [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2844.2799999999997s)]
*  him where he's wrong. Well, there's the well, just like trying to make the most generous [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2848.96s)]
*  version of it. And then but the left says Trump is threatening the republic. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2852.56s)]
*  We need to fight these people at every turn. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2856.56s)]
*  And by the way, that will bring out the people we need when they see us becoming champions [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2858.24s)]
*  for them in the working class. And that means that means giving no quarter and and trying [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2862.04s)]
*  to stop every one of these doge cuts, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2867.72s)]
*  And like I think probably that may make sense in Tom Swazee's district, but not make sense [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2869.84s)]
*  for others and not make sense for the party as a whole. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2874.24s)]
*  I don't know. I think there's been it's odd to say this as the founders of a media company [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2875.84s)]
*  here. There's been a bit too much focus on like what mediums and formats to communicate [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2881.56s)]
*  and get the message out. And like I get it. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2889.2s)]
*  You know, it's a it's a crazy media environment right now. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2892.8399999999997s)]
*  And you can't do just television anymore and put out a press release. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2896.2s)]
*  Right. We've talked about that a million times. But like there should be a little more focus [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2899.3599999999997s)]
*  on just be yourself, you know, do what's comfortable to you in your own skin. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2903.44s)]
*  And then the fact that you have to do it on a new medium. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2907.92s)]
*  Right. Like you have to be on TikTok or you have to do a podcast like that shouldn't change [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2910.64s)]
*  your style, your message, who you are. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2915.3199999999997s)]
*  Like, I feel like there's a lot of people trying to fit themselves in like boxes that they [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2918.52s)]
*  don't really belong in just because either their younger staff or consultants or anyone [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2923.64s)]
*  else is telling them like, this is what's cool. This is what you got to do. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2930.28s)]
*  Like you just just be yourself. Boxes of vertical video. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2932.64s)]
*  Yeah. You don't have to do like a trending meme. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2935.32s)]
*  That's silly. Just talk. But I do think it's good to get out there. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2937.88s)]
*  I mean, apparently, apparently, House members are mad. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2940.32s)]
*  They were told not to applaud at the State of the Union. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2942.28s)]
*  And if that's the case, that was bad advice, because like every president ever who delivers [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2944.56s)]
*  the State of the Union creates a trap for you if you do that by introducing some really [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2949.52s)]
*  emotional story where clearly everyone should be applauding. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2954.84s)]
*  And if you're sitting on your hands, you look bad. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2957.56s)]
*  But I don't think it doesn't matter. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2960.28s)]
*  Like that's where like we're like, do we applaud or not applaud? [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2961.88s)]
*  Like, why is that even? It's just a silly thing. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2965.76s)]
*  The media focuses. No, I know. But what I'm getting there's like it's like all of this [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2967.84s)]
*  feels like it's trying to make up for some deeper problem, which is about like, what [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2971.16s)]
*  do we stand for? Why don't people believe us? [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2975.2799999999997s)]
*  How do we like there's a kind of bigger problem inside of like democratic politics [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2977.52s)]
*  that we all on some level know and we're sort of grappling with. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2982.8399999999997s)]
*  And like in the short term, like no one's going to solve it. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2987.12s)]
*  It's going to take a lot of time. Well, again, elections will come and you need to [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2988.96s)]
*  strategize around an election and figure out what the best measures are for like the next [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2993.8399999999997s)]
*  for at least this year. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2997.68s)]
*  Just do your politics like you're not going to look at the reaction or you're not going [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=2999.16s)]
*  to read advice. You're just doing it based on what you think and believe and and how [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3003.2s)]
*  you feel about things. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3008.48s)]
*  Try that for it. Just try it for a little bit. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3009.96s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, sure. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3011.7599999999998s)]
*  It'll work for some people and some people won't work for and then, you know, get a job. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3014.04s)]
*  Well, the like politics like no one is watching. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3019.52s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. That's like no one's watching politics like no one is watching. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3021.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Posts like you've never heard. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3025.04s)]
*  No one is. Yeah, no one is. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3026.36s)]
*  Here's the thing for most people. Nobody is. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3028.32s)]
*  Yeah. Like we, you know, you go to that like if a podcast, [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3030.2400000000002s)]
*  the podcast dropped on a feed and no one heard it, did it really did it really make it? [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3034.96s)]
*  Did those did those three guys say anything? [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3038.2400000000002s)]
*  Did those three guys say anything? [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3041.84s)]
*  Yes. My answer is yes. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3043.92s)]
*  That was a draft version of the title. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3046.32s)]
*  Yeah. But like, you know, I saw the difference between like there there was like this [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3047.88s)]
*  whole I like I posted a picture of the Bernie rally and said like I thought this was [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3054.04s)]
*  inspiring because it generally was. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3059.72s)]
*  I saw you quote, Tweeted and I was like, oh, he must be shadow boxing as mentions on [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3061.24s)]
*  this one. You bet I was. You bet. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3064.2s)]
*  Not shadow boxing boxing. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3065.8s)]
*  But there's every reply under the book in the sun to explain why it wasn't actually [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3068.44s)]
*  inspiring and actually quite bad. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3074.24s)]
*  What? Yeah. Just sort of like why is Bernie alone? [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3076.52s)]
*  Why aren't other Democrats doing this? [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3080.08s)]
*  Bernie's too old. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3082.08s)]
*  Why isn't he with somebody else? [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3083.16s)]
*  This isn't. Sometimes I feel like we're running a political campaign with five thousand [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3084.64s)]
*  people who all have an equal say in the campaign all the time and they're all strategists. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3089.12s)]
*  But the thing about it online, but the thing about it is like there was none of that [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3093.8799999999997s)]
*  feeling in the actual event. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3098.16s)]
*  Because it's real life. And in real life, what was there at that event? [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3100.96s)]
*  There were it was it was very diverse age, all demographics. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3103.64s)]
*  And there are people there that have been Bernie fans forever. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3109.12s)]
*  There are people there that had never been to a political rally before. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3111.4s)]
*  They're all very excited to be there. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3113.76s)]
*  They weren't checking to find out how long they'd been a Bernie backer of any Pete [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3115.36s)]
*  Buttigieg supporters and managed to sneak in. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3119.36s)]
*  Right. Like none of that exists in the real world. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3121.6400000000003s)]
*  Right. There's nobody like, oh, you're Bernie. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3124.44s)]
*  Do I hear high hopes in the background? [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3126.8s)]
*  You're Bernie now. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3128.52s)]
*  But you you you were part of the DNC coup in Iowa in 2016. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3130.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's what we were. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3135.1600000000003s)]
*  People who are early into a band who scold you if you come to it later is like, it's [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3136.6800000000003s)]
*  not fun. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3139.88s)]
*  Right. Like the two things can't be the two positions can't be. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3140.2s)]
*  Why isn't the Democratic Party embracing Bernie's message? [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3144.0s)]
*  And oh, sure. You like Bernie now. Where were you before? [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3146.52s)]
*  It's like, well, those two things are in opposition. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3149.3599999999997s)]
*  Some of my sometimes our leftist friends don't build the biggest tent and we all [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3151.04s)]
*  should just welcome people into the Bernie Club. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3154.0s)]
*  I think there's like two competing things that are in my mind. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3155.56s)]
*  Like, first of all, in Congress, obstruction works. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3157.68s)]
*  Mitch McConnell built a whole career off it. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3159.72s)]
*  So let's just obstruct everything Trump does and try to prevent harm. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3161.24s)]
*  Then there's the other piece of this, which is like people are looking for [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3164.16s)]
*  something to be for and some sort of inspiration. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3166.72s)]
*  When I talked to Alastair Campbell for the Sunday pod, he was Tony Blair's guy. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3169.08s)]
*  And one thing they did before Tony Blair became prime minister was they like they [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3172.88s)]
*  literally had a big contentious debate about the constitution of the Labor Party, [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3177.08s)]
*  like the the DNA of it. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3181.2000000000003s)]
*  They had a huge contentious fight, like ripped it down to the studs and tried to [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3183.0s)]
*  reimagine it. And I think the Democrats were missing that process. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3186.2000000000003s)]
*  And it probably won't come until we have a nominee ahead of the twenty twenty eight [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3189.88s)]
*  primaries, because, you know, whoever is the top of the ticket kind of reshapes the [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3193.76s)]
*  party around him or herself. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3197.16s)]
*  But I think we're missing some of that. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3199.0s)]
*  We're missing a process to kind of like reimagine who we are and our brand and our [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3200.56s)]
*  values and then project it outwards. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3205.24s)]
*  I also I agree with that. I also think there's like I'm watching [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3206.96s)]
*  The Real Housewives from the beginning, a lot of them. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3211.68s)]
*  And honestly, everybody was right. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3214.44s)]
*  I can't believe I waited this long. It's a dream. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3216.68s)]

*  But some nodding heads over there. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3221.72s)]
*  But there was a moment during a reunion where [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3225.2799999999997s)]
*  Andy, the reunion episodes are the best. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3228.9199999999996s)]

*  I bet you'll got more money after that. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3239.52s)]
*  And I just like there's a there's a downside to Democrats constantly [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3242.08s)]
*  hand wringing in public about how terrified they are of looking like they're obstinate [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3245.68s)]
*  or like worrying about how they need to show that they that they're some of their [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3249.3999999999996s)]
*  constituents want them to kind of coordinate with Trump and not be so opposed to him while opposing the bad parts. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3253.36s)]
*  Is it sends a message that they're that they're fucking that they'll that they'll that they'll bend, [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3257.8s)]
*  that they'll give up. And if like Democrats were a little bit more like we will support [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3262.1600000000003s)]

*  the resolution cards a little closer to the best. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3269.6400000000003s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. Like like just there's a just like Trump is a negotiator. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3272.52s)]
*  He's not a very good one, but he thinks about it. He cares about it. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3276.52s)]
*  And it's like maybe like think about that a little bit. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3278.8s)]
*  But also good for Bernie for filling a space and like getting giving people a place to go to get excited and fired up. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3281.6s)]
*  Well, I think that's in house districts that that Republicans won by only a few votes. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3287.2400000000002s)]
*  More Democrats should be doing absolutely. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3291.2000000000003s)]
*  Whether you whether you like Bernie's politics or not, there here's a guy who has not changed anything about himself [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3292.7200000000003s)]

*  Mr. Musk, Mr. Bezos, Mr. Zuckerberg, and then sitting scattered throughout the stage, [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3655.16s)]
*  13 other billionaires who Trump nominated to head major agencies, secretary of treasury, et cetera, you tell me what you would call it. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3662.76s)]
*  This is I find it hard not to describe it as a government of the billionaires. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3671.88s)]
*  And that is what oligarchy is about. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3678.0s)]
*  There's this you made this video after like, I think, two weeks into Trump's term. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3680.1600000000003s)]
*  And it's really meaningful for me just personally, because I found it very helpful to think about how to fight back. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3686.56s)]
*  You talked about needing to define what's happening, needing to fight back in the short term and then needing to build a progressive movement and agenda in the long term. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3693.12s)]
*  But there was also like a there was a gravity in your voice and a sense that in a way that I maybe hadn't heard before. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3700.24s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know if you agree with that. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3706.3199999999997s)]
*  These are the scariest times in my lifetime. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3708.2s)]
*  That's all I mean, I think that's objectively the truth. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3711.9599999999996s)]
*  You know, it is not just they want to give tax breaks to billionaires and cut programs for working people. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3716.3599999999997s)]
*  Frankly, that's happened before. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3721.32s)]
*  But you combine that with the power of the oligarchy in general, you combine that with Mr. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3723.76s)]
*  Musk owning Twitter and able to send out his messages to hundreds of millions of people. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3732.8s)]
*  You combine that with the fact that people like Bezos, the second wealthiest person in the country, fired or got rid of most of his editorial staff and is going to convert him into a right wing thing. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3739.36s)]
*  Combine that with the fact that Trump is suing major media outlets and is threatening to investigate PBS and NPR. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3751.24s)]
*  So it's not only the power of money, it's also combined with that, the movement toward authoritarianism. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3760.8799999999997s)]
*  You know, when Trump unilaterally cuts federal funding that was passed by Congress, that is illegal. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3767.2s)]
*  That is unconstitutional. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3775.4399999999996s)]
*  When you have the vice president saying, well, in his judgment, the courts don't have the right to stop unconstitutional acts of the president, man, that is authoritarianism. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3777.96s)]
*  That's what the courts are. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3789.7200000000003s)]
*  He is now trying to end what the founding fathers were pretty smart about, creating a form of government where there were checks and balances, you know, a legislative body, an executive body and a judiciary. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3790.7200000000003s)]
*  So he's moving aggressively in all of these areas. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3803.6s)]
*  Yeah, there was gravity in my voice. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3806.52s)]
*  This is a scary moment. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3808.28s)]
*  There is strange contradiction in fighting back because on the one hand, you have the kind of brazenness of what Trump Trump is doing, as if he won't ever have to worry about democratic legitimacy at all, that they're not worried about being held accountable or they're not worried about people paying attention. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3810.04s)]
*  They're not worried about what could happen. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3828.0s)]
*  But then we're here in a district that Republican won by a few points. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3830.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3834.36s)]
*  These people still care about their jobs. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3834.92s)]
*  Right. This is a place where normal politics just seems still be possible to practice. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3837.08s)]
*  And I'm just curious how you think about that, that on the one hand, we're facing this unprecedented brazen power grab by the richest human beings in the history of planet Earth. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3841.8s)]
*  And on the other, we've got to knock on doors and turn people out to win by a few hundred, maybe a thousand votes in a district like this. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3850.8s)]
*  Well, I think this is what I believe. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3857.96s)]
*  Maybe I'm wrong, but it is what I have always believed. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3861.36s)]
*  And I am a politician, you know, and when people stand up and talk, when your phone line bangs off the hook, when you see rallies, if I'm the congressman from this district and I see 9000 people coming out who really do not want tax breaks for billionaires and cuts in Medicaid, you know what? [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3864.6s)]
*  I'm going to think twice about it. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3883.36s)]
*  So I think what Trump and Musk hope is they can create a sense of powerlessness in people. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3885.24s)]
*  Hey, what do you think? I got all the money. I got all the power. I own the media. I can buy elections. What do you think you can do? You can't fathom me. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3893.16s)]
*  And if people believe that, we're going to lose. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3900.2s)]
*  But if people understand that when they stand up and fight back, and that's why at the end of these remarks, I talked about the history of this country. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3902.52s)]
*  This is not the first time, you know, I think back, slightly different thing, you know, in December of 41, 1941, the United States was attacked at Pearl Harbor. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3908.64s)]
*  You know what? [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3917.7999999999997s)]
*  We have to fight a war on two fronts. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3918.92s)]
*  Complete. The military was not prepared to do that. Yet in two years, the country came together. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3921.8s)]
*  We were able to, you know, lay the groundwork for victory. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3926.12s)]
*  We can do it. We can do it when people are mobilized and are prepared to stand up and fight back. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3930.32s)]
*  So what does success to you look like in the short term? [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3935.4s)]
*  In the short term, it means a solid defeat of this outrageous reconciliation bill, which would provide one point one trillion dollars in tax breaks to the one percent. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3939.44s)]
*  And massive cuts to Medicaid nutrition and education programs. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3949.52s)]
*  That's the immediate. We win that. We got them on the defensive. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3953.56s)]
*  And that's what why I'm here in this district and why I was in Kenosha and Altoona earlier. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3956.48s)]
*  What is that? What does that argue for doing in this? [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3962.48s)]
*  Even before we get to that reconciliation vote, because right now they're trying to jam through this continuing resolution just to keep the government open, to give them time to negotiate with each other to figure out their tax cuts and Medicaid cuts. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3965.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, I'll be back in Washington on Monday and we'll be delving into that. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3978.96s)]
*  But there's a lot of stuff that's flying on. So I can't give you a good answer on that one. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3982.88s)]
*  You know, I remember when the Bush tax cuts. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3987.56s)]
*  Were on the table and they talked about starving the beast, sure you remember. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3991.48s)]
*  And but but the reason they said that is they were kind of attenuating the connection between massive tax cuts for the richest people. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=3998.08s)]
*  And inevitably what they would try to do next, which was privatizing Social Security, cutting health care. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4005.6s)]
*  They understood that there was like a political risk in doing that. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4010.16s)]
*  Can you remember a time when you have had at the exact same moment an active proposal to cut one trillion dollars worth of taxes for the richest people to give people making over a million dollars an average of seventy thousand dollars just in cash money while also firing eighty thousand people for the Veterans Affairs? [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4012.8399999999997s)]
*  No, this is unprecedented. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4031.08s)]
*  And it's why this is a scary moment. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4033.6s)]
*  Look, Musk is many things, but he is extraordinarily arrogant and extraordinarily aggressive. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4035.3199999999997s)]
*  And they're going for it. They're going for it. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4044.92s)]
*  I mean, it's just hard to keep up with what they are doing, their movie. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4046.72s)]
*  And that's not an accident as well. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4049.44s)]
*  But I tell you, I think that when you propose to cut was it eighty three thousand positions at the Veterans Administration, the American people are going to say you're not going to do that because no matter what your politics may be, there is respect for people who put their lives on the line to defend our country. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4052.56s)]
*  And I've been talking to veterans all over this country. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4074.96s)]
*  And you know what? [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4077.8799999999997s)]
*  I don't think they're going to get away with that. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4078.7999999999997s)]
*  I think the veterans community is going to stand up and they can have seniors all over this country saying, no, I can't get a phone call now because the Social Security Administration is understaffed. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4080.2799999999997s)]
*  Some thirty thousand people a year die who have disabilities because they don't get their benefits on time. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4091.68s)]
*  This will only make it much worse. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4097.8s)]
*  So there was a there was a report out of the Times about basically a fight in the cabinet room or in a cabinet meeting between Musk and Rubio and Duffy and Trump and all these characters because they're feeling the political consequences of the attention on long hold times. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4099.2s)]
*  People just trying to find out what happened to their Social Security checks or veterans being laid off. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4117.12s)]
*  Most of the 25 percent of people that work at VA are veterans, so they are firing veterans who take care of veterans. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4120.88s)]
*  I can't think of a less popular. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4125.6s)]
*  You got it. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4127.76s)]
*  Decision. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4129.24s)]
*  What is there? [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4131.72s)]
*  Is there any hope in the pressure that you that's taking place inside of the Trump administration? [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4133.92s)]
*  I know we want to beat these people, but in the meantime, we got to we got to figure out anything we can do to stop these. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4138.0s)]
*  No, I think I think not. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4142.0s)]
*  I mean, I think the answer is going to do be exactly what we're doing here today. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4144.88s)]
*  And that is rally thousands of people all over this country will be our next trip. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4149.48s)]
*  We expect we'll probably be heading west, maybe to Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, whatever. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4153.48s)]
*  And just put pressure on these members of Congress now in fairness to them [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4159.24s)]
*  because of the corrupt campaign finance system. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4165.08s)]
*  If some Republican today stands up and says, you know what? [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4168.0s)]
*  I am not going to cut Medicaid in my district to get tax breaks to billionaires. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4171.96s)]
*  You know what happens the next day? [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4175.92s)]
*  Musk says, guess what? [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4177.28s)]
*  We're going to primary you. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4179.68s)]
*  I got endless amounts of money. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4180.76s)]
*  You're in trouble. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4181.96s)]
*  These guys are scared to death. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4182.6s)]
*  They're scared to death of Musk. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4184.16s)]
*  But we're going to have to force them to make a choice. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4185.88s)]
*  They could be scared to death of Musk or they could be scared to death [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4188.5599999999995s)]
*  of their own constituents. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4191.2s)]
*  That's the choice we're going to give them. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4193.44s)]
*  So look, I don't know if you have any interest in talking about [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4195.0s)]
*  what Democrats are doing wrong, if you cared about their outfits at the State [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4199.28s)]
*  of the Union, but we can we can skip it if you want. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4202.16s)]
*  Yeah, look, Democrats will do. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4203.88s)]
*  You want to talk about Democrats? [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4205.5599999999995s)]
*  I'll give you Chuck Schumer's number. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4206.76s)]
*  I came, Jeffy's talk to them. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4208.76s)]
*  I'm here doing, you know, as you know, I'm an independent, the longest [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4210.84s)]
*  I'm proudly longer standing independent in American congressional history. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4214.0s)]
*  I'm doing what I do. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4218.16s)]
*  Democrats will do what they do. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4219.16s)]
*  And that's that. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4221.68s)]
*  So we talked to a bunch of people on the line that were excited to be here. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4222.599999999999s)]
*  And one thing we heard was just people saying how much they believe in you. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4226.08s)]
*  They're here because they want to do what you think is best. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4230.5199999999995s)]
*  And they they view you as like a moral leader of the movement. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4232.72s)]
*  But they also are feeling [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4237.04s)]
*  worried and nervous that you're a little bit out here alone. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4240.16s)]
*  And, you know, you said that you may not seek reelection. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4243.68s)]
*  Well, you make that definitive. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4249.12s)]
*  I am. I said I didn't make it. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4250.84s)]
*  I am 38 years of age now. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4252.16s)]
*  I am getting old. You know, I'm not. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4254.0s)]
*  I'm not. Listen, I think there's 40, man. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4255.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't know. There's a lot of ways to be 89. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4257.72s)]
*  There's a lot of different versions of 89. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4259.44s)]
*  You're spry. You're spry. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4261.16s)]
*  We're rolling stones. They're still touring. But. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4262.24s)]
*  But do you think about do you think about a successor? [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4265.64s)]
*  No, I don't want to. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4269.0s)]
*  Look, all I will tell you is that one of the untold stories [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4269.76s)]
*  is that when I was in the house, [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4274.44s)]
*  I helped form the Progressive Caucus, you may know that. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4277.28s)]
*  And we had about five people at the time, grew a little bit. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4280.0s)]
*  Today, they're somewhere around 100. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4283.32s)]
*  And there are fantastic people, many of dozens of them, young people. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4285.28s)]
*  Many of them are women, people of color, great people. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4290.48s)]
*  So, you know, that is one of the success stories [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4294.08s)]
*  that the progressive movement has had. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4296.48s)]
*  We've elected people the likes of which when I was in the house, [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4297.92s)]
*  you know, 18 years ago, they didn't exist. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4302.0s)]
*  So we're making some real progress. We've got to do a lot more. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4304.32s)]
*  Here's my last question for you. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4306.88s)]
*  You want to talk about the future. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4309.12s)]
*  Would you ever take an edible with me and sit down [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4310.28s)]
*  and just have a conversation about the future? [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4312.08s)]
*  Just get really stoned on marijuana, really brainstorm? No. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4313.8s)]
*  But I'm happy to talk to you. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4317.88s)]
*  I don't need to do marijuana to talk. OK. What happened? [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4319.64s)]
*  What happened? What? [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4322.88s)]
*  What happened to the radical? [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4324.84s)]
*  What happened to the Bernie of the 60s? Let's get stoned. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4326.24s)]
*  Are you serious? Yeah. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4330.28s)]
*  No, that's not who I am. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4331.64s)]
*  As a matter of fact, I've done marijuana twice in my life. Twice. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4332.84s)]
*  Yeah, didn't quite agree with me. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4335.72s)]
*  Do you want to end daylight saving time? [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4337.16s)]
*  Doesn't matter. OK, thank you very much. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4339.92s)]
*  That's our show for today. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4342.08s)]
*  Dan and I will be back with a new show on Friday. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4343.0s)]
*  Talk to everybody then. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEd-8wFk36E&t=4344.92s)]
