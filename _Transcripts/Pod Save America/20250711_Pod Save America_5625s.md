Video Description: After promising 90 trade deals in 90 days and delivering only two, President Trump delays his arbitrary tariff deadline yet again. A former Trump Justice Department lawyer files a whistleblower complaint detailing the administration's efforts to defy court orders. MAGA's rift over Jeffrey Epstein deepens as Tucker Carlson, Andrew Schulz, and Candace Owens join the revolt. Jon and MSNBC's Alex Wagner break down all the latest, including the administration's absurd new investigation into former FBI Director James Comey, Kristi Noem's struggle to balance her job with posting on Instagram, and Twitter's self-proclaimed "MechaHitler" AI—and the prompt resignation of its CEO. Then Ana Ramon, Executive Director of the Texas Leadership Pipeline, joins to share her hopes for the future of the Lone Star State and why running for office—even in deep-red communities—isn't as scary as it seems.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

*  And then I talked to Anna Ramon an outstanding organizer whose group is working with vote save America [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=52.36s)]
*  To help recruit candidates to run for office in Texas. So stick around for that interview later [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=57.760000000000005s)]
*  But Alex, let's start with Donald Trump's global trade war. It's back and it's dumber than ever [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=63.2s)]
*  You might remember this line from Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro who White House colleagues have called dumber than a sack of bricks [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=69.72s)]
*  We're gonna run 90 deals in 90 days [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=77.12s)]
*  Alex we are recording this on day 90 and I regret to inform you that the number of trade deals stands at two [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=80.84s)]
*  That's not 90 the UK and Vietnam. That's not [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=87.88000000000001s)]
*  Trump has of course decided to buy himself more time by pushing back the deadline yet again to August 1st a [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  Date that everyone believes he'll stick to in the meantime Trump spent the week threatening at least 22 countries with higher tariffs [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=100.12s)]
*  Via letters that read like the president's truth social posts complete with an abundance of capitalizations and exclamations [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=107.76s)]
*  Except they were on [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=116.72s)]
*  White House letterhead [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=119.16s)]
*  The tariff threats went to countries. We already have trade deals with like South Korea. There's a free trade deal with South Korea [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=120.88s)]
*  So there's already zero tariffs between both countries [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=127.52s)]
*  And countries we have a trade surplus with like Brazil [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=130.6s)]
*  Which Trump threatened with 50% tariffs in part because he says he's upset [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=133.72s)]
*  That former president Bolsonaro is facing a trial for attempting a coup [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=139.12s)]
*  But obviously the Trump Trump's not big on people getting charged with trying to incite a coup [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  If you're wondering whether there's a method to all this madness [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=150.24s)]
*  This clip of Trump speaking about tariffs at a meeting with African leaders this week should clear things up [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=153.68s)]
*  Sir, can you explain how you calculated your latest round of tariffs? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=159.6s)]
*  Was there a formula that was used and do you expect any of these countries to face tariffs as well? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=163.6s)]
*  the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=169.8s)]
*  Formula was a formula based on common sense based on deficits [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=171.4s)]
*  based on [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=176.08s)]
*  How we've been treated over the years and based on raw numbers [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=177.60000000000002s)]
*  Here to face tariffs as well. I [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=184.08s)]
*  Haven't thought of it, but I maybe I don't know. Let's see. I like him him him him and him [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=187.08s)]
*  No, I don't think so. Not too much. Very good. These are friends of mine now. It's a rigorous process Alex [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=192.08s)]
*  The highest standards so the markets have recovered since Trump retreated from his Liberation Day tariffs [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=199.68s)]
*  Prices on some imports have risen but nothing drastic [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=207.48000000000002s)]
*  Although we've actually lost manufacturing jobs [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=211.16s)]
*  So that part of the promise of tariffs has not come true [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=213.6s)]
*  Trump's approval on the economy and especially trade has taken a hit but his overall ratings aren't too much lower [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=216.76s)]
*  What do you make of the White House decision or Trump's decision to restart this trade war right now? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=222.88s)]
*  well, I think you know numerically they can still get the just [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=229.56s)]
*  The basic count counting correct like 89 comes before 90 so there's that [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=234.76s)]
*  Right, they'd set this arbitrary deadline of 90 deals in 90 days. It was day 89. They had to do something [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=240.56s)]
*  But like John [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=247.2s)]
*  It's the most foolish clownish [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=249.23999999999998s)]
*  Endeavor ever I mean I you focus on you know [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=253.28s)]
*  Some of these countries that we are have trade surpluses with I mean [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=256.76s)]
*  I know that Burma Myanmar my where my mom is from is on the list with maybe a 40% tariff [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=259.92s)]
*  For anybody that's been following even the scantest of news about Burma. There's a civil war going on [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=266.12s)]
*  There's you know millions of displaced people there tens of thousands dead [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=272.8s)]
*  the annual per capita income is [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=278.32s)]
*  $1,200 a year like the idea that we're gonna launch a trade war with Burma is like I mean not only [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=280.88s)]
*  Stupid but craven in the same way that Trump's talking about needing Vietnam to buy more American SUVs in a country that has insanely [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=288.59999999999997s)]
*  Narrow roads and where the average per capita income is like four thousand dollars a year like there is no there is no [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=295.96s)]
*  Sense there is no actual economic strategy that undergirds this it's like literally. I don't know [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=304.2s)]
*  There's the human facts person that he employs at the White House like there's someone standing at the copy machine [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=310.38s)]
*  Just like firing off the tariff letters with arbitrary numbers plugged in and the worst part about it [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=316.02000000000004s)]
*  I mean, I honestly think the thing that [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=321.82s)]
*  Most hurts Trump is that everybody's on to him, you know, like the taco thing Trump always chickens out [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=324.78000000000003s)]
*  I think is for Trump the most humiliating piece of all of this [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=331.38s)]
*  Which is the market saying like screw you dude, like this is why we didn't see market panic this time is because they're they get it [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=335.22s)]
*  This is his game. This is his shtick. It's August 1 [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=341.48s)]
*  Then it'll be September 15th, then it'll be November 9th or whatever the fuck [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=344.74s)]
*  It's gonna be but all of this is so arbitrary and ill-conceived. It makes herbal life look like some brilliant marketing scheme [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=348.18s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? Like there's just [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=354.62s)]
*  there is [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=356.38s)]
*  There there I don't even know how it ends [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=357.82s)]
*  Like maybe someone gets it with a tariff at some point [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=359.90000000000003s)]
*  But the idea that we're restructuring a trade imbalance in the course of you know [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=362.46000000000004s)]
*  Even a couple months is a laughable concept all this stuff takes years to hammer out and if he had just stuck with oh [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=367.02s)]
*  I don't know the TPP which was not hammered out by his administration, but he unwound we would be in a much better place [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=373.06s)]
*  But I mean what is what is actual you know economic policy really matter when you could just you know [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=379.18s)]
*  Have fun at the Xerox machine like I don't know Xerox in your butt and [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=384.6s)]
*  Make it a bunch of letters, which is just freelancing [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=388.34000000000003s)]
*  Apparently the the new numbers [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=392.06s)]
*  That they sent to all these countries the terror threat. They are sort of like the Liberation Day numbers [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=394.7s)]
*  But they're like off by one or two percent for no apparent reason and in different countries like they just sort of like rounded [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=400.86s)]
*  Up or down just based on whatever [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=407.7s)]
*  and then of course there's you know the idea that he's [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=409.58s)]
*  Doing 50% tariffs on Brazil because he's just pissed that they're holding a former leader accountable [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=412.34s)]
*  So this there's just no rhyme or reason to it. I mean as it is now [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=417.98s)]
*  We're already at like I think we have like an average tariff rate of like 17 and a half percent [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=421.98s)]
*  In the United States with with other with all of our trading partners with the rest of the world if you average all the [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=428.14s)]
*  countries together and [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=432.62s)]
*  That's higher than it's been at any time since the 30s [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=433.86s)]
*  I think and I think people like you know certainly the markets calm down because he walked a lot of this back [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=438.26s)]
*  But some of the price increases like you're not gonna take effect [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=446.22s)]
*  Until like a bunch of importers rushed to import a bunch of goods before [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=450.78000000000003s)]
*  Some of these tariffs went into effect [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=455.5s)]
*  So we're still gonna like it's not showing up in the economic data yet [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=457.66s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that we're out of the woods even if he doesn't impose any new tariffs and keeps kicking the can down the road [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=460.86s)]
*  But I don't know I mean you're right about the taco thing like I think it's [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=467.42s)]
*  Humiliating enough to him that I also wonder if he's not gonna be like fuck it [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=471.1s)]
*  I don't want to be called that again. I'm just gonna write them all the tariffs the taco thing on so many levels [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=474.76s)]
*  Is is like his kryptonite right because it goes right to his ego and the idea that Wall Street which he is, you know [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=480.54s)]
*  Is obsessed with would think he's a clown is enough to motivate someone like Trump to do something totally reckless [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=488.21999999999997s)]
*  And that's I think that it's both, you know sort of delicious to see some, you know a group of you know [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=495.21999999999997s)]
*  Wall Street minus just [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=502.62s)]
*  embarrass him, but it's also a little terrifying because [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=505.06s)]
*  When he is in that position he tends to do even more unusually [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=508.86s)]
*  Foolish and foolhardy and reckless things. So I don't know how I don't know by the way also is why I don't love Democrats [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=513.9s)]
*  Like doing the taco thing as a joke and like continuing to push it like watch out guys. Watch out watch out [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=520.74s)]
*  Yeah, like I don't I mean, I guess politically right if he goes and crashes the economy. That's [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=527.1s)]
*  That's really politically bad for him [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=533.8199999999999s)]
*  But do we really want to do we really want to live through a global trade war that sends prices skyrocketing? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=535.86s)]
*  You know, I don't think most people do in this country [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=542.02s)]
*  On the around thing. I think Chuck Schumer was like a taco on Iran. It's like well any bombed Iran [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=545.3s)]
*  So I mean, are we happy now? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=550.22s)]
*  Yeah, be careful with the taco. It may come for you next. Yeah, so we'll see though. I mean I [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=553.46s)]
*  You know, we can't predict these things because who the fuck knows and he has he keeps kicking the deadlines back [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=559.0600000000001s)]
*  But I do think that one of these days soon. He's gonna he's gonna snap and say no, we're going with terrorists [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=564.5400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it'll be interesting to see which country it is, right? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=570.34s)]
*  I mean or all of them there are people that are negotiating in earnest, right? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=572.6600000000001s)]
*  The EU is with ignosciate there. There's there is movement happening behind the scenes [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=576.6800000000001s)]
*  And if we're lucky the sort of net net of all of this is that one of those real actual substantive negotiations [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=581.26s)]
*  Comes through he can point to it as an example of his reset and then move on and say I'm not a top [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=587.82s)]
*  I'm not taco like look what I did with the EU. You're welcome by and that is where it ends [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=592.38s)]
*  But who knows with him? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=597.98s)]
*  I mean look out Myanmar like like you may get a 40% tariff in the middle of your civil war [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=599.1800000000001s)]
*  That's I just obviously find that particularly galling but so many things are it's hard to pick one more drawback to to taco [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=603.38s)]
*  I hate that I fucking keep saying this but is that these countries [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=610.5200000000001s)]
*  They don't really have an instance like some of them haven't reached out to negotiate because they don't have an incentive to do that [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=615.2s)]
*  Because a lot of them don't believe him because he keeps backing up [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=619.9200000000001s)]
*  So even even from his perspective [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=623.0s)]
*  He's not gonna get the deals he wants to get or have the leverage that he wants to have [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=625.48s)]
*  Because a lot of these countries just aren't taking him or us seriously, which I completely understand [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=629.76s)]
*  I mean, I think and also the taco narrative. I'm sorry. We just kind of keep talking that I gotta keep saying it is is a [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=635.6s)]
*  I mean it is being used liberally in this moment, but it is [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=641.12s)]
*  Something to pay attention to because it is also a placeholder for so much of his attitude towards so many different things, right? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=647.8000000000001s)]
*  Like this idea that he'll say one thing whether it's prosecuting political enemies or whether it's you know, financial trade matter economic and trade matters [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=653.14s)]
*  There is so much bluster. There's so much threatening behavior at all times because that's effectively the only strategy. He knows how to run [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=660.32s)]
*  You know, I think this is an interesting development in that because if it's not as taken out of Trump's quiver if he is [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=666.8199999999999s)]
*  You know if that arrow is taken out of his quiver and and it's you know, he's widely seen as you know [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=674.18s)]
*  If it is an emperor has no clothes moment. It sort of does bag the question of like, okay [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=678.9s)]
*  Well, what what happens next on a host of other? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=684.14s)]
*  You know area in a host of other areas where Trump's threats are his only an essential negotiating tools [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=686.66s)]
*  But it is in that way [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=693.3s)]
*  I think it's more meaningful than just the sort of like tariff Xeroxes that are being circulated around the world for sure for sure [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=695.26s)]
*  Alright lots of news this week on Stephen Miller's quest to live out his teenage fantasy of deporting people who don't look like him [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=703.06s)]
*  He got some bad news from a federal judge in New Hampshire on Thursday who issued a nationwide injunction [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=709.5799999999999s)]
*  Blocking Trump's decree that being born in America no longer makes you a citizen [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=714.74s)]
*  You might remember the Supreme Court recently limited lower court judges ability to issue nationwide injunctions [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=718.6600000000001s)]
*  But they did carve out an exception for class-action lawsuits, which is exactly what the ACLU you did in this case and it worked [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=724.5s)]
*  now we wait to see what the Supreme Court says about the constitutionality of [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=731.38s)]
*  ending birthright citizenship and [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=736.14s)]
*  Whether the Trump administration will abide by their ruling since they don't seem to think [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=738.58s)]
*  They really have to with some of these rulings [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=743.84s)]
*  We got more evidence for that thanks to a new whistleblower report from a rez [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=746.4599999999999s)]
*  Rouvenny a 15 year veteran of the Department of Justice who defended some of the first Trump administration's most controversial [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=751.78s)]
*  immigration decisions in court [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=759.0999999999999s)]
*  Including the travel ban so not a lib not a rhino [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=761.14s)]
*  This was guy this guy was a DOJ career guy who defended the Trump administration in the first in the first administration a lot of their [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=764.78s)]
*  immigration stuff [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=772.0999999999999s)]
*  But he says that back in March top Trump personal lawyer turned deputy attorney general a meal bovey [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=773.5s)]
*  Who's waiting to be confirmed by the Senate for a lifetime appellate judgeship? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=780.94s)]
*  said in a meeting that the Department of Justice quote would need to consider telling the courts fuck you and [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=785.46s)]
*  Defy a court order blocking Trump from using the alien enemies act to send Venezuelans to the [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=791.78s)]
*  foreign gulag and El Salvador CICOT [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=798.14s)]
*  Rouvenny also claims that another Trump DOJ lawyer drew ensign lied to a federal judge when asked whether he knew if planes of [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=801.46s)]
*  Migrants were about to take off for El Salvador [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=808.78s)]
*  Rouvenny has texts emails and other documents to back up his claims [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=811.98s)]
*  So Trump administration's obviously trying to discredit this guy. How well do you think that's gonna go and could? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=817.14s)]
*  Rez Rouvenny be a [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=824.22s)]
*  Problem for the White House first of all this whistleblower report is just like confirms everything you imagine is happening in the DOJ, right? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=826.46s)]
*  Like yeah, why don't we just submit an O an emoji of the middle finger is our response to this filing? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=834.14s)]
*  That's like literally from the documents. It's what you it's like it's like a bunch of guys sitting around [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=839.46s)]
*  I mean these guys are saying it I think as they as it has been characterized as gallows humor, right? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=845.78s)]
*  Like this is so fucking depressing that we're saying fuck you to the courts [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=851.38s)]
*  But the general gist of the sort of climate the the general climate inside of the DOJ [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=855.02s)]
*  appears to be one of complete impunity like and and and sort of like [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=861.7s)]
*  Joking about the rule of law at the Department of Justice [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=866.7800000000001s)]
*  We should just never get past the sort of the fundamental allegations and this was a whistleblowing report [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=869.94s)]
*  But I mean, I think it's a problem for me [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=875.26s)]
*  And his confirmation to be at the second, you know the feeder to the Supreme Court like as [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=877.6s)]
*  Absurd as it would be I think Trump is genuinely thinking about a meal bovey becoming a Supreme Court justice [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=883.88s)]
*  If he's trying to put him on a appeals appeals court seat [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=889.68s)]
*  and I think [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=893.64s)]
*  you know look I [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=896.24s)]
*  It's hard to say whether or not it's gonna be a problem for the White House. I mean I do think [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=899.3199999999999s)]
*  There is a sense that in Maggaland [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=905.48s)]
*  You do whatever the president asks you of you no matter what and there as as I'm sure we'll talk about there's a real lust for [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=909.8s)]
*  Deportations in any form or fashion extra judicial or not like and if you're not following the line with those deportations [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=916.16s)]
*  No matter what the circumstances then you got to get tossed out on your ass and like whether this costs Trump anything with his base [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=922.0s)]
*  I think is I mean, I think it probably doesn't right? It should cost him with the broader American public, but I don't know [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=927.04s)]
*  Like there's so many things that we deal with on a daily basis does one whistleblower do it? I [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=933.0s)]
*  I think legally though. It could be a problem for him, right? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=939.1999999999999s)]
*  I think that there's there is the the the court of law that law that will not look kindly into these allegations [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=942.28s)]
*  Especially given the reality of these deportations and how Trump is trying to break the law there [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=947.88s)]
*  So this is further fuel for that fire and I will say John, you know, there's it's an interesting thing, right? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=952.04s)]
*  During Trump won there was a feeling that like Trump [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=959.24s)]
*  mistakenly hired these semi principled people who acted as guardrails and like oh [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=963.36s)]
*  In Trump to it's like the worst of the worst and the entire system is populated by Neanderthals [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=969.2s)]
*  Who will just do whatever he says and moments like this [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=975.2s)]
*  Just offer a little bit of hope that you know [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=978.8000000000001s)]
*  There are still people who don't think of themselves as partisans don't think of themselves as gay [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=981.84s)]
*  Keepers for democracy or institutional atlases holding up the entire firmament, but that's still absolutely recognized even [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=987.2s)]
*  Though they may be die-hard kind of conservatives that you can't do certain things [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=995.72s)]
*  And I don't I think we should hold on to that that there are still people inside the the system [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1000.5200000000001s)]
*  Who can understand right from wrong? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1006.6800000000001s)]
*  And if they are if if I think people who care about that can help protect this person's integrity [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1008.6400000000001s)]
*  Assuming he deserves it and this is all true then that hopefully will encourage more people to do the right thing even though they may be subsumed in the you know the Trump swamp [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1015.52s)]
*  I mean I found it really heartening that there's a whistleblower right now who's saying like this is fucking unacceptable and [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1022.52s)]
*  Here are all the text messages that prove the way in which these guys knew that they were breaking the law and flaunting it and [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1027.84s)]
*  Flouting it and doing whatever they needed to do to just get people that they don't like out of the country [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1033.68s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's there's two ways to do it [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1038.48s)]

*  He gives this interview to the New York Times [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1124.48s)]
*  He's like, look, the reason this is important [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1126.48s)]
*  is they sent 248 people to CICOT [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1128.48s)]
*  And we have no idea [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1132.48s)]
*  why, where these people are right now [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1134.48s)]
*  whether they're alive [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1138.48s)]
*  whether they've been tortured like [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1140.48s)]
*  Abrego Garcia claims he was when he was there [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1142.48s)]
*  there was no due process [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1144.48s)]
*  and we now know from this whistleblower [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1146.48s)]
*  and from a bunch of other evidence [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1150.48s)]
*  A, they knew that the judge and the courts [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1152.48s)]
*  didn't want them to send these plans [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1156.48s)]
*  they sent them anyway [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1158.48s)]
*  so they sent a bunch of people to a foreign gulag [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1160.48s)]
*  in defiance of court orders [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1163.48s)]
*  knowing that the court didn't want it [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1165.48s)]
*  and saying, yeah, maybe we're just going to say fuck you anyway [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1168.48s)]
*  and then when they found out that they mistakenly sent someone [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1170.48s)]
*  they've just fired the guy who just told the truth about that [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1174.48s)]
*  I mean, when you think about like [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1178.48s)]
*  being that person, right? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1181.48s)]
*  or being Andres Ramirez, right? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1183.48s)]
*  or being any of the people whose names we don't know [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1185.48s)]
*  who are in CICOT [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1187.48s)]
*  could they be Tren de Aragua? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1189.48s)]
*  Yeah, some of them [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1191.48s)]
*  could they be really bad people? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1192.48s)]
*  Yeah, some of them [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1193.48s)]
*  but some of them seem like they're completely fucking innocent [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1194.48s)]
*  Well, and you put that [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1196.48s)]
*  you put the whistleblower's account [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1198.48s)]
*  and his sense of alarm about what's happening to people in this country [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1200.48s)]
*  together with the viral videos that now exist [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1203.48s)]
*  of people just being snatched at court [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1206.48s)]
*  or snatched in parking lots [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1208.48s)]
*  and like in the most sort of violent [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1210.48s)]
*  terrifying fashion by masked ICE agents [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1214.48s)]
*  in unmarked cars [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1217.48s)]
*  and you think, I mean, that does not look like a study in [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1219.48s)]
*  a well-oiled deportation machine [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1223.48s)]
*  it looks like vigilante justice [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1226.48s)]
*  it looks like dragnets [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1228.48s)]
*  it looks insanely haphazard and maybe illegal [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1230.48s)]
*  and then you couple that with the alarm that's happening [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1233.48s)]
*  inside the Department of Justice [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1235.48s)]
*  where they're processing these deportations [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1236.48s)]
*  and dealing with the courts [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1238.48s)]
*  and actually getting people out of the country [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1239.48s)]
*  and you have someone saying, this is really wrong [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1241.48s)]
*  and we don't know what we're doing [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1243.48s)]
*  and we shouldn't be doing that [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1244.48s)]
*  I mean, I think those two things collectively [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1245.48s)]
*  could create a problem for the Trump administration [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1248.48s)]
*  because you have the combination of the American public [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1250.48s)]
*  bearing witness to what's happening in their cities and towns [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1253.48s)]
*  across the country [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1255.48s)]
*  and then this coming from inside Washington [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1257.48s)]
*  and it's not just a local story [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1259.48s)]
*  it's not just a DC story [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1261.48s)]
*  it's the two things together [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1262.48s)]
*  and I think that makes it more resonant [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1263.48s)]
*  And by the way, even if the Department of Justice [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1266.48s)]
*  still has hundreds of Erez Rubinis there [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1268.48s)]
*  who are willing to speak up [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1272.48s)]
*  the challenge now is ICE is going to have a bigger budget [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1274.48s)]
*  than the FBI [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1277.48s)]
*  and it's going to be the biggest law enforcement agency [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1279.48s)]
*  in the country [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1283.48s)]
*  and the standards for training and recruiting for ICE [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1284.48s)]
*  are much, much lower than the FBI agents [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1288.48s)]
*  who spend weeks and weeks in Quantico [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1291.48s)]
*  and have graduate degrees and go through all these [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1293.48s)]
*  like it is, we're headed for a really dark place now [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1295.48s)]
*  Yeah, I will just say [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1299.48s)]
*  even with a bigger budget [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1301.48s)]
*  and less talented, less trained people [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1303.48s)]
*  I guess these two things [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1308.48s)]
*  even with a bigger budget [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1309.48s)]
*  I'll say nothing of the actual employees [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1310.48s)]
*  but even with a bigger budget [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1312.48s)]
*  the fact of the matter is [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1313.48s)]
*  you're not going to get 3,000 Trenda Agua gang members every day [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1314.48s)]
*  you're going to always have to grab people at Home Depot [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1318.48s)]
*  you're going to always have to find hotel workers and farm workers [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1321.48s)]
*  I mean, you cannot get the numbers that they have set out [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1324.48s)]
*  Stephen Miller has set out [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1327.48s)]
*  without going after those people [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1328.48s)]
*  and legal residents [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1330.48s)]
*  Exactly, and you're just going to [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1332.48s)]
*  honestly, with more budget and less trained people [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1334.48s)]
*  you're probably going to have more of these videos [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1337.48s)]
*  and more of these things happening [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1339.48s)]
*  and more coverage of these violent sort of raids and seizures [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1341.48s)]
*  of people who may be here with the right papers [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1345.48s)]
*  It's not good news for people who are getting deported [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1348.48s)]
*  but in terms of the story really having legs [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1351.48s)]
*  and the situation becoming measurably, palpably worse [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1354.48s)]
*  and therefore resonant and affecting to the American public [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1358.48s)]
*  I think it will be [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1361.48s)]
*  Yeah, there's a DACA recipient in Alligator Alcatraz right now [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1362.48s)]
*  Miami Herald just reported today [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1367.48s)]
*  So, worst of the worst [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1369.48s)]
*  but it's a DACA recipient who absolutely has a right to be here [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1370.48s)]
*  and has a lot of experience [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1373.48s)]
*  I mean, that's why Democrats need to champion the stories of the people [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1374.48s)]
*  that are getting snapped up in this stuff [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1378.48s)]
*  I mean, that's where the storytelling really matters [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1381.48s)]
*  because Trump has painted everyone with a very broad brush [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1384.48s)]
*  and until you can say that person's name [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1387.48s)]
*  and where they went to school [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1390.48s)]
*  or what their story is [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1391.48s)]
*  I don't, I mean, I think the sense of tragedy needs to be piercing [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1392.48s)]
*  because right now I'm not going to be able to [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1399.48s)]
*  needs to be piercing because right now I think it's just kind of [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1401.48s)]
*  a more abstract horror at what's unfolding [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1406.48s)]
*  but I think there needs to be a little bit more personal investment [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1409.48s)]
*  in the trials of these people who are, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1412.48s)]
*  whose lives are being upended by all of us [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1415.48s)]
*  Yeah, no, I totally agree [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1417.48s)]
*  Miller's immigration purge is running into other problems [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1419.48s)]
*  thanks to Trump's Agriculture Secretary, Brooke Rollins [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1423.48s)]
*  and prominent Trump supporters like Joe Rogan [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1426.48s)]
*  who apparently had dinner with the President last week [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1428.48s)]
*  on last episode we played a clip of Rogan talking about how [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1431.48s)]
*  I thought it was supposed to be criminals [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1436.48s)]
*  and now they're deporting all these farm workers [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1437.48s)]
*  and the Home Depot raids and all that [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1439.48s)]
*  and apparently he had dinner with Trump [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1440.48s)]
*  and basically what's happening is Rollins, the Agriculture Secretary, and Rogan types [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1442.48s)]
*  keep getting Trump to promise that he'll exempt [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1447.48s)]
*  undocumented farm workers and perhaps hospitality workers from deportation [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1451.48s)]
*  and then after he makes that promise on Truth Social [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1456.48s)]
*  or says he's going to do work permits or whatever else [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1459.48s)]
*  people like Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon get really pissed [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1461.48s)]
*  and Trump changes his mind again [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1464.48s)]
*  So do you think this immigration split in Trump's coalition is meaningful at all? [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1466.48s)]
*  or do you think it will keep getting this back and forth? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1473.48s)]
*  or do the Millers and Bannons just went out? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1476.48s)]
*  I'm interested in this [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1479.48s)]
*  I think, I mean look, I'm very interested in the fracture that's forming within Trump's base [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1480.48s)]
*  the center can't really hold between the big beautiful bill [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1485.48s)]
*  that is the largest, most significant redistribution of wealth in a generation [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1491.48s)]
*  and pushes it upwards at the expense of the poor and the working class [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1496.48s)]
*  many of whom are in Trump's base [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1500.48s)]
*  to the immigration stuff which pits wealthy business owners against [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1503.48s)]
*  against MAGA nativists who want to see, who probably believe in many ways [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1509.48s)]
*  or in many corners in Great Replacement Theory [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1514.48s)]
*  ideas about white supremacy being encroached upon by brown people [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1517.48s)]
*  I mean these are deeply held ideals and beliefs on either side of the Trump coalition [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1521.48s)]
*  and I think it's a real stress test [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1528.48s)]
*  and on the immigration stuff, like the tax stuff he can just hope that [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1533.48s)]
*  because the worst cuts don't happen until after the midterms [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1537.48s)]
*  he can sort of like blame the Democrats [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1540.48s)]
*  so maybe there's a reprieve there in terms of like being able to stitch the coalition together on it [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1543.48s)]
*  for a little bit longer than might otherwise be the case [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1548.48s)]
*  but on the immigration stuff like we were just talking about [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1550.48s)]
*  you cannot do what MAGA base wants [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1553.48s)]
*  which is the excision of millions of the [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1557.48s)]
*  you know, excising some significant part of this country [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1561.48s)]
*  from the economy and from the fabric of our democracy [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1566.48s)]
*  without going after the gardeners and the Home Depot people and the hotel workers [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1570.48s)]
*  like you just, the math does not work [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1574.48s)]
*  and I know math is not Donald Trump's strong suit, John [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1576.48s)]
*  as we discussed at the top of the show [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1579.48s)]
*  but I mean they seem, the 3,000 deportations a day figure is like [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1581.48s)]
*  is popular knowledge at this point and they seem very intent on managing it [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1586.48s)]
*  I don't, one thing I don't think you can do is keep teasing reprieves [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1590.48s)]
*  and then not delivering, I mean people are gonna [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1595.48s)]
*  they're gonna go, they're gonna, you know, that debt is gonna get called in at some point [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1598.48s)]
*  and it's gonna start to affect actual industry [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1602.48s)]
*  so I do think that this is a real problem for him [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1604.48s)]
*  and I have no idea how he navigates it because he constantly talks out of both sides of his mouth [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1608.48s)]
*  and this is one of those things where it's like the rubber is literally meeting the road [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1613.48s)]
*  I mean every passing day exacerbates the tension between, you know, business and MAGA [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1616.48s)]
*  and there's no, there's literally, they are diametrically opposed [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1623.48s)]
*  and therefore I don't know how you square that circle [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1627.48s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1629.48s)]
*  I know, I was gonna say to your point about [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1630.48s)]
*  it's why, when we were just talking about the deportations to, you know, Seacot and everything [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1632.48s)]
*  making sure that we're telling these stories is gonna be important [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1640.48s)]
*  because of the debt coming due, as you mentioned, right? [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1643.48s)]
*  Like Joe Rogan has dinner with Donald Trump, Donald Trump says [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1647.48s)]
*  oh yeah, we're gonna protect the farm workers, no problem [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1650.48s)]
*  and then Joe Rogan sees a video of a bunch of farm workers getting rounded up and deported [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1652.48s)]
*  or hotel workers or whoever [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1657.48s)]
*  and what does he think he's gonna do then? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1659.48s)]
*  You think Joe Rogan's just gonna be like, oh well I must have been mistaken [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1661.48s)]
*  I'm sure he was gonna, like, he's gonna get criticism from a lot of people who supported him [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1664.48s)]
*  and you know, you're starting to see these cases we've already seen over the last several months [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1670.48s)]
*  where there'll be deportations and people getting rounded up, people with legal status [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1674.48s)]
*  in like deep red areas, right? [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1679.48s)]
*  And in these, like that woman who was in that rural Missouri county [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1681.48s)]
*  who everyone, like oh she's been a part of our community for decades [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1685.48s)]
*  and you know, they finally released her [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1689.48s)]
*  but I think it's starting to make even hardcore Trump supporters [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1691.48s)]
*  or at least people who voted for him, you know, a couple times [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1696.48s)]
*  think like, hmm, I thought only the bad ones were getting deported [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1699.48s)]
*  Right, exactly. I mean this is, yeah, that's the thing is people know these people [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1702.48s)]
*  and I think with so much in Trump land he can get away with these generalities about the libs or whatever [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1707.48s)]
*  but these touch people in their backyards and at their diners and you know [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1713.48s)]
*  like in their ordinary everyday American lives and you can't escape that reality [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1717.48s)]
*  So the president has another problem with his MAGA base that's less consequential to the country [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1721.48s)]
*  but possibly more consequential to his political standing [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1726.48s)]
*  and certainly way more fun to talk about the case of the missing Epstein files [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1729.48s)]
*  So Tommy and I have been talking about this all week [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1734.48s)]
*  I don't know how many... [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1738.48s)]
*  I'm sure you have, yeah, uh-huh. I'm not surprised [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1739.48s)]
*  But the fire just keeps burning with the White House now taking criticism from all corners of the MAGA coalition [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1742.48s)]
*  Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones, Candace Owens, Laura Loomer, Tom Fitton, Megan Kelly, Andrew Schultz [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1748.48s)]
*  They're all pissed. Many of them have called on Pam Bondi to resign [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1754.48s)]
*  And then here's Tucker [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1758.48s)]
*  And I do think as someone who voted for the president campaign for the president a lot [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1760.48s)]
*  I'm not attacking the president [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1765.48s)]
*  But I think even people who are fully on board with the bulk of the MAGA agenda are like [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1768.48s)]
*  this is too much actually [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1774.48s)]
*  I'm saying that with love and I hope that they're listening [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1776.48s)]
*  because I think this threatens to blow up the whole thing [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1780.48s)]
*  But let's just... [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1782.48s)]
*  What do you think? Do you agree with Tucker? Does this threaten to blow up the whole thing? [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1783.48s)]
*  Is that what it sounds like when Tucker says things with love? [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1786.48s)]
*  Like I haven't... [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1789.48s)]
*  Yeah, right [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1790.48s)]
*  I didn't know what that intonation sounded like [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1791.48s)]
*  That was lust [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1794.48s)]
*  First of all, this is not the first time Tucker has said I think this threatens to blow up his entire presidency [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1799.48s)]
*  or the whole coalition [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1804.48s)]
*  So let's just like, let's just acknowledge that [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1805.48s)]
*  Prone to exaggeration, that one [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1808.48s)]
*  As someone on the sidelines in all of this [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1810.48s)]
*  I will say I'm torn between thinking like Democrats should absolutely... [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1813.48s)]
*  Chris Van Hollen I think today is like calling for an amendment to an appropriations bill [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1818.48s)]
*  that asks for further investigation and a report about Jeffrey Epstein [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1823.48s)]
*  Nice [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1827.48s)]
*  Part of me is like, ride that pony all the way to the bank, Chris Van Hollen [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1828.48s)]
*  Keep those home fires burning [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1833.48s)]
*  Maybe Pam Bondi needs to be ousted [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1835.48s)]
*  Maybe, maybe, maybe [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1837.48s)]
*  The very, very capable Ms. Bondi needs to actually feel some consequences [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1839.48s)]
*  because it's such just desserts, right? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1843.48s)]
*  Like ye who have spent, you know, a significant portion of the last several years spinning conspiracy theories [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1845.48s)]
*  diluting the American public, poisoning our democracy [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1854.48s)]
*  Now you, Cash Patel, and you, Pam Bondi, and you, Dan Bongino are in the hot seat [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1857.48s)]
*  How does it feel? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1864.48s)]
*  What does it feel like to be actually doing a thing [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1865.48s)]
*  and have everybody telling you you're like doing the devil's work? [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1867.48s)]
*  Why don't you go visit Comet Pizza and have a fucking slice? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1870.48s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1873.48s)]
*  Yes [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1874.48s)]
*  So, that's a Pizza Gate reference to anybody who's not from Washington, D.C. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1875.48s)]
*  Why don't you give John Podesta a call and ask him some advice? [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1880.48s)]
*  Yeah [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1885.48s)]
*  So right, so there's that piece of it [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1886.48s)]
*  However, like this is the trial, this is the Sophie's Choice for all Democrats and liberals and people who give a shit about democracy [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1888.48s)]
*  So there's that Schadenfreude piece of this which is like, yes, okay, keep, keep, like, keep digging [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1896.48s)]
*  And then there's the reality that like so many DOJ employees who were actually working on real criminal concerns [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1902.48s)]
*  were taken off that work to work on the Epstein stuff [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1908.48s)]
*  which was a complete waste of resources and time [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1912.48s)]
*  when in a moment they're like real, you know, the DOJ has legitimate work to do [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1914.48s)]
*  setting aside whatever Trump wants them to do [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1918.48s)]
*  There's work that needs to be done in those halls [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1920.48s)]
*  And like maybe now we can just shut the door on the Jeffrey Epstein conspiracy theory [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1922.48s)]
*  and we can please all move along [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1926.48s)]
*  Like if you are offered the opportunity to lay to rest a nasty conspiracy that, you know, has just fueled speculation [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1928.48s)]
*  and like, you know, turned some people's lives upside down [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1938.48s)]
*  maybe we should take that opportunity [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1942.48s)]
*  It's a hard, it's tough math though, John, it's tough math [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1944.48s)]
*  Yeah, it is tough math, that's the theme of this episode [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1947.48s)]
*  Here, it's, the Charm Fright is great, right, like screw these people [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1951.48s)]
*  But I'm thinking about the base, right, like what led, what has led a lot of people to join the MAGA movement, right [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1957.48s)]
*  is not necessarily any one policy, though there's some of that for some people [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1966.48s)]
*  They like the deportation stuff, they want to build the wall, all that [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1970.48s)]
*  And obviously it's like a love for Trump [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1973.48s)]
*  But some of it is they, you know, it's, we've split into new coalitions [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1976.48s)]
*  We're the institutionalists and the Democratic Party and the Republicans got all the cranks, right [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1981.48s)]
*  This is like Matt Iglesias, I think, coined the term a couple months ago [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1985.48s)]
*  And so it's like, it's a crank coalition now, right [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1989.48s)]
*  And that's how they got RFK Jr. and they got Tulsi Gabbard and they got all these people [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1992.48s)]
*  and they believe in conspiracies and they don't believe in, you know, in any kind of authority or expertise or anything [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=1995.48s)]
*  And so for those people who put these people into office [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2002.48s)]
*  now to have these people who promised them that they would uncover the worst conspiracies [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2007.48s)]
*  and that they would go after the deep state and they would do all this stuff [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2012.48s)]
*  to have that promise broken by Donald Trump himself [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2015.48s)]
*  I don't know if this is the thing that cracks the coalition or hurts Trump [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2019.48s)]
*  but I think it opens the door [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2024.48s)]
*  I mean, I think this is a bigger wound [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2026.48s)]
*  or at least it could become a bigger wound than I thought at first [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2029.48s)]
*  just because this is the stuff that really drives his base, unfortunately, for all of us [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2034.48s)]
*  Right, it's like bombing Iran, maybe getting us onto another Middle East war [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2040.48s)]
*  That's bad, but like not finding out what, you know, Prince Andrew was really doing [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2044.48s)]
*  Like that is the thing, that's the straw that broke the camel's back [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2049.48s)]
*  But you may be right, and I think probably collectively [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2052.48s)]
*  The feeling that the Trump administration is betraying, you know, the promises made to the base [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2055.48s)]
*  whether it's, I mean, they may not register it, the shredding of the social safety net [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2060.48s)]
*  whether it is getting the US involved in foreign wars [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2066.48s)]
*  whether it is, you know, offering special dispensation to the hotel industry and the agricultural industry [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2069.48s)]
*  or whether it is non-delivering on one of the greatest conspiracies of the 21st century [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2077.48s)]
*  All of this can lead to a mounting sense of betrayal [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2083.48s)]
*  So maybe there is some word, wisdom in Tucker Carlson's words of love [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2087.48s)]
*  Also, this can go on forever because there's only two possibilities here [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2092.48s)]
*  The most likely one, which is the list doesn't exist [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2098.48s)]
*  They're telling the truth now, right? [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2101.48s)]
*  So the list doesn't exist, they're telling the truth [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2104.48s)]
*  In which case, no matter what they do, they can keep pushing [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2106.48s)]
*  They're never going to get a list, they can fire Pam Bondi [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2111.48s)]
*  But then the next Attorney General, the primary litmus test for the next Attorney General will be [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2114.48s)]
*  can you produce the Epstein list, which they won't be able to because there's no list [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2119.48s)]
*  Do you remember they had an influencer event at the White House [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2124.48s)]
*  where they gave out binders with already previously released Rolodex rules or whatever it was from Jeffrey Epstein's office [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2129.48s)]
*  They're so desperate to find anything, it shocks me [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2138.48s)]
*  They couldn't find a thing to try and spin up [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2142.48s)]
*  It must be such an open and shut case that they couldn't even find [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2145.48s)]
*  Well, we did find a packet of Splenda in a cell that may or may not have been Splenda [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2150.48s)]
*  Just like anything, there was literally nothing for them to hold on to in the report [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2156.48s)]
*  It tells you something about the state of affairs [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2161.48s)]
*  Or the less likely possibility that there was something and now they're just going to cover it up forever [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2163.48s)]
*  Then Tucker and all of them were right, so who knows [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2169.48s)]

*  Paz of America is brought to you by Zbiotics Pre-Alcohol [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2244.48s)]
*  I gotta tell you about this game-changing product I use for every night out with drinks [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2248.48s)]
*  It's called Pre-Alcohol [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2252.48s)]
*  Zbiotics Pre-Alcohol Probiotic Drink is the world's first genetically engineered probiotic [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2254.48s)]
*  It was invented by PhD scientists to tackle rough mornings after drinking [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2258.48s)]
*  Here's how it works. When you drink, alcohol gets converted into a toxic byproduct in the gut [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2262.48s)]
*  It's a buildup of this byproduct, not dehydration, that's to blame for rough days after drinking [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2266.48s)]
*  Pre-Alcohol produces an enzyme to break this byproduct down [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2271.48s)]
*  Just remember to make Pre-Alcohol your first drink of the night, drink responsibly, and you'll feel your best tomorrow [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2274.48s)]
*  I recently bought several hundred of these beautiful things [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2279.48s)]
*  Because I was having people over and they were like, I want a Pre-Alcohol, I want a Zbiotics [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2284.48s)]
*  So I was handing them out like candy, and I was running out, so I just bought a bunch [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2288.48s)]
*  I have a subscription, so mine just comes to the house [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2291.48s)]
*  I have a subscription too, but I was outpacing that bad boy [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2293.48s)]
*  Wow, that's exciting. We really like it [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2295.48s)]
*  I genuinely will not have 1.5 drinks without a Zbiotics first [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2298.48s)]
*  It works wonders for me. Give it a shot [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2304.48s)]
*  Summer is here, which means more opportunities to celebrate the warm weather [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2307.48s)]
*  Before that, backyard barbecue brew, glass of Pino watching the sunset at the beach, or cocktail by the campfire [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2310.48s)]
*  Don't forget your Zbiotics Pre-Alcohol [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2315.48s)]
*  Drink one before drinking and wake up feeling great and ready to take on the next day [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2317.48s)]
*  And all summer has to offer [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2321.48s)]

*  Alright, now if you're in the White House and you're dealing with all this [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2343.48s)]
*  You'd obviously rather direct your supporters attention elsewhere [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2347.48s)]
*  And so one thing you might do is let them know that you're launching new investigations into more deep state traders [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2351.48s)]
*  Sure enough, Fox News broke the story this week, of course Fox News [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2358.48s)]
*  That the administration is spinning up criminal investigations into former CIA Director John Brennan [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2362.48s)]
*  And former FBI Director James Comey [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2367.48s)]
*  Current CIA Director John Ratcliffe apparently has referred Brennan to the FBI for potential criminal prosecution [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2369.48s)]
*  He's also been charged with a criminal offense, allegedly for his testimony to Congress related to the inclusion of the Steele dossier [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2375.48s)]
*  In the agency's 2016 intelligence assessment on Russian interference [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2382.48s)]
*  Real callback to season one of this drama [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2386.48s)]
*  Maybe season two, early season [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2390.48s)]
*  Season one, it was season one, I think we can call it season one [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2393.48s)]
*  I mean, I guess if they'd gone after Hillary, that really wouldn't have been season one [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2396.48s)]
*  That's why I was going back and forth [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2400.48s)]
*  So it's not clear exactly what they plan to hang on James Comey [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2402.48s)]
*  But the Times is reporting that plainclothes Secret Service officers tailed Comey's car and tracked the location of his cell phone [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2406.48s)]
*  The day after he posted a photo of seashells spelling out 8647 back in May [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2414.48s)]
*  Which Trump World made a big show of treating as an incitement to a threat for assassination [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2420.48s)]
*  Secret Service visited Comey, that was another, that was a more recent episode [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2426.48s)]
*  Trump got asked about these potential investigations in that meeting we talked about earlier with African leaders on Wednesday [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2430.48s)]
*  Let's listen [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2437.48s)]
*  Well, I know nothing about it other than what I read today [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2438.48s)]
*  But I will tell you, I think they're very dishonest people [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2442.48s)]
*  I think they're crooked as hell [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2446.48s)]
*  And maybe they have to pay a price for that [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2448.48s)]
*  I believe they are truly bad people and dishonest people [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2452.48s)]
*  So whatever happens, happens [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2457.48s)]
*  Just absurd [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2459.48s)]
*  But what does he really think of them? [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2461.48s)]
*  I mean, how real do you think these investigations will be? [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2463.48s)]
*  Like clearly, and of course I know and worked with John Brennan when he was in the White House [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2469.48s)]
*  Like, and you know, I saw him on Nicole Wallace's show and he gave his first public comments there [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2475.48s)]
*  And he was like, you know, no one's reached out to me [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2482.48s)]
*  He's like, I read about it in the New York Times, I haven't gotten called by the FBI, I haven't gotten visited by anyone [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2485.48s)]
*  I have no idea what this is supposed to be about [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2489.48s)]
*  This is clearly going to be a huge pain in the ass for Brennan and Comey if these investigations unfold [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2492.48s)]
*  Do you think that's all or is it something worse? [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2500.48s)]
*  I think this is [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2504.48s)]
*  So the mechanism by which this is being executed is clownish, obviously, as so many other things are [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2507.48s)]
*  I don't think there's anything there [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2514.48s)]
*  They call to mind the Durham report, which already went through all of this, right? [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2516.48s)]
*  We know how this story ends [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2520.48s)]
*  The point is not the actual investigation [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2522.48s)]
*  The point is to reseed John Brennan and Jim Comey's names in the American sort of conversation [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2524.48s)]
*  And get, you know, MAGA world fired up about them [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2532.48s)]
*  It's a redirect from the Jeffrey Epstein stuff [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2535.48s)]
*  And that is a precarious place for any public person to be, right? [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2538.48s)]
*  You do not want the President of the United States to be talking about you [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2542.48s)]
*  Especially using that language, right? [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2546.48s)]
*  I think they're very bad people [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2548.48s)]
*  I think they're as crooked as they get whatever happens happens [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2550.48s)]
*  Like you talk about an incitement towards violence [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2553.48s)]
*  That's what it sounds like [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2555.48s)]
*  It's not a bunch of seashells on the beach [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2556.48s)]
*  Although what the fuck was Jim Comey thinking? [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2558.48s)]
*  Like what? [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2560.48s)]
*  Anyway, setting that aside [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2561.48s)]
*  That kind of language coming from Trump who begs to know nothing about this [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2563.48s)]
*  Which is hilarious because it's like, I mean, what is the one thing you have [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2567.48s)]
*  Is a bunch of stooges in office doing exactly what you want [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2570.48s)]
*  But the idea that, you know, it's, you know, they're just terrible people [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2573.48s)]
*  And it would be a shame if something happened to them [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2578.48s)]
*  This is kind of what I hear when I hear that [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2581.48s)]
*  And that's, so regardless of whether there's actually a fulsome investigation [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2583.48s)]
*  And whether they subpoena him or whatever happens [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2587.48s)]
*  It's the sense of vulnerability [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2589.48s)]
*  It's the sense of, I think, danger, imminent danger that this puts them in [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2591.48s)]
*  And I think the sort of long tail of this is any public official, right? [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2595.48s)]
*  I mean, it's already we're seeing purges at the DOJ [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2601.48s)]
*  Already we have whistleblowers, right? [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2603.48s)]
*  Anybody who stands up to Trump, whether he's president or even in his post-presidency [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2605.48s)]
*  You know, this is the kind of thing that gives you pause, right? [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2610.48s)]
*  Like, do I really want to do this? [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2613.48s)]
*  Because like, even when I think it's over [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2615.48s)]
*  Even when season two has passed and we're in season three, season four [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2617.48s)]
*  We may be even in season five [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2621.48s)]
*  Like, somehow Trump will go back or Trump's allies will go back [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2623.48s)]
*  And when it suits them and when it's politically expedient for them [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2628.48s)]
*  They will go back to it to stoke rage and animosity for nothing [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2633.48s)]
*  But, I mean, for a goal no bigger than personal gain and political survival [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2640.48s)]
*  So that's dangerous [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2646.48s)]
*  And I think that is the thing that matters in this [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2648.48s)]
*  Maybe more than the actual investigation itself [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2652.48s)]
*  Yeah, and look, there's also a lot of space between a nuisance and being worried that your life is being threatened by this, right? [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2655.48s)]
*  Which is, they start an investigation about one thing and then they keep going [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2666.48s)]
*  And maybe they don't find anything but they leak a bunch of the investigation just to embarrass them, to publicly shame them [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2673.48s)]
*  So there's that that they have to worry about too [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2679.48s)]
*  And once they investigate those two, then they start getting statements from other people [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2681.48s)]
*  And it all becomes a thing about like, do you entrap people with false statements and all that kind of shit [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2685.48s)]
*  And so it is a recipe for the kind of dangerous politicization of the Justice Department of our criminal justice system [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2690.48s)]
*  That, you know, I don't think, you know, publicly a lot of people are going to look at this and even people who are like Democrats [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2701.48s)]
*  And Democrats be like, oh, I'm sure they didn't do anything wrong and it's fine, but whatever [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2708.48s)]
*  But it's like, it's not going to stop at James Comey and John Brennan at all [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2711.48s)]
*  And what it does is it just sends a message to everyone, whether in the government or out of the government [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2716.48s)]
*  That you cross these people and we're going to send FBI, DOJ after you [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2722.48s)]
*  And within the FBI and the DOJ, I'm sure they might have some problems finding people who are going to do these investigations and take these cases [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2727.48s)]
*  But if you're those people, you're thinking to yourself, okay, do I say no and lose my job or do I go along with it? [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2734.48s)]
*  Well, it's like, it's like revenge and like the idea that there are good people in there who are like, well, wait a second [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2741.48s)]
*  Are we just going to take a middle finger to justice? And some people do. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2746.48s)]
*  Yep. So Trump isn't just taking revenge on the deep state. He's attempting to purge most of the federal government of anyone who's not completely loyal to him with mixed results [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2750.48s)]
*  This week, the Supreme Court greenlit Trump's plan to fire hundreds of thousands of nonpartisan, nonpolitical civil servants [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2761.48s)]
*  Challenge for Trump is that there aren't enough Fox News hosts and podcast hosts to staff an entire administration [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2766.48s)]
*  Though he is certainly trying. Marco Rubio's got four jobs now. Todd Blanche has a few. Stephen Miller's running just about everything [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2772.48s)]
*  And now, former Real World Road Rules and Real World Road Rules Challenge star [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2780.48s)]
*  I wanted to make sure he gets credit for all three of his reality shows that he's been in. Sean Duffy. He's apparently going to run NASA [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2787.48s)]
*  At least for the time being, as well as the Department of Transportation, where he has had some trouble keeping all the planes in the skies [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2794.48s)]
*  Meanwhile, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem seems to be struggling to balance all her duties with her press hits and photo ops [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2802.48s)]
*  FEMA officials just told CNN they had to wait days to get the funding necessary to respond to the devastating Texas floods [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2809.48s)]
*  Thanks to a new rule that requires Noem's personal signature on any expenditure over $100,000 [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2816.48s)]
*  The official said that normally they'd pre-stage search and rescue teams to areas they know will flood. They weren't able to do that this time [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2822.48s)]
*  Noem didn't provide the approval for those assets until Monday, more than 72 hours after the flooding started [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2829.48s)]
*  But she did find time on Sunday to ask her Instagram followers which equestrian portrait of her they'd like to see hanging in the South Dakota state capitals [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2835.48s)]
*  So, you know, there is that. I mean, who among us hasn't gotten sidetracked from really urgent work matters? [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2842.48s)]
*  Trying to figure out which equestrian portrait to hang. Who among us doesn't have multiple equestrian photos to choose from? [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2850.48s)]
*  A lot to choose from. I mean, we talk about Sophie's Choice, but I wish if only there was a Department of Government Efficiency that could look at that [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2856.48s)]
*  incredibly inefficient government setup that we have and figure out a way to streamline it [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2864.48s)]
*  It's not, I mean, I say that, but it's like, can you imagine being the parent of one of these children and reading the story? [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2869.48s)]
*  It is un-fucking-fathomable. Like, first of all, $100,000 for an organization like FEMA is effectively asking, you know, [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2880.48s)]
*  your accountant to approve every $5 expenditure. You'd be spending all day on the phone with your accountant. It totally hamstrings FEMA [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2891.48s)]
*  And we haven't seen the worst of this. Like, we're going to have multiple natural disasters that we have to contend with [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2898.48s)]
*  both because it's hurricane and wildfire season and we're burning the earth up at an alarming rate. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2904.48s)]
*  So, you know, this is one of those things where you want to hear this charge being led by people affected directly by these disasters [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2909.48s)]
*  like asking questions. This is where if I were in Kerrville or I were in Texas or just as an American citizen, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2919.48s)]
*  there have got to be answers about this, right? If there's truly a delay, if Texas isn't getting the deployment of federal resources that it needs, [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2925.48s)]
*  I think that there's more reporting that like they didn't have enough people to answer the disaster call center because she hadn't approved extra [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2932.48s)]
*  you know, federal support for that, you know, they needed more data for their search and rescue operations, but they didn't have the cooperation of the federal government. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2939.48s)]
*  I don't know if an equestrian portrait takes that long to decide upon, but this is someone either who is in the most, I'll be the most generous I can be [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2947.48s)]
*  either so overwhelmed with work that she cannot delegate in a way that she must or who is just completely out to lunch and out of her league [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2957.48s)]
*  in like the most urgent and pressing matters of like human survival, right? So, but none of it's excusable. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2967.48s)]
*  None of it's excusable. And now we have, I'm sorry, I just need to go back to like the road world's champ running NASA. Like if you wrote it in a screenplay, John. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2975.48s)]
*  Because he's been doing such a good job at transportation. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2985.48s)]
*  It's me. Well, road rules taught him so much about the road. Why can't he apply that to zero gravity? What is happening? [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2988.48s)]
*  Well, see this. Okay, let's even if we lived in a world, let's just live in an imaginary world where all these people have the best intentions, right? [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=2996.48s)]
*  And they want to do right by the American people and they want to they want to serve the public as they're supposed to do. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3004.48s)]
*  When you hollow out government and fire people who aren't loyalists and just, you know, send the Doge teams in and all the rest of the bullshit that's happened since January. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3009.48s)]
*  Like this is what's going to happen. You're just going to get ranking competence when you fill the administration with Fox News hosts at the cabinet level. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3021.48s)]
*  People who've never done any of this shit before. You're going to have these problems, even if you had the best intentions, which, you know, we can. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3029.48s)]
*  I don't really have a lot of hope that they do. So, of course, this is going to fucking happen. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3038.48s)]
*  And of course, it's going to get worse. And, you know, there's there's two big consequences to hollowing out the government and to the way that Trump has staffed the government. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3043.48s)]
*  One we just talked about, which is you get loyalists who are going to do your bidding and not do the bidding of the American people and go after people and take revenge and just basically be your sort of personal patronage, you know, army out there. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3051.48s)]
*  And you just you're going to hollow a government, not have enough good qualified people to just do the basic functions that need to be done in government. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3065.48s)]
*  And the most basic function is protecting the American people and helping them when natural disasters hit. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3073.48s)]
*  Well, and I would say it's exacerbated. Not only is there the incompetence and the cravenness, there's also the stupidity of making the job even harder by saying, you know, passing rules like every expenditure over one hundred thousand dollars. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3079.48s)]
*  I have to personally sign off on. I mean, this is this is making a job that you are already unqualified for that much harder. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3094.48s)]
*  And it's not just like sort of sitting on the sidelines and cackling as these people, you know, are are incapable of doing their jobs. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3101.48s)]
*  There is a very real human consequence here. And that's what makes it so unacceptable. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3111.48s)]
*  But I mean, again, this is a thing where it's like you have to keep I mean, the people that the questions need to be. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3116.48s)]
*  I mean, what what really truly needs to happen? And this is that the sort of will. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3124.48s)]
*  I'm always asking myself, are there is this a catalytic moment? Is this a moment where you really see citizen outrage on the level where you need to see it? [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3128.48s)]
*  You need to see it from these are people who are losing family members or their entire, you know, their their their life in these catastrophic floods. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3137.48s)]
*  Like, will they ask the questions? Will they hold these people accountable? Because this will keep happening. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3145.48s)]
*  I mean, this is not a one off, right? It's only going to get worse. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3151.48s)]
*  Yeah. And we're only at the beginning of hurricane season, you know, even this year. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3154.48s)]
*  So one person with with both the courage to speak out about this and the power to do something about it was retiring North Carolina Senator Tom Tillis, who this week explained to Jake Tapper why he did neither of those things on on two big administration nominations just this year. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3159.48s)]
*  Here's a sampling. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3179.48s)]
*  Well, you know, first, I need to set the record straight on Hecce. With the passing of time, I think it's clear he's out of his depth as a manager of a large complex organization based on the information I have today. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3180.48s)]
*  If all I had was the information on the day of the vote, I'd certainly vote for him again. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3190.48s)]
*  But now I have the information of him being a manager. And I don't think that as probationary period has been very positive. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3194.48s)]
*  Quite honestly, if the main reason I supported Kennedy was because Bill Cassidy thought that we should see how it plays out. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3203.48s)]
*  Just it makes me so mad. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3212.48s)]
*  With the passing of time, with the passing. First of all, I have the information. We all have the information. We all have the information that he couldn't run a nonprofit. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3218.48s)]
*  Why did we think that he would be able to run the Pentagon? Nobody. Nobody thought he could run the organization. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3229.48s)]
*  And, you know, the idea that these Republicans can actually say the truth only when they're no longer running for office. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3236.48s)]
*  There is there is a special place in the underworld for people who know better. I think in all of this. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3244.48s)]
*  It is one thing if you've been fed a steady diet of misinformation and you've grown up in the far, you know, stretches, the farthest right corner of the universe and you really genuinely don't know better, which is, you know, a strange and unfortunate place to live. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3251.48s)]
*  But Tom Tillis knows better. Tom Tillis knew better. And the fact that he can only find moral fortitude or a backbone or, you know, some part of his frontal lobe. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3266.48s)]
*  Once he's decided not to run, I think makes the admission and the, you know, the not even a mea culpa. It makes it even worse. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3277.48s)]
*  Like in on some level, it might have been better if he had just shut up and not said this, because I find it utterly enraging. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3287.48s)]
*  And what's even worse is we know from a lot of reporting that during the Hegseth nomination, MAGA folks like leaned on Tillis threatened Tillis. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3293.48s)]
*  He felt threatened for offering some mild criticism and maybe suggesting that he wasn't going to vote for him. So we already know that story. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3304.48s)]
*  And like the idea that Tommy Tillis wouldn't just be like, you know, he could have had a moment where you're like, yeah, no, I was I was threatened and these people are crazy. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3311.48s)]
*  And now I'm retiring to get away from this. Like he could have just said that and not had to pretend that is all the information I had at the time or like Bill Cassidy. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3318.48s)]
*  How about our R.F.K. Jr. Bill Cassidy made me do it. Blame Bill Cassidy. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3327.48s)]
*  Just like that t-shirt with an arrow. But also the passage of time. It's like, bro, there's been no passage of time. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3332.48s)]
*  It's like yesterday that these guys were confirmed. What are you talking about? Nice try. We're still living in this time space continuum. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3338.48s)]
*  We all have the information. Don't even try it to try and pretend that like he's come to a realization after the passage of time, given more information. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3345.48s)]
*  If he'd known then what he knows now, I mean, give me a break. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3354.48s)]
*  It's just so and he's like just watching him and he's like, you know, he's got a pep in his step now and he's feeling better. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3358.48s)]
*  You know, everyone should watch the rest of the interview with Tapper. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3365.48s)]
*  And, you know, he does say like plenty of critical things about the Trump White House, which makes you realize like where were you when you were when you thought you might be running for reelection and how many other Republican senators are thinking the same thing and just doing this bullshit anyway. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3368.48s)]
*  Still in year 10 of this, this is why I feel like there really is a special place in the underworld for people to know better and continue on and just say it's because it's just a revelation that it's it's just power. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3383.48s)]
*  And once power is the pursuit of power over literally everything else, including our democracy. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3395.48s)]
*  And once you relinquish that fight for power or the fight to hold on for power, you can actually be a person with integrity. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3400.48s)]
*  I mean, that's just you've ceded your integrity once you've made that bargain. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3407.48s)]
*  Let's talk about what Democrats are doing and not doing. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3411.48s)]
*  It's been a week since Trump signed his economic plan into law. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3414.48s)]
*  And according to a new report from Lauren Egan at the Bulwark, some Democratic electeds are getting cold feet about going on offense because the popular parts of the bill, like the thousand dollar investment accounts for newborns and no tax on tips on overtime or overtime, they go into effect right away. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3418.48s)]
*  And of course, the Medicaid cuts or at least most of the Medicaid cuts and most of the snap cuts don't kick in until later in the piece. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3437.48s)]
*  Democratic pollster, Selinda Lakes, says she's worried about voters concluding that Democrats are just crying wolf again. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3444.48s)]
*  What do you think of of that? [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3451.48s)]
*  I worry. I do worry. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3453.48s)]
*  I mean, I think the fact that the Medicaid cuts are delayed until after the twenty twenty six midterms and that there are going to be other sweeteners that kick in before then the American public has the attention span of a fruit fly. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3455.48s)]
*  I mean, I will I will never forget, John. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3465.48s)]
*  And we talked about this. I think I had you as a guest on my MSNBC show when I went to Michigan and talked to like twenty five year old union workers who were working on projects that were funded by the Inflation Reduction Act that were literally being put to work by something. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3468.48s)]
*  Joe Biden, the Democrats passed, and they both did not give Biden credit for that and were much more interested in Donald Trump. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3484.48s)]
*  So just because something in Washington seems like it should either benefit or harm one group of people doesn't necessarily mean that the fallout will fall along the logical lines. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3491.48s)]
*  And I think it's entirely possible that this is one of those things, in part because it's massive. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3503.48s)]
*  It was passed in the dead of night. People are going to hold on to different parts of it. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3509.48s)]
*  And like you said, people won't feel necessarily the worst effects of it for a little while. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3512.48s)]
*  And so I do think it's incumbent on Democrats. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3516.48s)]
*  I mean, listen, I think the whole the party needs to be more proactive generally. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3519.48s)]
*  Right. Like this, it's so much of a responsive, back footed stance. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3523.48s)]
*  And there needs to be so I mean, I get it. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3528.48s)]
*  Like, it's hard. They're not the governing majority. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3532.48s)]
*  Trump every day is setting something on fire. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3534.48s)]
*  But the party needs to coalesce and figure out its priorities and then get aggressive because just simply being a receptacle for Trump dissatisfaction or outrage is not going to be enough in the next two years. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3537.48s)]
*  Yeah. And it look, it may be enough in the midterms. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3548.48s)]
*  But I also think, of course, Democrats should put together a proactive vision for what they want to get done. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3552.48s)]
*  Now, I think there's a challenge, which is you you want to put together a forward looking agenda and something that will actually inspire people to vote for you. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3560.48s)]
*  Not just that you're not the Donald Trump or not Republicans. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3570.48s)]
*  But Democrats also can't promise, at least in an advance of the midterms, that that agenda has any chance of being enacted if you if you vote for a Democratic Congress. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3574.48s)]
*  OK, first of all, I'll just say I think the House is one thing, the Senate's another. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3585.48s)]
*  And I know Democrats have designs on the Senate because of the passage of the one big, beautiful bill. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3588.48s)]
*  And I do think that that's where you know, that's where I think everything should be handled like healthy amount of skepticism should attend any predictions that they need to make. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3593.48s)]
*  Some of these harder seats are going to be easier wins because of this bill. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3603.48s)]
*  Right. I do think the American public is largely smart enough to know that the Democrats can't pass anything until they are given power. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3606.48s)]
*  But I do think there needs to be some kind of statement of principles because it does feel a bit rudderless. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3618.48s)]
*  And it is hard because the Democratic Party really is, as my colleague and friend, Nicole Wallace, always says, like, it's the pro-democracy coalition. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3624.48s)]
*  Right. It's a massive tent and figuring out how to sift through the the the remains of the election and even what's happening in the Trump administration, what to prioritize is going to be really difficult. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3631.48s)]
*  But it is OK to be quiet now and circle wagons. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3643.48s)]
*  But I do think there needs to be something that is not about Trump, but it is about the Democratic Party and what the party stands for. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3647.48s)]
*  And there's a statement of priorities because I don't see it right now. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3654.48s)]
*  And around affordability. And I think because partly because we also have to be honest about how people feel and what has gone into effect. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3658.48s)]
*  Right. Like we can't the worry about the Medicaid cuts not take not hitting until after the midterms. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3668.48s)]
*  That is real and that is valid. And what we can't do is go out there and just pretend that they've happened when they haven't happened. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3674.48s)]
*  So you could see and but also, as we know, whether you're a Democratic or Republican president or Democratic and Republican Congress, people hold you responsible for how they're feeling in their own lives. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3680.48s)]
*  And if prices have not come down, if people if the trade war kicks up again, if interest rates are still high, which clearly Trump knows, which is why he's like threatening to fire Jerome Powell every day. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3690.48s)]
*  If the lived experience of most voters by the time we get to next November is not great or has not improved, then the worry about specific provisions of the bill and when they take effect, I think will fade into the background a little bit. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3702.48s)]
*  But that's still your point remains, which is Democrats should be fighting that not just by saying we're not that. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3716.48s)]
*  But like once you know, if you put us into power in 26 and then in 28, if we win, this is the agenda that we want to pass. This is what we want to do for people. Like I think that is critical. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3723.48s)]
*  And I think even immigration like that could be a more resonant issue given the draconian approach Trump has taken. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3733.48s)]
*  But it's not just about saying this is wrong and telling the stories. That's the first piece of it. The second is what are you going to do? Like, what's the plan? Yeah. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3740.48s)]
*  Which is hard. Well, as you said, you know, the party has a number of different efforts to to find a pathway out of the wilderness here. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3749.48s)]
*  There's the latest is from a band of about 30 Democratic officials that launched this week. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3758.48s)]
*  It's called Majority Democrats, which the New York Times describes as, quote, a number of prominent younger Democrats with records of winning tough races who have, quote, big ambitions to remake their party's image, recruit a new wave of candidates and challenge political orthodoxies. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3764.48s)]
*  They say are holding the party back. Some of the names involved, Abigail Spanberger, Mikey Sherrill, Ruben Gallego, Alyssa Slotkin. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3778.48s)]
*  So some of the big names in the Democratic Party, up and coming big names in the Democratic Party. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3786.48s)]
*  They say there's no ideological litmus test and they don't have a policy agenda just yet. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3790.48s)]
*  But several Democrats involved told the Times they're focused on issues around, quote, affordability, safety, challenging the power of big tech. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3795.48s)]
*  What do you think? Good idea. Bad idea. Need more info. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3802.48s)]
*  I mean, I'm not going to dismiss anything. First of all, I think this should be a moment of like, Kaleida, of like policy rumspringa. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3807.48s)]
*  You know what I mean? I feel like everybody should be like going for it. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3813.48s)]
*  And I think if there's one thing Democrats should learn from the example of the Trump administration and MAGA world is be not afraid. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3817.48s)]
*  Like, go out there like it is one thing. I mean, it is the one thing I'll give them is like there is a boldness with which she has acted. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3824.48s)]
*  And I do think the American public wants they want forward movement. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3833.48s)]
*  And I think, you know, Democrats obviously need to think about electability. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3838.48s)]
*  They need to think about what's going to win. But I think this is the moment when there should be, you know, a lot of spitballing. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3842.48s)]
*  And if this group filled with winners can create an environment where people can talk really strategically, [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3848.48s)]
*  but also also with frankness and looseness and like come up with ideas. I'm all for it. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3856.48s)]
*  I think my concern is like I don't just want it to be about what wins because I think that is a I mean, it's obviously a hugely important piece of this. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3863.48s)]
*  But like there need there needs to be like this is the Petri dish part of the of the science experiment. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3873.48s)]
*  And there needs to be a sense of I mean, as dark as these times are, it is a moment where so much is possible. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3879.48s)]
*  You know, like you like there are a lot of ideas that could fly like we exist in a climate where the unthinkable is happening. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3888.48s)]
*  And that is largely being interpreted in the sort of negative. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3898.48s)]
*  But I also think the old ways are outmoded in a lot of respects. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3903.48s)]
*  And therefore, that's huge opportunity. And Democrats should try and capture some of that possibility. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3907.48s)]
*  And to the extent that they can be joyful and creative about what the solutions are. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3914.48s)]
*  And the party really needs to recapture that because there's so much sorrow and sadness and a lot of it is well placed. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3919.48s)]
*  But now is the time to experiment and to and to be big. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3926.48s)]
*  And so if there's a bunch of new people coming up with like, you know, a lunchtime sandwich conclave to talk about what has to happen, like, go for it. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3930.48s)]
*  You know, do it, do it, like, go forth and truly prosper. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3942.48s)]
*  Because like without that excitement of new ideas and new strategies, I don't I don't know what happens in twenty twenty eight. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3946.48s)]
*  But like the one thing about MAGA, the one thing about Trump, you go to those rallies, you hear him speak. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3953.48s)]
*  There is a passion and a verb and an excitement and a feeling of like kinetic energy. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3958.48s)]
*  And I largely find it like much of it morally abominable. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3963.48s)]
*  But that is something that like the left needs to find. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3969.48s)]
*  So I guess that's my feeling about it. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3972.48s)]
*  No, I mean, Donald Trump promised has been promising since 2015 to burn it all down. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3975.48s)]
*  And in this term, he is doing his very best to burn it all down. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3983.48s)]
*  And whatever remains is not going to be much. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3987.48s)]
*  And the the silver lining there is we can think about how to rebuild from scratch this this country and this government that Donald Trump is doing his best to destroy. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=3991.48s)]
*  And I do think that can help us push us to think outside the box. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4000.48s)]
*  I don't think voters vote for people based on like a checklist of policies. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4004.48s)]
*  And but I do think that, you know, one thing that's similar to Donald Trump's elections and even just for a more recent example, Zoran Mondani Mondani's election is there were policy ideas, but they were their policy ideas that are sort of easy to latch on to. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4009.48s)]
*  They grab your attention. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4028.48s)]
*  And they stick in the mind like, oh, you know that Zoran is for freezing the rent, right? [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4030.48s)]
*  You just that you know that you know it free city buses just broke through. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4036.48s)]
*  And Donald Trump is rebuilding the wall. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4039.48s)]
*  You just knew that. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4041.48s)]
*  And you kind of you need these policy ideas that are that are big, bold, but also easily accessible. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4042.48s)]
*  Stick with people. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4048.48s)]
*  Go directly to what their concerns and hopes are, which is been around affordability for a couple of decades now. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4050.48s)]
*  But certainly over the last couple years when inflation hit. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4057.48s)]
*  So, you know, I think that figuring those policies out and then like you said, they got to be good. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4060.48s)]
*  We have some fresh ones, too. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4066.48s)]
*  Right. Like, I mean, totally. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4067.48s)]
*  We always joke about this, but like we've been I've been in Democratic politics for 20 years. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4069.48s)]
*  And oh, my God, we laugh. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4072.48s)]
*  No. Oh, my God. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4074.48s)]
*  But you're right, too. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4076.48s)]
*  But we laugh about how many times like, you know, Democratic politicians are out there being like, I'm going to I'm going to give tax breaks to companies that create jobs here in America and stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4078.48s)]
*  It's the same shit that has pulled well for 20 years and pollsters will tell you it pulls well. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4090.48s)]
*  But it's like you can't you need to break through and you need to grab people's attention. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4094.48s)]
*  So big and bold. Yes. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4098.48s)]
*  But also new. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4100.48s)]
*  And I do think. Yeah. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4102.48s)]
*  And not too many, but just a couple that really grab people. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4103.48s)]
*  Be free. Think of it as ideas Woodstock. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4106.48s)]
*  I mean, I know it's hard. Right. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4110.48s)]
*  But it is it is it is a remarkable moment in American politics for a party to fully not reinvent itself, but be wholly responsive to this kind of, you know, moment of of uncertainty and look at it as a moment of opportunity. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4112.48s)]
*  I know that sounds Pollyanna or like overwrought or whatever, but I do think capturing some sense of opportunity and like ambition about in this moment is essential. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4130.48s)]
*  One last thing I got here on my list. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4140.48s)]
*  Need to get your thoughts on Nazi Grock. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4142.48s)]
*  Speaking of uncertainty and ambition. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4146.48s)]
*  That's that's how we're going to end. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4149.48s)]
*  You know, last Friday, Elon Musk, Elon Musk announced that Grock had been improved and was better than ever. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4151.48s)]
*  So people started testing that proposition and in response to various questions, admittedly leading Grock did the following. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4158.48s)]
*  Praise Hitler went on an insane rant against people with Jewish last names, vividly described a theoretical sexual encounter with Twitter CEO Linda Yacarino, who stepped down on Thursday. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4168.48s)]
*  Then overnight, just last night, we're recording this on a Thursday. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4182.48s)]
*  Elon said that the new version, the new new version has been released and this one you're going to be able to have in your Tesla. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4186.48s)]
*  So I don't know if you'd be driving around your Tesla and hearing Hitler praise or or what. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4193.48s)]
*  But this is this is what's happening. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4199.48s)]
*  It's all happening on X, the everything app. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4202.48s)]
*  I mean, it's just perfect. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4205.48s)]
*  It's exactly what we should expect. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4209.48s)]
*  I got an email at one point a long time ago. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4213.48s)]
*  I was thinking of buying a Tesla and I like somehow got on their mailing list and it was this long kind of like a mission statement about Tesla's commitment to the environment. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4215.48s)]
*  And I very quickly I almost wrote back like how dare how dare you like go fuck yourself. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4224.48s)]
*  Like you have betrayed the fundamental principles of all the things that are good about environmentalism and that I mean, just how dare you try to do this right now. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4233.48s)]
*  I think it was on Grok Nazi Day that this went up. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4245.48s)]
*  So so like this both tells me that we're doomed. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4250.48s)]
*  I know I just write like this is this is also like an AI. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4254.48s)]
*  This is an AI discussion as much as it is an X discussion. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4258.48s)]
*  I left Twitter like a long time ago because I just couldn't keep up. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4263.48s)]
*  And then I had every excuse in the world because it's a toxic swamp. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4267.48s)]
*  But but you know, I guess the theme of this episode is like you you get what you pay for. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4270.48s)]
*  Like this is this is a person who has, you know, took X over to allow the flourishing of like hate speech hate speech and misinformation. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4278.48s)]
*  And I mean, are we surprised that this is the thing that he built? [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4288.48s)]
*  I honestly read about this and I was like, I don't I don't. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4295.48s)]
*  By the way, Linda Yakarino insists that her like leaving the company had nothing to do with any of this. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4299.48s)]
*  Which may which could be very true. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4305.48s)]
*  Coincidental entirely coincidental. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4308.48s)]
*  I mean, like when was a lot how many of us have had lewd AI like Nazi bots like explaining sexual fantasies about us. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4310.48s)]
*  And, you know, that's a Tuesday. That's a Tuesday. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4318.48s)]
*  So, I mean, why would you I do think it probably for me at least it's it's definitely more of an AI story. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4321.48s)]
*  And also the limits of what artificial intelligence is going to be able to do the dangers of what it could do. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4327.48s)]
*  And but but the limits of what it can do, at least in relation to what people in Silicon Valley like Elon Musk, like Peter Thiel, like all these other assholes think that it can do, which is we're going to create something so intelligent that it's going to be able to solve all the problems that these messy humans have not been able to solve. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4334.48s)]
*  And especially these idiots in government. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4355.48s)]
*  Right. Because but we are going to create the superintelligence. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4357.48s)]
*  Like the intelligence is based on all the rest of the shit that's out there in the world that is put into the world by humans, including some very awful humans who said the kind of things on X that Grok has been trained on. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4360.48s)]
*  And so at the very best, you're always going to get an amalgamation or artificial intelligence is always going to be an amalgamation of like everyone else's intelligence of us. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4376.48s)]
*  Right. For all for ill and for mostly ill. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4385.48s)]
*  Yeah. So like, well, we're pretty ill right now. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4389.48s)]
*  And and if we want to build the if we think we're going to have these systems, these AI systems that we're supposed to trust to give us like factual information and the truth. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4392.48s)]
*  And we already have a crisis and trust in this country that has led us here. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4401.48s)]
*  And this shit's going to happen. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4405.48s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know. Yeah, I mean, and I do worry there's like a whole subset of people for whom it's like, well, finally validation and vindication about, you know, my like great race theory. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4408.48s)]
*  Right. I proving the case, you know, I mean, that is the other dark side of this is there's a whole bunch of people who are like, why did you have to change the algorithm seemed fine to me. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4417.48s)]
*  Yeah, I just I mean, it's like you eat poison, you get poison. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4424.48s)]
*  And that's kind of where we're at. Little Grok, little Grok is just feeding on the shit of the 21st century. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4429.48s)]
*  And so it goes that is for a man who like loves shoveling shit. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4435.48s)]
*  So here we are. Grok. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4441.48s)]
*  Well, that is a perfect place to end. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4445.48s)]
*  Yeah, cool. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4448.48s)]

*  Joining us today is Ana Ramon, Executive Director of the Texas Leadership Pipeline and Annie's List, [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4673.48s)]
*  two organizations that recruit, train, and help elect Democrats up and down the ballot in Texas. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4679.48s)]
*  Ana and Texas Leadership Pipeline recently partnered with Vote Save America as part of our effort to help our audience, [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4683.48s)]
*  people just like you, run for office in Texas, Arizona, and North Carolina. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4689.48s)]
*  We wanted to have her on to talk a little bit about that effort, what it'll take to turn Texas blue, [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4694.48s)]
*  and why you shouldn't be afraid to take the plunge and run for office in your community. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4698.48s)]
*  Ana, welcome to the pod. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4703.48s)]
*  Thank you for having me. Excited to be here. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4704.48s)]
*  So first and foremost, can you tell us a little bit about the work that you do with Texas Leadership Pipeline? [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4706.48s)]
*  Absolutely. A lot of it is the quiet behind the scenes sneaking around, you know, classic Texas politics activities. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4712.48s)]
*  Of course. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4720.48s)]
*  We want to find the next County Commissioner of Hood County. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4721.48s)]
*  We want to find the next County Commissioner of Nueces County. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4725.48s)]
*  We want to dig deep. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4727.48s)]
*  And what that takes is that qualitative and quantitative approach to building what we term a groundswell of candidates coming from the top, [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4729.48s)]
*  not only the top four counties, but what is the top 10, the top 25 counties, as you mentioned, [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4738.48s)]
*  turning Texas blue will take people pushing up as much as it takes people pushing down. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4743.48s)]
*  So it's having those one-on-one conversations with candidates. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4749.48s)]
*  It's helping candidates understand how much it really takes to get from signing your name up and putting your $25 down to raising your [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4752.48s)]
*  rent per state house like one point two million to take out a Republican candidate. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4760.48s)]
*  Right. So it's all that in between. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4764.48s)]
*  And what's really exciting is getting to meet the people along the way and really testing them out in Texas across what I would deem six states in one state. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4767.48s)]
*  Yeah. So you guys have you have races all up and down the ballot and you're trying to recruit candidates for races all up and down the ballot. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4776.48s)]
*  And I realize there's a lot of uncontested races. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4786.48s)]
*  And by uncontested, I mean, there's a Republican and there's not even a Democrat running. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4791.48s)]
*  And can you give us an idea, at least in Texas, like what is the scope of races that go uncontested? [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4796.48s)]
*  Why aren't they contested? And like, are they unwinnable or are they just races that we might be able to win if we could just find candidates to run? [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4805.48s)]
*  Well, I'm sure these fun facts have been shared on the pod before. We have 254 counties. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4814.48s)]
*  We have thousands of support races. We have thousands of city council races, countless commissioner races. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4820.48s)]
*  And what it takes is both that really the people power and investing in individuals, but it also takes resources to really think about what does a six region, six state approach look like in Texas? [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4826.48s)]
*  When I talk to national entities and organizations, I ask them, like, when you look at Texas, do you think about us in a Virginia to the Carolinas kind of aspect? [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4838.48s)]
*  And we need the kind of people who are willing to run almost in multi-states to really get that same ROI. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4848.48s)]
*  You know, we're looking at who knows how much opportunity and that's what we see in the people who are in Texas. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4854.48s)]
*  So it takes what we see is more of that people power and having essentially strong conduits and platforms like yourselves teaming up with us to really reach an audience that we wouldn't normally get a chance to talk to. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4860.48s)]
*  We have to democratize the very un-democratic process of running campaigns, right? I'm sure you know this better than I do. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4872.48s)]
*  Like we live in a world where barriers exist to raising money, to actually understanding what makes sense for you to run for, to even like, what does it mean to run for office? [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4880.48s)]
*  Like there are barriers along the way. What data does it take to get there? [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4889.48s)]
*  So what we're trying to do is that wide net of catching people who aren't that untraditional candidate. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4892.48s)]
*  We have to find those individuals, those untraditional, non-traditional candidates. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4899.48s)]
*  It's what's going to get us people who can outperform top of ticket, who understand their district, understand their community. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4903.48s)]
*  And I would almost argue most importantly, understand themselves to really go against the barriers that are erected in Texas. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4909.48s)]
*  We always joke about being Texas tough. I'm like maybe more like Texas punched in the teeth like to run for office. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4915.48s)]
*  Like it's a tough role and you need people who are willing to not be afraid of the far right pushback, not be afraid of even personal and individual attacks, right? [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4922.48s)]
*  Even like physical attacks and what that can mean. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4932.48s)]
*  So what that looks like is really doing that large catch. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4936.48s)]
*  At this point, we've been able to identify about 35,000 people outside of the major cores that want to run for office in Texas. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4940.48s)]
*  But we also have, of course, the quantitative piece and the qualitative piece is the individuals. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4947.48s)]
*  We have three full-time scouts who are on the ground year round talking to people at running office, creating warming events where we get people in the room. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4953.48s)]
*  And last but not least, even knocking on doors and dragging them to go sign up to run because that's what it takes to get someone to run in Oyster Creek, Texas. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4961.48s)]
*  Right. So there's a lot in between that. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4968.48s)]
*  But ultimately having again these kind of partnerships and relationships with folks like Vote Save America, you guys are able to talk to a whole group of people who we just don't have access to as much as I like to think like when I tweet out, I get 1.9 million listeners. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4971.48s)]
*  That's just not the case. But it could be folks like at home who are listening to this right now, who is, you know, a mom having a margarita or or like a dad who just got home off of work. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4986.48s)]
*  Like we need those individuals who understand who they are in their community to really take on the apparatus, which is the far right and the effort to control not only the soul of Texas, but the soul of our union. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=4997.48s)]
*  So I am sure that for a lot of people listening who might live in Texas, people who live in Texas, who've never thought about running for office or maybe who thought about it, but sort of shied away from it. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5009.48s)]
*  A couple barriers may be like one, I don't know if I have the right background. I don't know if I have the right skills for this. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5023.48s)]
*  I don't, you know, I'm not well known enough. What if I can't raise money? Do I really is, you know, I'm just kind of scared like, you know, some of the threats that you talked about, but also just scared of like, even if we didn't live in this awful political environment, just putting yourself out there. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5032.48s)]
*  You know, what are some of the things that you guys and your recruiters like talk to people about who are maybe who've thought about running for office, but either decided against it or just sort of on the fence? [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5049.48s)]
*  I have to be brutally honest with people, right? Brutally honest about like, how much it'll take the raise, especially on the type of election in Texas and the realities of our state, of course. But I also talk about their why. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5061.48s)]
*  I think that's such a critical point because if you do not understand intrinsically why you want to do it, you are more prone to getting torn and quartered in this space. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5074.48s)]
*  But like, for example, give an example. I recruited a candidate out of the Las Palapas on Broadway, shout out San Antonio, over a Margarita. And she knew after seeing the health care system, seeing what happened to her family and everything, what it would mean for her to run. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5086.48s)]
*  And the next day she found it within herself to raise over months, eight to seven hundred thousand dollars to run for a race. And granted, that's not the typical, the norm, but it's just awakening sometimes that intrinsic thought that truly people who come from less can achieve more. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5102.48s)]
*  And people who have done less have run for more. Like, those are barriers, truly. But you can be the more in your community that takes us because I can say this from personal experience. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5123.48s)]
*  I've done five as the kind of six and a half legislative sessions and multiple cycles in the in both the House and the Texas Senate. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5135.48s)]
*  The right person in the wrong room or the right person in the wrong room can make an incredible difference. So to your point, yes, there are barriers, but understanding your why, understanding the realities of running, not running away from those realities and then partnering with folks. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5143.48s)]
*  Like, which is really exciting, like with Annie's List, but also, you know, Latino Victory Fund, you know, run for something, entities that can help you get to that next point and tracks that we can put you on. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5159.48s)]
*  It's not so daunting when you realize you're not alone running. Right. That actually actually gets me through a lot of the work in our own state in Texas. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5172.48s)]
*  So if if someone listening comes to the Texas leadership pipeline, what kind of what kind of support do you offer? [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5180.48s)]
*  We will have hands on experience because we know, like, especially in the beginning, you have to understand at least the bare bones and the structure of what it means to run for office. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5189.48s)]
*  So running one on one story of self one on one finance one on one field one on one and having that personal touch with our our scouts who are doing this year round work under not only our Texas leadership pipeline umbrella, but we are the affiliate for the tax for the national pipeline fund. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5198.48s)]
*  So we actually do also have not only our resources, but resources that we're able to to share and like push people into other areas of the state. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5214.48s)]
*  And opportunities, if it makes sense. Like, for example, we did a training with we did a training with Latino Victory Fund and we connected them with like a broader umbrella of organizations that could help. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5223.48s)]
*  If you're a Latino running for office, the same thing. We're working on something that's LGBTQ focused. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5234.48s)]
*  We're working on tracks of like, what does it mean to be a pro immigrant candidate in Texas? [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5239.48s)]
*  So there's innovative ways that, of course, we have more that one on one connection through our larger pipeline and our entity, but we also have our larger network of organizations that we want to make sure we're connecting people to so they can find their track and their people when they're running for office. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5245.48s)]
*  So I'll ask my political hack question, which is this is a big, big cycle coming up in Texas. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5261.48s)]
*  We've got a Senate race that's that's on the map. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5270.48s)]
*  We Greg Abbott just announced that they're going to try to push for redistricting ahead of the midterms to try to squeeze out a few more gerrymandered seats for Republicans in Texas. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5274.48s)]
*  Obviously, you guys are dealing with tragedy right now with the floods. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5285.48s)]
*  There was text over the last couple cycles has gone back and forth from, you know, kind of the last couple of years. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5289.48s)]
*  There was text over the last couple cycles has gone back and forth from, you know, coming really close to flipping blue to then, you know, some of the folks along the Rio Grande Valley, you know, voting for Trump. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5295.48s)]
*  And so what is the what does it look like on the ground right now? [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5306.48s)]
*  What are you hearing and seeing and and what hopes do you have for for twenty twenty six? [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5309.48s)]
*  What I'm seeing is which is well one to talk about redistricting. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5315.48s)]
*  This is a very much like a Bobby Hill. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5319.48s)]
*  That's not my purse moment. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5321.48s)]
*  Like, that's not your purse Greg Abbott. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5323.48s)]
*  Like, Jesus Christ, like, what are we doing? [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5325.48s)]
*  Well, I know what we're doing. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5328.48s)]
*  We're trying to steal races from black and brown Congress people and constituents. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5329.48s)]
*  But that's besides that point. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5333.48s)]
*  What I am seeing is, though, people who are unwilling to give up. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5335.48s)]
*  And I think we have been having actually multiple conversations about this today. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5339.48s)]
*  I, you know, even myself in a staff position and capacity, I've had to respond to one too many, one too many crises, one too many natural disasters. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5344.48s)]
*  But I tell myself all we have to lose is more lives. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5354.48s)]
*  So there is something that pushes us. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5359.48s)]
*  We have so much at stake. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5362.48s)]
*  And working in Texas is, of course, turning Texas blue is critical. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5364.48s)]
*  It's it changes the union. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5369.48s)]
*  It changes the world. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5371.48s)]
*  But it also changes lives that I get to see every day. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5372.48s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5375.48s)]
*  Working along and being in community with our brothers and sisters in the Valley or what's happening not only in Kerrville, but in surrounding counties. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5376.48s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5384.48s)]
*  Those mass disasters don't have to be making us strong again. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5385.48s)]
*  Like, they could instead not happen because they're preventable. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5391.48s)]
*  And some of the things that we're seeing on the ground, like we're having communications and conversations with folks who are wanting to talk about being a candidate around natural disasters and like environmental justice, the cancer corridor. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5395.48s)]
*  We are mapping around and looking at candidates who are surrounding ICE detention facilities or ISEs that work with ICE. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5408.48s)]
*  Like, there are ways to push back because you have community members who are impacted by this daily and they know what it means if it can. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5415.48s)]
*  It can and it doesn't have to. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5423.48s)]
*  But if it continues. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5425.48s)]
*  So I'm sensing that people are ready to fight and they're very much interested in what a Texas could look like that really reflects the home that I love. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5427.48s)]
*  And that's not reflected in the Greg Abbott or the Dan Patrick or the, you know, whatever Paxton is right now. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5436.48s)]
*  Like in my lifetime, but I also think that you have this window, in my opinion, coming up in Texas. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5442.48s)]
*  And I say this like I will never tell I will never sell the Texas dream, but I will sell the Texas program. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5450.48s)]
*  We can move Texas in those 10 counties, but we have to invest in that leadership year round. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5456.48s)]
*  Right. Having those year round conversations, having year round training, having year round platforms where we can continue to talk to people. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5463.48s)]
*  Because whoever is going to win this state may not even be in electoral politics right now. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5470.48s)]
*  And we got to get them that hand up because I wholeheartedly believe in my lifetime because I'm I'm 36 and I have to believe this because there's there's little left in Texas, but hope and dreams. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5476.48s)]
*  But I have to believe that I'll work for like a U.S. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5487.48s)]
*  Senator from Texas, you know, as a Democrat at some point, because I see the people on the ground actually moving and shaking and working. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5491.48s)]
*  Even though we are sometimes, yes, the beginning of democracy, and I don't want to see Texas be the end of democracy. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5499.48s)]
*  Like there's so much that can happen for new four or five new congressional seats, hopefully in the other direction, more electoral college votes, because we have some of the fastest growing populations in the country. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5506.48s)]
*  But what it will take is making sure that those people who have the opportunity are invested in really. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5518.48s)]
*  And we can do that by investing in the people power of Texas. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5525.48s)]
*  Well, I believe that you will work for a Democratic senator in Texas one day. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5528.48s)]
*  And I also know that whoever that senator is, they will be extremely lucky to have you working for them. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5533.48s)]
*  And we are extremely lucky that you are doing the work you're doing in Texas. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5539.48s)]
*  And we're so very excited that you guys are partnering with Vote Save America and anyone who is listening, who's from Texas, who lives in Texas, who knows people in Texas or North Carolina or Arizona, the other two states that we're doing this in. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5543.48s)]
*  Please think about running for office, because if you do and you're in Texas, you have wonderful people like Anna who will help you out, which which we love. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5556.48s)]
*  And already, you know, this has just been a week. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5565.48s)]
*  We have been like bowled over by the number of you listening who have reached out and decided to sign up and say that you want to run for office. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5567.48s)]
*  We just we just never expected the response that we that we got. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5576.48s)]
*  We know it would be good because we love you guys, but we were just we were overwhelmed by the response. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5579.48s)]
*  So that's good news. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWjdrlt-ws&t=5583.48s)]
