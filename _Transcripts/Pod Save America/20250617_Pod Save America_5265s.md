Video Description: Trump's long-planned birthday parade gets overshadowed by massive "No Kings" protests around the country and the cold-blooded murder of a prominent Minnesota lawmaker and her husband. Meanwhile, Israel launches a preemptive war against Iran—a war that Trump hasn't quite ruled out joining. Jon, Lovett, and Tommy discuss the weekend's competing optics, the deeply troubling rise of political violence in America, and the latest offering from the Trump family hucksters: a shiny gold smartphone from the newly founded Trump Mobile. Then, Jon talks with Maryland Governor Wes Moore about his political future, why he vetoed a reparations bill, and the role that governors can play in this dangerous moment.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Trump and MAGA Hit NEW LOW with Disgusting Reaction to Tragedy
**Pod Save America:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k)
*  That's why you got to condemn violence and extrajudicial violence where and political violence wherever it happens whoever commits it [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=0.0s)]
*  whoever it's against and doing so does not like [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  stop that violence from happening [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  but not doing so creates an environment where [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  It starts to be a little more likely and maybe someone else thinks it's okay and who's who's not doing well [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=16.64s)]
*  And it's just that's you just you've got to condemn it when it happens and and [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=21.6s)]
*  Politicians and leaders in both parties needs to do that a little gun control would be good, too. Yeah [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=25.740000000000002s)]
*  Welcome to positive America. I'm John Favreau. I'm John love it and Tommy Vitor on today's show [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=30.0s)]
*  We'll talk about the deranged right-wing reaction to the political assassinations in Minnesota [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=34.0s)]
*  The gigantic no king's protests and trump's not so gigantic military parade [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=38.8s)]
*  The president directing ice to focus their raids on blue cities and the latest grift from the first family [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=44.08s)]
*  A shitty gold phone that's probably made in china [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=49.44s)]
*  Uh, then later you'll hear my interview with maryland governor westmore about his reaction to the latest news the democratic party's future and his own [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=52.8s)]
*  But let's start with israel's pre-emptive war against iran a war that bb netanyahu very much wants america to join [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=60.4s)]
*  And trump says quote it's possible that we get more involved [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=67.28s)]
*  Israel's surprise attack has not only targeted iran's nuclear infrastructure, but the regime itself [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=70.72s)]
*  Missile and drone attacks have so far left more than 200 iranians dead including at least nine nuclear scientists [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=76.0s)]
*  The chief of staff of iran's military and the head of the islamic revolutionary guard corps iranian retaliatory strikes have so far killed more [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=81.84s)]
*  Than 20 israelis the u.s military has participated in trying to shoot down iranian missiles [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=88.8s)]
*  And we're moving a second carrier group to the area, but that's all we know so far about our involvement [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=94.24s)]
*  It's also been reported that trump refused to give israel permission to assassinate iran's supreme leader over the weekend [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  Uh nuclear talks between iran and the u.s were called off on sunday [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=106.56s)]
*  Can't imagine why but uh iran is now reportedly signaling through intermediaries that it wants to ramp down the conflict and resume [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=109.92s)]
*  negotiations with the u.s [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=117.52s)]
*  If the u.s will agree to stay out of the conflict, uh, and that's the major fault line here you have some [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=119.52s)]
*  Krusty newt gingrich bush era neocon types saying we need to push for regime change [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=124.96s)]
*  While the isolationist magga crowd says we should stay the hell away from yet another war in the middle east [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=130.24s)]
*  Uh trump took a question about this at the g7 in canada on monday. Here's what he said [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=137.2s)]
*  What have you heard? What have you heard from the iranians? They'd like to talk but they should have done that [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=141.28s)]
*  Before I had 60 days and they had 60 days and on the 61st day. I said we don't have a deal [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  they have to make a deal and [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=153.84s)]
*  It's painful for both parties, but i'd say iran is [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=156.48s)]
*  Not winning this war [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=159.76s)]
*  And they should talk and they should talk immediately before it's too late a new war on trump's watch [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=161.67999999999998s)]
*  Uh, I thought I thought we were supposed to have no more wars [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=167.44s)]
*  uh, well, yeah, they never would have happened if he was president when it comes to october 7th or [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=170.32s)]
*  Uh the russian invasion of ukraine. Yeah, and now I guess uh iran and israel tommy [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=174.64s)]
*  Can you walk us through the intra-maga debate on this? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=179.52s)]
*  So you you got it right there the crusty neocons [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=182.32s)]
*  Uh john bolton trump's former national security advisor is one of them fox news guys like mark 11 a radio host [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=185.84s)]
*  They want the u.s. To get directly involved in offensive military operations [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=192.0s)]
*  I say offensive military options because we're helping with defense or shooting down missiles [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  Um, and the reason that's important though is because most of the um, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=200.24s)]
*  Most important iranian nuclear infrastructure is buried deep underground or to the side of a mountain [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=205.52s)]
*  And the conventional wisdom is that to take out that infrastructure like at fordo you need a weapon called the mop [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=211.12s)]
*  the massive ordnance penetrator [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=218.08s)]
*  Uh, this like 30 000 pound bomb that only u.s [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=220.0s)]
*  Planes can carry because it's so big with the b2 self-bomber is the only thing we can [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=223.68s)]
*  That can drop it like the israeli air forces mostly fighter jets [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=227.6s)]
*  so that's why those uh neocons want the u.s to get involved the uh, the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=230.88s)]
*  The folks they're fighting against are like tucker carlson steve bannon marjorie taylor green who I think on the merits friends [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=237.28s)]
*  I mean on the merits and on the politics like i'm team [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=243.36s)]
*  tucker [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=247.28s)]
*  mtg here fellas like so on the merits [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=249.04s)]
*  I think they have correctly identified [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=252.64s)]
*  And they did so before this week that this wasn't really just about weapons of mass destruction [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=254.88s)]
*  This was a regime change war which has been confirmed by all these reports that trump is vetoing plans to kill the iranian supreme leader [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=259.68s)]
*  So check for tucker there and then the politics [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=266.48s)]
*  I just think that like tucker and bannon and mtg are way more in tune [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=270.0s)]
*  With the maga base than like the gang at national review and no one wants [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=273.68s)]
*  Another war in the middle east and no one is going to believe another [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=278.64s)]
*  Intelligence based trust me we're the experts pitch about why we need to go [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=282.78000000000003s)]
*  Decapitate the leaders of another middle eastern country. Yeah, there's like reports today that trump has been sending signals [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=289.34000000000003s)]
*  To the to get to the iranians that hey as long as you do not [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=296.88s)]
*  Harm us service members. We are not going to get more involved [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=301.36s)]
*  Doesn't mean to kind of getting that to iran to keep them from bombing u.s bases or to go after u.s ships [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=304.47999999999996s)]
*  Uh, it seems like trump does gets the politics of not wanting to be dragged [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=309.44s)]
*  into this but it's also you know, it's first of all, it's it's not clear that he's [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=314.32s)]
*  It's not clear it's not clear what they're what they're posturing versus what they're actually planning to do [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=320.64s)]
*  Uh versus what he's saying in hindsight to justify what israel did after the discussions last week [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=325.76s)]
*  It's just like very hard to understand what's really going on [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=330.47999999999996s)]
*  I feel like we have uh, you know [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=333.52000000000004s)]
*  This started saying okay the the iranians were so so close to getting a nuclear weapon [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=335.92s)]
*  It could have been any day. So really this is a preemptive strike to protect israel from them getting a nuclear weapons [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=341.36s)]
*  Then it was like well, maybe they're maybe they're like a couple months away [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=346.48s)]
*  But you know, they had they were got to get nuclear weapons [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=349.36s)]
*  So whatever and now netanyahu said in an interview with john carl on monday that killing the supreme leader would quote end the conflict [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=351.52000000000004s)]
*  not escalate it [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=359.28000000000003s)]
*  Is regime change now like an acceptable justification for preemptive war? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=361.44s)]
*  Because I thought like we we this like international community international law get the united nations and I I wasn't aware that [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=366.08s)]
*  If you think a regime [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=373.2s)]
*  May get nuclear weapons at some point you can actually eliminate the entire regime. You just go bomb them [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=375.11999999999995s)]
*  I will say also the the timeline [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=379.84s)]
*  Uh for how quickly iran could get a nuclear weapon has been kind of jumping around [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=382.4s)]
*  And when it comes out in nyo's mouth [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=386.72s)]
*  I mean the the trump administration's timeline as articulated by tulsi gabbard was that it would take a year for ron to get a nuclear weapon [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=388.24s)]
*  There's a bunch of different phases of this [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=395.28000000000003s)]
*  There's the enrichment phase where you have to enrich enough uranium to get it to weapons grade and then you weaponize it [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=396.48s)]
*  And then you need a delivery mechanism [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=402.0s)]
*  So it's a little bit technical and wonky but uh, I don't think this was like a this weekend problem [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=403.36s)]
*  You know what I mean? Yeah, it's it's yes the the like how close they are to it versus [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=408.40000000000003s)]
*  What is the actual rationale for doing this when netanyahu says? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=414.08s)]
*  Often their goal is to talk while continuing to develop their program no matter what so is this because they were [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=418.56s)]
*  Imminently on the break of getting a nuclear weapon or is it because they saw an opportunity [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=424.32s)]
*  To degrade iran's capability and took it and are using ad hoc justifications [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=429.12s)]
*  after the fact, yeah, but to your point, I mean like [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=435.28s)]
*  Like the idea that killing the supreme leader changes everything or like fixes the problem is crazy [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=437.91999999999996s)]
*  There's not some pro-western [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=442.96s)]
*  pro-israel opposition groups sitting in iran [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=445.12s)]
*  Waiting to march towards tehran and announce their commitment to democracy and pluralism like that's just not what's going to happen here [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=448.4s)]
*  You kill the supreme leader. Guess what happens? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=453.92s)]
*  They replace the supreme leader and that replacement decision is made by a bunch of hardline clerics and irgc [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=456.0s)]
*  And the political elites and you get someone who is basically the same or maybe the irgc [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=462.24s)]
*  Uh stages a coup and they take power and I think [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=467.76s)]
*  Recent history suggests that the guys with the guns end up in charge [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=471.68s)]
*  And so that's why tucker was saying on the show or tucker wrote this like kind of op-ed length [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=476.64000000000004s)]
*  Screed on twitter where he said so why is mark levin once again hyperventilating about weapons of mass destruction to distract you from [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=481.6s)]
*  The real goal which is regime change young americans heading back to the middle east to topple yet another government [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=487.36s)]
*  He also said that a war with iran would amount to a profound betrayal of trump supporters. It would end his presidency [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=492.48s)]
*  I just really think like [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=497.84000000000003s)]
*  Tucker's making some good points here [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=499.28s)]
*  uh, I noticed someone retweeting a video of bp netanyahu in uh, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=501.76s)]
*  2002 telling america quote if you take out saddam, I guarantee you that it will have enormous positive reverberations on the region [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=507.58s)]
*  Do we think that uh a new regime in iran will have enormous? Yeah [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=515.4399999999999s)]
*  Positive reverberations on the region work great in iraq work great in libya. What could possibly go wrong? Yeah, it's really worth [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=519.52s)]
*  Looking up netanyahu's testimony before congress where he was advocating for the invasion of iraq [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=525.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's what that was. Yeah, he could not have been more wrong. What's all what's also just sort of? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=532.48s)]
*  Confusing is okay. The rationale is to [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=537.5s)]
*  Is based around degrading the nuclear capability then why are you going after state television now? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=541.68s)]
*  You can make an argument. I'm sure they would that that's a you know, uh, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=548.08s)]
*  A mouthpiece for a dictatorial murderous terrorist regime, but it's not a means to degrade their nuclear capability [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=551.9200000000001s)]
*  So what is is this going to because the on the other side of it? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=557.6800000000001s)]
*  It's oh this stops the second they stop having a nuclear [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=561.36s)]
*  Program, but that has nothing to do with having a nuclear program [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=564.96s)]
*  I mean is is there an example in the middle east in recent history of a nation where coming from this of of a nation where? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=567.9200000000001s)]
*  Uh, there was an oppressive regime like there is in iran and the regime fell [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=575.76s)]
*  It was either ousted or fell on its own like, you know asad [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=580.08s)]
*  And it was replaced by some stable [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=584.32s)]
*  Government, I mean the only example right now could possibly be syria with the guys who just took over or former isis [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=587.68s)]
*  al-qaeda guys, but you know time a little too early to time will tell but it's really been fascinating not only watching the [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=594.96s)]
*  intramagga debate but also kind of like [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=600.32s)]
*  The attempts by the white house to spin it both ways. Yeah, you know what I mean? Like it was trump sincerely [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=602.56s)]
*  Trying to have steve witkopf do these talks with the iranians and cut a nuclear deal or was this whole thing? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=608.24s)]
*  Uh subterfuge the whole time and it was all in bad faith. Either way if you're iran [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=614.4s)]
*  Like what is going to bring you to the table now? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=619.04s)]
*  Uh that jonah trump was too weak to control netanyahu and prevent him from bombing you [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=621.36s)]
*  Or that he was lying to you all along and the talks were a ruse to somehow facilitate this israeli bombing campaign [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=626.3199999999999s)]
*  And then on trump's domestic politics, right? He wants [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=632.4s)]
*  To be on the side of the tom cottons of the world who are all cheering israel on he wants to be seen as the ally [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=635.44s)]
*  Israel needs to those kind of pro-war pro-israel hawks while at the same time [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=641.52s)]
*  Signaling that he doesn't want to be for more involved that he's not interested in the u.s [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=646.08s)]
*  Becoming kind of an offensive participant in this for the kind of more dovish isolationist parts of his party trump wants to be for what's happening [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=650.88s)]
*  Whatever, you know, he's always like this thing goes south [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=658.5600000000001s)]
*  We're gonna hear from him that he tried to stop this and he told bb [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=661.92s)]
*  That this was a horrible idea and why is netanyahu? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=666.3199999999999s)]
*  He'll turn on bb so fast if this goes south and if it goes well, then it's [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=669.76s)]
*  you know this [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=675.4399999999999s)]
*  He'll probably admit that it was that they lied all along that they didn't really want to deal that [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=677.04s)]
*  This was a whole thing to like get you know, he's just [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=681.6s)]
*  He's just going to be for whatever's popular. That's like that's his whole foreign policy [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=684.4s)]
*  Yeah, I mean trump basically attacked netanyahu after october 7th [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=688.32s)]
*  And like was just talking shit about them in in the like in the immediate wake of this horrific [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=692.32s)]
*  Uh existential attack on israel. He was like, ah, never would have happened [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=699.6s)]
*  He blamed netanyahu for failing to prevent it all things that are true [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=702.96s)]
*  But to your point like he will turn on him in a second if his operation goes south and remember his problem with gaza was not [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=705.84s)]
*  the the fact that [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=711.92s)]
*  Uh, so many civilians were dying. It's that like it's too public [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=713.52s)]

*  You would look [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1054.24s)]
*  Getting shot [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1056.72s)]
*  You would think would would trigger in him [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1058.16s)]
*  Like a modicum of empathy when he hears about an incident like this and he would just maybe lob in a call to tim walls [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1061.52s)]
*  And or the families of the victims and just say something decent [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1067.8400000000001s)]
*  But instead he was asked if he was going to call tim walls and he was like, nope [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1071.1200000000001s)]
*  He's a terrible governor incompetent person because maybe i'll call him, you know, it's like nothing has changed in this man [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1074.4s)]
*  and the the the [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1079.68s)]
*  conspiracy theory stuff from mike lee and the worst people on twitter it just [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1081.74s)]
*  It like makes you completely hopeless about the information environment on social media in the wake of any tragedy any real problem [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1085.8400000000001s)]
*  Like any crisis. Yeah, it was just cooked. It also used to be that when they throw conspiracies [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1093.28s)]
*  They were we were pretty sure that they were wrong that we were they were wrong, right? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1098.96s)]
*  But there was like, you know [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1103.28s)]
*  Maybe a two percent chance that someone could possibly believe the conspiracy was right [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1105.28s)]
*  This is so dumb the shit that they were putting out there. It doesn't make sense. Oh [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1110.4s)]
*  They tim walls ordered an assassination because this person voted against tim walls on [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1114.96s)]
*  You know making sure that undocumented immigrants do not get medicaid, right? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1123.1200000000001s)]
*  That was that's the theory and then the list is out and it's like, oh, yeah [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1126.88s)]
*  Keith ellison the attorney general and also tim walls and a u.s senator and a bunch of other [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1130.72s)]
*  Democratic politicians in other states were also on the list like had nothing to do with that vote [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1136.6200000000001s)]
*  So that doesn't match up at all. See but none of this stuff changes the conspiracy [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1141.68s)]
*  They just they just to your point about the k-mil they just go forward [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1145.6000000000001s)]
*  Well that all the facts are showing like definitively definitively that they're wrong and they just keep going [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1148.96s)]
*  Well, so mike lee posts something more sensible on his official account, but this post stays up [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1154.96s)]
*  I think he pinned it for a while even after it was like he doesn't delete it [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1159.04s)]
*  He doesn't apologize doesn't take it back amy clobeshaar who is friends with melissa hortman told msnbc [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1161.76s)]
*  That she was going to confront mike lee directly about it. And I hope she does [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1168.0800000000002s)]
*  Because because like she should you know, it's all fun and games on the internet people should make floor speeches [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1171.92s)]
*  Uh, they just go down to the senate floor and and and yell at mike lee [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1177.6000000000001s)]
*  I think they already I think they already have started doing that great [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1181.28s)]
*  Uh, but but like mike lee should be confronted by a person to a person like these were real people, right? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1183.68s)]
*  You're just making something up feeding this sort of toxic political environment [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1188.96s)]
*  And you know amy clobeshaar you work with her you see her every day. She knew this person [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1193.04s)]
*  These were real people gunned down by somebody [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1196.4s)]
*  Uh, but yeah, it's uh, no i'm for these people have to [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1198.88s)]
*  Defend their bullshit like live and in person on tele like you hide behind your twitter account [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1203.5s)]
*  And you send out your bullshit tweets and then you just like slink away as everyone starts believing it like no [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1210.24s)]
*  You need to defend this in front of an audience [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1214.8s)]
*  It's all yeah, it's just [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1217.68s)]
*  The trump assassination attempt the arson attack on josh shapiro the shooting at the dc jewish museum the fire bombing of people in colorado [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1219.2s)]
*  January 6 gabby gifford steve scolese like there's just a lot of this and there is [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1227.94s)]
*  So little to protect politicians. I mean like president gets secret service [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1233.6200000000001s)]
*  But like mitt romney remember that exit interview he did he talked about one of the reasons he was quitting politics [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1237.46s)]
*  Was he was worried about attacks from? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1242.26s)]
*  I mean, I think he specifically named like trump super fans on him or his family and he talked about [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1245.38s)]
*  The massive cost of security and like he's a rich guy. He can afford it [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1250.66s)]
*  But like a state representative in minnesota, they've got no resources. Well, there's no way to protect yourself. You're not doing this job [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1254.34s)]
*  like you don't you're not gonna be able to protect yourself and also [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1260.4199999999998s)]
*  What upside is there for people to get into politics? [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1263.54s)]
*  Minnesota state rep is getting targeted. That's that's what really worries me. I mean the the times [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1266.6599999999999s)]
*  Did a story on just you know elected officials all across the country being very scared [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1271.6999999999998s)]
*  Uh about this based on this episode of political violence and all the other ones that you just mentioned [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1276.98s)]
*  And you know one ohio state senator posted on facebook, honestly, i'm struggling with this news i'm worried for my family [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1281.94s)]
*  I worry i'm putting them in harm's way by being in office. It's a terrible feeling like that's just that is [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1288.02s)]
*  Yeah, it's awful the [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1293.94s)]
*  part of this too is so in [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1296.42s)]
*  In the sort of whatever the uncovered list that this person had [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1299.7s)]
*  There's also a bunch of like people finder websites for finding people's home addresses [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1303.94s)]
*  um, and you know we [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1309.46s)]
*  For a long time we just there was just an assumption that the [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1313.22s)]
*  Homes of the addresses of public officials would one way or another be public whether it's on a filing document or their voter registration [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1315.78s)]
*  Or simply just through um the fact that so much of this information is already public [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1322.1s)]
*  But like that isn't like we do not have to accept that like yeah, it's hard to put the toothpaste back in the tube [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1326.6599999999999s)]
*  But we should have privacy laws that protect [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1331.3s)]
*  Addresses for people that's a small step that is hard to make work [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1334.58s)]
*  But it could at least help over the long runs to kind of make it possible to get this information [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1337.86s)]
*  Off of the internet we need a national privacy law [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1343.2199999999998s)]
*  That feels like a hard thing to do but like we have to make it harder for this kind of homes [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1345.78s)]
*  Like where people live needs to be harder [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1350.74s)]
*  To get at and that's just like making people now part of the problem there, right? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1353.2199999999998s)]
*  Is like there's some amount of public accountability for where people live, right? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1357.3s)]
*  They have to live in the district. It matters if you know when uh, uh, what's his name when dr [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1360.02s)]
*  Oz was campaigning and it was like what's his actual address this big home? [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1365.22s)]
*  Is it that big home like it's a part of politics? [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1368.18s)]
*  but like there's just like compromises that need to happen there the other part of this too is [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1369.94s)]
*  you know, we as you were saying this john that like we [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1375.14s)]
*  You know, you kind of in this bleak moment. It's a cycle. All right. What were the motivations? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1378.18s)]
*  Were they good? Were they were the ones we were they on our side or their side, right? [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1382.18s)]
*  and it's like we don't step back and look at [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1385.38s)]
*  the kind of [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1388.26s)]
*  Underlying conditions that would lead somebody regardless of their ideology [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1389.54s)]
*  The ideology is just a it's just an ultimately a rationale for whatever kind of active kind of political [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1392.58s)]
*  violence which is rooted in whatever feeling of powerlessness a desire to kind of get revenge whatever it may be and [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1398.4199999999998s)]
*  Like social media is a part of that right? [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1405.46s)]
*  Like we see growing support polling wise for political violence polling wise for just uh, the justification for assassinations [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1407.54s)]
*  Justifications for the killing of the ceo of uh united health care [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1415.22s)]
*  I was out there over the weekend a lot of people with very ironic luigi signs, right and like [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1419.06s)]
*  The that all contributes to [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1425.3799999999999s)]
*  A sense that we live in a violent society where violence [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1429.06s)]
*  Is part of politics where the other side may use it [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1433.78s)]
*  So you should use it before they do and in sort of a broad way, right? [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1436.4199999999998s)]
*  It leads people to feel both powerless and radicalized but also in acute ways, right? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1439.86s)]
*  Well, these these people that pop up like they are being radicalized in acute ways by these same [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1444.82s)]
*  Kinds of mechanisms and I just like we need to be honest about that. We need to think about that [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1449.7s)]
*  We need to figure out ways for for for leaders [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1453.78s)]
*  To kind of attack that culturally and also like the underlying problem of what happens to people when they radicalize online [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1458.02s)]
*  Yeah, and that's why you that's why you got to condemn [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1464.42s)]
*  Violence and extrajudicial violence where and political violence wherever it happens whoever commits it whoever it's against [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1467.6200000000001s)]
*  and doing so does not like [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1474.82s)]
*  Stop that violence from happening but not doing so creates an environment where [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1477.06s)]
*  It starts to be a little more likely and maybe someone else thinks it's okay [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1482.66s)]
*  And who's who's not doing well and it's just that's you you just you've got to condemn it when it happens and [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1485.94s)]
*  Politicians and leaders in both parties needs to do that a little gun control would be good too [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1491.7s)]
*  Yeah, a little more gun control. Yeah, the other the other thing too [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1495.38s)]
*  That was like there's a political scientist who's an expert in political violence talked about this in the times about how actually what? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1497.7s)]
*  Might be most useful is for democrats and republicans to make statements together [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1503.54s)]
*  But one big fucking problem is that donald trump just pardoned all the insurrectionists and sent a signal that there's a certain kind [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1506.8999999999999s)]
*  Of political violence that he's a huge huge fan of right and is one of the biggest [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1512.34s)]
*  Stokers of political violence in our country and are constantly calling his enemies vermin and all the rest and so like the [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1516.26s)]
*  the kind of it's just uh [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1521.86s)]
*  When trump was shot literally everyone condemned it every single democrat every republican former presidents [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1524.02s)]
*  Like you know, it was like it was everywhere everyone did and in this case like we can't get trump to say yeah [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1530.82s)]
*  I'm gonna call tim walsh [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1536.1s)]
*  I'm gonna wish him well, like it's [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1538.1s)]
*  It's completely yeah [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1540.34s)]
*  Uh the news about the shootings broke on the day of the no kings protests which continued as planned [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1542.66s)]
*  Even in minnesota where governor walsh tried to warn people away from participating because of the no kings flyers found in the killer's car [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1547.78s)]
*  um across the country an estimated [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1554.42s)]
*  5 million people showed up which makes it one of the single largest protests in american history [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1556.42s)]
*  Overwhelmingly peaceful very few arrests the protests were planned to coincide with trump's military parade in washington dc [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1561.52s)]
*  Which turned out to be uh fairly subdued and sparsely attended [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1567.78s)]
*  One guy in attendance told the guardian he thought trump was politicizing the army and that the parade was quote just kind of lame [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1571.94s)]

*  Uh, we were in front of city hall and at first it didn't seem like it was just sort of gathered right on the steps of [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1625.1399999999999s)]
*  City hall, but then as we were there more and more people started coming and there were these sort of [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1631.62s)]
*  Add like these sort of marches coming from all directions kind of filling [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1635.62s)]
*  The park and then we kind of followed that and first of all, it was just [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1639.22s)]
*  It was interesting right because you saw like what looked like [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1643.54s)]
*  What I would say is sort of like a a women's march adjacent group of people, right? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1646.82s)]
*  There was a lot of there was a kind of like the no kings kind of resistance [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1650.58s)]

*  Anti-ice pro-immigrant protests that have been part of downtown been sort of showing up at downtown for the last couple of [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1658.98s)]
*  Of days and it all kind of blended together into what I would look to me as like the most diverse protest [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1666.26s)]
*  I've ever spent two in los angeles, uh, or ever and [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1671.54s)]
*  We we walked down just sort of seeing where all the different protests were going and we ended up [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1675.86s)]
*  wandering down to the federal building where a lot of the kind of confrontations and sort of the sort of more kind of [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1679.78s)]
*  the vandalism has happened some of the violence and kind of back and forth with the police have happened and [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1685.06s)]
*  We went to the federal building and there were the marines standing in front of the federal building just fucking standing there [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1689.06s)]
*  There was there was a police officer with them [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1694.6599999999999s)]
*  And so when somebody would kind of walk to kind of press the line a little the cop would talk to them [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1696.4199999999998s)]
*  The marines really didn't at least that I saw [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1700.34s)]
*  But uh, you know some people were shouting [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1702.8999999999999s)]
*  Uh at the marines angrily some people kind of more forlornly being like you shouldn't be here, right? [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1705.6999999999998s)]
*  You saw like everything there. Um, but what I felt seeing them the marines god like in the same way like [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1710.8999999999999s)]
*  trump forcing like [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1718.1799999999998s)]
*  The military kind of march in front of him on his birthday [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1720.02s)]
*  Sending these fucking guys to a federal building and you're like, why are they guarding the federal building to protect them from the protesters? [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1722.5800000000002s)]
*  Why are the protesters there to be because they're angry about the marines? [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1728.42s)]
*  Yeah, and it's just like you felt I just felt bad for them. Yeah, like I I just felt yeah, exactly [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1731.46s)]
*  I just felt bad for them like the whole thing like felt combustible like you just felt like oh [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1736.18s)]
*  This is where later this is where it's going to happen because as as all these protesters that came for the main event start [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1740.74s)]
*  leaving that will just be left behind some of the more kind of [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1746.3400000000001s)]
*  Uh, uh, like the people that have been kind of fucking throwing shit and making kind of uh trouble over the last couple days [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1748.9s)]
*  and sure enough that is what happens and [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1755.38s)]
*  And that that happened as the night wore on but like for the most part [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1757.38s)]
*  It was incredibly moving and inspiring to be down there [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1760.98s)]
*  I will just say to huge credit to our friends at indivisible [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1763.38s)]
*  And other groups who organize these protests that is I mean that is a very tough thing to organize and to pull off well [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1767.46s)]
*  and um from what I saw at our protest there was also like [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1774.26s)]
*  A discipline involved, you know, the first speaker was like it's going to be peaceful [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1778.5s)]
*  Um, we want to make sure that everyone can speak who's speaking also like turn to someone next to you who you don't know [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1783.06s)]
*  Shake their hand. I didn't like that part [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1789.14s)]
*  Of course don't touch me sweaty sweaty person [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1791.86s)]
*  Um, but I had I had a couple some people go to we gotta be [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1794.9s)]
*  I did have a couple of friends ask me like what so what's the point of these protests like trump's [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1799.54s)]
*  You can't beat trump again. He's already president. It's year one [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1804.98s)]
*  but I and I get that but I think like [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1808.3400000000001s)]
*  building this capacity [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1811.22s)]
*  and sort of exercising the muscle right now of you know on a [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1812.98s)]
*  On a beautiful day in in june getting five million people out in the country to protest donald trump is going to be important [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1817.6200000000001s)]
*  um in the coming years, especially if you know trump continues to push us away from democracy and towards [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1824.8200000000002s)]
*  Authoritarianism because you're going to want to have this capacity and I think it is also very valuable for people to [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1831.04s)]
*  Get out of their fucking houses and offline and actually see people in in real life who are also feeling the same way you do about things [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1837.38s)]
*  Yeah, definitely also be nice to the uh, poor military guys who are deployed in california [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1845.38s)]
*  I know I really especially the active duty guys the marines like I bet they were like what 18 to 20 [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1850.18s)]
*  They look so young active duty guys are so young when you see them in person like the the national guard [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1854.42s)]
*  You tend to be older. They're like people with other jobs are in their 30s. They're from california [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1860.1s)]
*  But they're not happy either. None of them want to be on those streets [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1864.74s)]
*  It sucks for them just as much as for us like having them here in our in our city [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1867.54s)]
*  And it just felt you just feel how unnecessary it all was just like just they are there because donald trump doesn't give a fuck [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1872.18s)]
*  About them. They are a prop [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1878.02s)]
*  Uh to create the illusion of whatever and uh, that just sort of made me feel really sad about the whole situation [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1880.26s)]
*  But also like you know what like yeah millions of people are showing up and it is raising the it raises the price [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1886.82s)]

*  Like all these people showing up it raises the price on on whether they try to do mass deportations [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=1899.14s)]

*  Speaking of the military, uh, what'd you guys think of the uh, the parade in dc the uh, the army turned 250 and uh, [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2042.02s)]
*  Donald trump decided to co-opt their birthday for his own [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2049.3s)]
*  He got himself a little parade. I did not like watch any of it unfold live [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2053.06s)]
*  I saw clips on twitter, but what did you guys think? Yeah, I didn't watch one [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2057.78s)]
*  Second of it and yeah clips I saw [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2061.62s)]
*  I mean obviously they were mostly clipped by people with partisan political agendas, right as as happens on twitter [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2063.8599999999997s)]
*  I don't know. It made me wonder if we all hyperventilated about it a little too much, uh, and whether the [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2071.3799999999997s)]
*  Lead up was a little silly and made everyone involved look silly and it was just a stupid parade [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2076.8199999999997s)]
*  there was a waste of time and money and [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2081.14s)]
*  Yeah, whatnot. But yeah, I had the same feeling I couldn't tell [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2083.46s)]
*  john, I talked about this on youtube a little bit too, but like that that [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2086.98s)]
*  like [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2090.8999999999996s)]
*  When I actually saw it, I was like, oh my god, like, you know [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2092.1s)]
*  America doesn't do authoritarian [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2096.1s)]
*  North korea style military parades and so even when trump tries to do one it ends up just looking like veterans day [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2098.5s)]
*  You know and like they're you know, just they're people in a park some people I think because they're trump supporters some people because [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2103.46s)]
*  There's just a thing happening. Uh, it all looked very sort of [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2108.74s)]
*  Unthreatening in the end [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2113.7599999999998s)]
*  Um, maybe that's also in part because the military does not want to participate in an authoritarian display of military power on behalf of our [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2115.14s)]
*  autocrat [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2121.6s)]
*  Uh, so you end up seeing guys with fives fives you end up seeing guys with fives and the tricorner hats hard to get mad [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2122.42s)]
*  About that hard to be sad when you see those guys [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2128.5s)]
*  I always thought it was a a wasteful dumb thing to do and also that uh, you know [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2131.2999999999997s)]
*  The idea here is to fulfill trump's clearly authoritarian intentions whether it was an actual threat [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2136.5s)]
*  it it [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2142.5s)]
*  The threat seemed lessened by the fact that the week prior there were actual federal troops [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2143.86s)]
*  Federalized national guardsmen and marines on the ground here in la [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2149.36s)]
*  Because of protest so that seemed like much more of a threat than the parade [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2153.46s)]
*  Yeah, I see and to be honest sort of stole the spotlight from well parade being threatening the la [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2156.34s)]
*  Deployment and us kind of like living in that kind of upped my anxiety about the military parade [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2161.28s)]
*  Which ultimately it would I agree with you was the reverse. Yeah, it was just like who cares [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2166.26s)]
*  Yeah, and I think the I think the five million people peacefully protesting also helped too like that was an outlet for people's anxiety [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2170.98s)]
*  Over the parade and the fact that they smartly did not hold one in dc [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2178.42s)]
*  Which I think was you know, I didn't totally get that and I once I saw how it all unfolded [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2182.34s)]
*  It was really really smart every it took the microphone from him [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2186.6600000000003s)]
*  And by the way, just a lesson of protests over the last decade [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2189.38s)]
*  We were now at the 10-year mark of fucking trump coming down the escalator [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2191.78s)]
*  protests take the microphone away from donald trump like [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2194.9s)]
*  His parade was not the big story the protests were a much bigger story because it was more interesting exciting and newsworthy [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2197.7s)]
*  Uh, what except on fox news? [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2203.14s)]
*  To the protests any time their three-hour broadcast the protests they weren't talking they weren't talking about iran and israel most most of that time [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2205.54s)]
*  They weren't talking about the political assassinations in minnesota [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2212.66s)]
*  It was just like the most important thing in the world right now is this fucking parade the treads on that tank [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2215.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it was all that kind of crap. It's so wild ridiculous. They're embarrassing. Um [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2220.5s)]
*  One of the big issues that brought people out to protest is trump's mass deportations, which have become very unpopular very quickly [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2224.82s)]
*  Late last week trump even acknowledged that his immigration raids were hurting farmers in the hospitality industry [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2231.6200000000003s)]
*  And the administration issued new guidance to ice telling them to pause raids and arrests in the agricultural hotel and restaurant industries [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2237.38s)]
*  But then on sunday trump made it clear that his deportation policy isn't really about targeting criminals and protecting farmers and hospitality workers [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2246.0200000000004s)]
*  It's about targeting immigrants in blue states and protecting them in red states. He directed ice via truth social to quote [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2254.42s)]
*  Expand efforts to detain and deport illegal aliens in america's largest cities such as los angeles chicago and new york [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2261.5400000000004s)]
*  Because quote these and other such cities are the core of the democrat power center where sanctuary cities play such a big role [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2268.7400000000002s)]
*  You don't hear about sanctuary cities in our heartland [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2276.26s)]
*  At the g7 on monday trump responded to a reporter's question about his post [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2279.46s)]
*  You did a post last night where you said you want ice to really target democrats [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2283.2200000000003s)]
*  I want them to focus on the cities because the cities are where you really have what's called sanctuary cities [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2286.9s)]
*  And that's where the people are. I look at new york. I look at chicago. Look at la la those people weren't from [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2292.1800000000003s)]
*  La they weren't from california most of those people all blue cities [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2298.7400000000002s)]
*  All democrat run cities and they think they're going to use them to vote. It's not going to happen [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2303.14s)]
*  I mean it's been reported that trump only changed his mind on the farm workers after [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2308.7400000000002s)]
*  Um lobbying by his agriculture secretary [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2313.7000000000003s)]
*  Who's getting help from some of the big farmers and producers? [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2317.3s)]
*  Many of whom in red states also business owners. What do you guys make of the trumps? What do you make of trumps back and forth on this? [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2320.82s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it feels like it's um [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2328.1800000000003s)]
*  Policy in progress, you know, I'd like farm farms construction sites [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2331.0600000000004s)]
*  Uh restaurants meat packing plants. They will all shut down if I deport every undocumented person who works there [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2335.1400000000003s)]
*  um, and so i'm sure he's getting calls from [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2342.1000000000004s)]
*  CEOs and business interests and business lobbying groups to tell them that much and tell them to dial it down a little bit [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2344.8s)]
*  It's but on the political front [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2350.1000000000004s)]
*  We've been saying this all for the past week like trump wants a fight with liberal cities [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2352.5s)]
*  They think it's good politics. His staff is giddy when he started to fight with california or gavin newson. They run to the [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2357.46s)]
*  Uh, you know dc tip sheets to tell them how great it's going for them [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2363.22s)]
*  And then the poland comes out and it shows the opposite [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2367.06s)]
*  But I did find like what was remarkable about that true social statement [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2369.06s)]
*  Was trump not kind of like dropping the pretext that it was about safety and security and just saying that democrats quote use illegal aliens [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2372.4199999999996s)]
*  Who expand their voter base cheat in elections and grow the welfare state while real americans are cheering ice on like that [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2378.3399999999997s)]
*  That's just not a compelling [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2384.4199999999996s)]
*  Rationale, I think for most people to explain an ice raid. It's also undocumented immigrants. Don't vote [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2386.1s)]
*  How many times are we fucking gonna do this again like this whole theory the whole replacement theory is so ridiculous [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2392.58s)]
*  They don't vote and by the way trump won [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2399.54s)]
*  naturalized immigrants in the last election [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2402.96s)]
*  so stupid the the like [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2405.7s)]
*  Saying that he's not going to go after farm workers or hospitality workers [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2409.2999999999997s)]
*  Those are two of the three big categories tommy mentioned the third construction. It's interesting. It hasn't mentioned that yet [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2412.5s)]
*  I'm sure people will his fucking real estate [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2416.4199999999996s)]
*  Developer buddies will get him on the phone and the next thing you'll know say we're not going to go after we need the construction workers [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2418.98s)]
*  because by the way, there are already shortages of construction workers, but [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2423.3s)]
*  this whole like [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2427.3s)]
*  It's like what does trump want he wants? [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2429.38s)]
*  to declare victory he wants images of of [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2431.94s)]
*  Mass deportations, but he doesn't want the mass deportations to the mass deportations to impact the economy [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2435.54s)]
*  So it's like almost what he wants is deportations without deportees, right? [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2442.5s)]
*  He wants to be claimed to be successfully doing the thing of of of of of kind of this kind of campaign against immigrants [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2446.02s)]
*  But then he doesn't want the economic consequences. So [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2453.86s)]
*  California, uh, we're a so-called sanctuary state [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2456.72s)]
*  The population of undocumented immigrants in california has been going down. It has gone down [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2460.02s)]
*  It went down for by a hundred thousand from 2019 to 2022 texas passes a law banning sanctuary cities in 2017 [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2465.38s)]
*  Undocumented immigrants living and working texas goes up florida passes a law in 2019 [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2471.52s)]
*  In the three years since passing that law florida's population of undocumented immigrants goes up by 400 000 [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2476.18s)]
*  Why it is not because of the politics it is despite the politics because people go to where they can afford to work and to live [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2482.42s)]
*  California is too fucking expensive. So for the same reason that florida and texas brags about their economy all the time [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2489.92s)]
*  They are drawing all these undocumented immigrants. And so what has happened? [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2495.06s)]
*  uh, they have created a situation where the most hostile places actually have [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2498.02s)]
*  A a growing economy built on the backs of a growing population of undocumented [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2502.5s)]
*  Labor and so then you have now trump saying i'm going to go after what the blue cities [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2507.62s)]
*  That's where the immigrants are. It's just it's just not true, right? [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2512.5s)]
*  There's no there are no sanctuary cities in florida. There are no sanctuary cities in texas [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2516.18s)]
*  The the politics of the cruelty of of what they're doing to immigrants or immigrants feeling less safe in those places has had no impact [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2520.42s)]
*  On this right because this is an economic problem [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2527.38s)]
*  It is not a a kind of you can try to enforce your way out of it without hurting the economy is just not possible [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2529.9399999999996s)]
*  I mean so trump acknowledges that [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2535.54s)]
*  These undocumented immigrants are vital to our economy and he thinks that they should be protected [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2537.7799999999997s)]
*  And he also just wants to make sure that people who are here illegally who've committed crimes get deported [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2542.8199999999997s)]
*  So one idea for him is the people who are here who are undocumented [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2549.22s)]
*  perhaps [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2554.56s)]
*  uh, if they're working [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2555.7s)]
*  We can give them some kind of a like a path where they can then be become fully citizens and then folks who commit crimes [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2557.7799999999997s)]
*  We can deport them back and then we can have a a sort of tough security at the border to make sure we don't have [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2565.62s)]
*  More illegal crossings. That's one idea now the reason that we don't have that is because steven miller [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2570.58s)]
*  Who's actually running most of trump's policy is telling him that they're all criminals and because steven miller actually wants [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2576.5s)]
*  Every undocumented immigrant and most documented immigrants out of the country and he's been very clear on that [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2583.46s)]
*  He doesn't want legal immigration. They just added another they're thinking of adding another 36 countries to the travel ban list [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2589.46s)]
*  Used to been used to be muslim majority countries now. It's just you know, a lot of countries in africa people of color, right? [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2595.54s)]
*  steven miller just doesn't he just doesn't want immigrants here because he hates immigrants because he's hated immigrants since he was in fucking high school [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2601.46s)]
*  In santa monica and he would you know shout racial slurs at them [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2606.42s)]
*  So like that's the kind of dynamic here and trump's looking at himself like I want the good ones and I don't want the bad ones [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2609.54s)]
*  And he's just too stupid to realize what the fucking difference is [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2614.82s)]
*  Well, he's even said that he's even said some version of like they should be able to stay there should be some sort of a [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2617.06s)]
*  Way for them to stay describing comprehensive immigration [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2620.74s)]
*  Reform, but then you know steven miller then says go to home depot. They start going to the home depots [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2624.18s)]
*  What does that do that terrifies people to go to work? [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2628.5s)]
*  It makes it so that people don't show up to do their jobs because they're afraid and it shuts down construction [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2631.3s)]
*  It shuts down businesses politically. He should just take the win like you shut down the border [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2636.02s)]
*  Go to the border once a week and brag about it in states where the local law enforcement will work with ice [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2640.98s)]
*  Deport people who are arrested deport actual criminals in the sanctuary cities where they won't work with you [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2647.62s)]
*  Let the governor deal with it [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2653.06s)]

*  So this whole idea that they're going after the worst of the worst and you know [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2687.7s)]
*  Dhs put out another statement this morning saying we're only going after the worst for the worst [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2692.2599999999998s)]
*  We know exactly who we're going after [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2696.9s)]
*  That's not true because the wall street journal reported last week that miller said [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2698.5s)]
*  We don't you don't have to have lists of people that are you're targeting anymore [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2702.58s)]

*  That's it and then they start signaling a homeowner signaling. They said oh, don't worry. We're gonna go after the employers next [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2707.86s)]

*  Pick up the deportations or the self deportations and then you say well, okay [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2716.5s)]
*  You're going after employers, but the president just said to leave [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2720.18s)]
*  Agriculture alone and the president just said to leave hotels and restaurants alone [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2723.92s)]

*  Because it's all just being made up. They're making it up as they go. Yeah. Yeah [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2739.06s)]
*  Um, all right before we get to my interview with westmore [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2742.42s)]
*  I do want to touch on an exciting new product launch from our friends in trump world [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2744.5s)]
*  On monday eric trump announced that his family is getting into the mobile phone business [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2749.46s)]
*  Uh, that's right for just five hundred dollars. You'll be able to get yourself a shiny gold t1 phone from trump mobile [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2754.66s)]
*  and for a monthly fee of just [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2761.22s)]
*  4745 you can sign up for the 47 plan that includes unlimited talk text data and so much more [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2763.92s)]
*  Uh tech journalists are pointing out that the america first phone looks an awful lot like a model already made by the chinese company wing tech [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2770.5s)]
*  and available on t-mobile [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2776.9s)]
*  But it is gold it is gold [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2778.98s)]
*  A reporter at 404 media tried to pre-order the t1 smartphone and said the website failed went to an error page [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2781.46s)]
*  And charged in the wrong amount for the down payment [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2787.3s)]
*  Were were you guys able to put in your pre-orders yet? That's so funny charging in the wrong amount of such a nice little chef [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2790.5s)]
*  These things are so stupid. First of all, there's not going to be a real trump cell phone network [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2796.26s)]
*  It's a virtual mobile network. Remember remember, um patriot mobile [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2801.54s)]
*  They were selling like anti-woke cell service and then when you really dig into the details [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2806.02s)]
*  They just buy like they license in bulk access to at&t t-mobile all the so-called woke providers that you're [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2810.02s)]
*  They're railing against in their ad so you're just getting played and then there's just literally no way the trump team [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2817.38s)]
*  Can build these phones in the u.s [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2823.46s)]
*  Unless this rollout is like five years too early [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2825.3s)]
*  Like there's just no infrastructure to build a smartphone in the united states right now [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2827.1400000000003s)]
*  And so if you look at the website it says trump mobile its products and services are not designed developed manufactured distributed [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2831.06s)]
*  Or sold by the trump organization or any of their respective affiliates or principles [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2836.74s)]
*  So they're clearly just like licensing out some chinese phone and then pretending they have their own network [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2840.2599999999998s)]
*  And then in practice trump is now like a fake telecom phone operator [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2846.8999999999996s)]
*  But also oversees the fcc, which is which is no longer independent also [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2850.9799999999996s)]
*  The colon normal he's he's he's taken away the independence of the fcc [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2854.58s)]
*  He's got a trump stooge in charge of it and now he's he's in the mobile phone business [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2859.3s)]
*  I just [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2865.06s)]
*  Yeah, like I I saw the announcement [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2866.1000000000004s)]
*  I did not think he was building a 5g network of his own [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2867.86s)]
*  And I did not think he was making a phone in the united states because nobody does that we don't we don't do that [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2870.5s)]
*  Um, so it's like yeah, okay [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2874.6600000000003s)]
*  So he's doing like a kind of whatever he's not building a 5g network of his own because rfk jr [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2875.78s)]
*  Is like don't do that. That's a good point. Yeah [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2880.26s)]
*  You know, yeah makes it makes you gay makes the frogs gay 5g makes the frogs gay, but the uh [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2884.5s)]
*  But uh [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2892.5s)]
*  Yeah, but the like what are you guys doing? You guys you're gonna you're buying [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2893.46s)]
*  Maybe they're assembling them or doing something to make it made in america or assembled in america at some point [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2898.82s)]
*  Which I don't even think they figured this part of it out yet [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2903.38s)]
*  It doesn't totally seem like by the way everyone's like, oh, this is definitely the phone [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2905.3s)]
*  Are you sure that's the phone or did somebody grab a picture of a phone off the internet? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2908.1800000000003s)]
*  And put a fucking gold thing on it and they have no idea what the phone's gonna be yet [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2912.7400000000002s)]
*  Uh, so like this whole thing is so stupid. I don't even understand who this grift is for [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2916.58s)]
*  It's more expensive than some of the cheaper [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2920.34s)]
*  Uh, like similar kind of fake phone brands [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2922.34s)]
*  So it's like so this is for like some small subset of trump super fans like I think it's like licensing too [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2924.1800000000003s)]
*  Because I I read that they're working with some of the carriers [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2930.02s)]
*  So it's not like they're inventing their own verizon or t-mobile [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2932.98s)]
*  They're like working with some of these companies to license the mobile carrier [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2935.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's just a white label on a just another service [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2939.46s)]
*  It's just ridiculous and I just don't know like I I just truly like I don't know like i'm a pretty big barack [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2942.1800000000003s)]
*  Obama fan, but I wouldn't buy a phone from the guy. Uh, remember the obama phones. Remember that? [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2947.06s)]
*  This is now this is now a real [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2951.94s)]
*  Those are allegedly given out free to people [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2955.38s)]
*  Yeah, the whole grift is I think they partner with some idiotic provider someone who's gonna like buy these phones in bulk [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2957.54s)]
*  They slap their name on it and they take like a 20% rip on whatever the sales are right? [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2964.02s)]
*  That's right. There is a company that says they can do this, right? [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2968.34s)]
*  There's a company that says they can do that that company pays a fee to them [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2970.7400000000002s)]
*  That company charges something on top of what it costs to get the service [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2973.94s)]
*  And then trump and the family charges a service on top of that [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2977.3s)]
*  and so whatever the delta is between the cost of like whatever t-mobile or [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=2980.1800000000003s)]

*  Uh, I saw that instead of attending you went for a run with service members at fort mead [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3274.1s)]
*  Having served in the military yourself. How'd you feel watching? [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3280.02s)]

*  You know, uh and it looked like not many people watch it there in person either [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3293.94s)]
*  Um, you know, but but it's it's it is one of these things where uh, you know [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3298.1800000000003s)]
*  I have a deep love for the united states army because this is an organization that really helped to save my life [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3302.42s)]
*  Um, you know, I joined the army when I was 17 years old. Um, [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3308.7400000000002s)]
*  I joined the army. I wasn't young enough to I wasn't old enough to sign the paperwork [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3312.34s)]
*  My mom signed the paperwork for me, but this was an organization that didn't just uh change the trajectory of my life [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3315.46s)]
*  I I think everything I learned everything that I that I gained from serving in the military [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3321.46s)]
*  Um have been things that I still use to this day [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3326.7400000000002s)]
*  These are these are my brothers and sisters for life the people who I serve within afghanistan [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3329.54s)]
*  Um, and and so I took the 250th as something that was very deeply personal [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3333.54s)]
*  Where it's a you know the fact that we could be out there and enjoy the freedoms we enjoy [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3338.6600000000003s)]
*  Someone had to fight for those right someone had to protect those freedoms [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3344.1800000000003s)]
*  And oftentimes it was the people who were wearing our the uniforms that I wore the uniforms of the people [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3348.1800000000003s)]
*  Uh, you know who we who we celebrate war and also as a celebration of those who died in those uniforms [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3353.78s)]
*  Um, and so I I just thought that there was a much better way [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3360.02s)]
*  For us to be able to remember the importance of the united states army [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3363.94s)]
*  There was a much better way for us to be able to remember the importance of those [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3367.3s)]
*  Those men and women who raise their hands to serve in an organization that has helped to make this country as strong as it is [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3370.7400000000002s)]
*  There's a much better way to remember those and frankly, um when you were watching an administration who's doing things like cutting [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3376.5s)]
*  The the the budget for the department of veterans affairs cutting benefits for veterans [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3382.98s)]
*  Um that is firing federal workers at just this uh, this this breakneck speed [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3388.18s)]
*  Regardless of the fact that one in three federal workers are military veterans themselves [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3393.3799999999997s)]
*  But then you think that a celebration of the army is throwing a parade on your birthday [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3398.02s)]
*  Um, I I just I just find it to be uh, you know, just just uh deeply tone deaf [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3401.8599999999997s)]
*  Uh, and and frankly deeply offensive [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3407.22s)]
*  Yeah, I was saying to a friend earlier that I sort of felt for the troops watching the parade and I wonder having [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3409.62s)]
*  You know served yourself and you know received the training you did [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3418.2599999999998s)]
*  You know not asking you to put yourself in the in the minds of every um service member, but [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3422.66s)]
*  How do you think it feels in the uh armed services right now? [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3428.02s)]
*  You have you know federal troops in the streets of la [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3432.58s)]
*  Uh or federalized guard you have marines, uh here as well [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3436.42s)]
*  There was that speech at fort brag [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3440.9s)]
*  Uh the other week where trump, uh, they screened [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3443.0600000000004s)]
*  Uh participants for loyalty to trump and you had some service members behind him who were more pro trump and they were [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3446.7200000000003s)]
*  booing names of democratic officials when trump was attacking them and cheering when he was making fun of others [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3453.38s)]
*  How do you think it feels to be? [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3459.3s)]
*  Serving in the military right now considering the political backdrop [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3461.78s)]
*  It's sad and I do feel for them. I I think you uh, I think your description is right that I um [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3465.94s)]
*  I just feel horrible for them because that's not why we signed up [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3471.94s)]
*  Uh, you know, I I had the honor of serving with some of the most amazing men and women [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3475.3s)]
*  Uh that i've ever met and and I and there was one question. I never asked a single one of them [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3479.78s)]
*  What's your political party? [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3486.1000000000004s)]
*  I never asked one of them how they voted in the last election. I never asked one of them [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3488.1000000000004s)]
*  You know what your voter registration is never [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3492.42s)]
*  Um the the men and women who I led the men and women who I served with [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3495.62s)]
*  Uh, the the only thing that we had in our minds was our ability to take care of each other [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3500.5s)]
*  And to do everything in our power to make sure that we were bringing the other one home [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3505.54s)]
*  Uh, you know that no matter what that we would do everything in our power to make sure that you got back home to your family [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3509.06s)]
*  and um [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3514.9s)]
*  and and I and I think about just how [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3516.02s)]
*  different [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3518.98s)]
*  An experience this is for these men and women who are who are serving in some cases again [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3520.26s)]
*  You know members of the 82nd airborne division that was that was that was my unit in afghanistan [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3525.2200000000003s)]
*  And it's just kind of unimaginable to think that that's something that uh that they're being asked [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3530.6600000000003s)]
*  Uh now about their political loyalties whether or not they're going to get a chance to be seen on television or not [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3535.78s)]
*  Uh, I just think that the the work is too serious for that [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3540.82s)]
*  Um, the consequences are too dire [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3545.2200000000003s)]
*  For that and these are people who have put their hands on a bible and pledged allegiance [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3547.62s)]
*  Um not to an individual [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3554.18s)]
*  Now, I never took a pledge. I never took an oath to the president of the united states [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3556.66s)]
*  My oath was to the constitution [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3560.4199999999996s)]
*  Right. My oath was to the values my oath was to was was to protect this country to fight and win our nation's war [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3562.2599999999998s)]
*  To protect our country against all enemies foreign and domestic that was the oath that I took it was never to an individual [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3569.14s)]
*  No matter who the commander in chief was at that time and um, and I just think it's really important that the way we honor [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3574.8199999999997s)]
*  the the the service of these individuals who are part of the less than one percent to have raised their hand [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3581.3799999999997s)]
*  Of this country to be able to protect it and defend it and to give their lives if necessary [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3588.18s)]
*  The way you honor their service is by respecting the oath that they took [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3592.1s)]
*  And I just felt like that was a uh, what and the things that we've seen it wasn't just one incident [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3597.2999999999997s)]
*  It's just now kind of repeated a series of incidents, uh, just seemed to be a real deviation of of the oath that we all took [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3602.02s)]
*  So, uh also this weekend, uh, it seems like an estimated five million or so people came out to protest donald trump [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3609.2200000000003s)]
*  Um, one of the single largest protests in american history. I've had a couple people ask me [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3616.02s)]
*  What's the actual goal of these protests and where do they go from here? [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3620.98s)]
*  Uh, what do you think? [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3625.0600000000004s)]
*  You know, I I respect people's people's first amendment rights. Um, [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3626.9s)]
*  And and I think that we have we all have a right to to the freedom of assembly of of a freedom of speech [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3631.54s)]
*  And I think that that people should pay attention that there is a very real frustration [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3637.7799999999997s)]
*  um to [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3642.58s)]
*  To what's happening with this in administration and it's not the really interesting about the protest is it's not a frustration to an individual incident [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3644.02s)]
*  Right. It's not a frustration saying oh, it's the policy around [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3651.7s)]
*  immigration [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3656.16s)]
*  Or oh, this is a policy around the potential cuts to medicaid or oh [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3657.22s)]
*  This is a protest to the way that we are that we are firing federal workers because the motivations for [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3661.9399999999996s)]
*  So many people who are out there marching is varied and it's different but it's all tied up [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3668.58s)]
*  in one theme [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3674.2599999999998s)]
*  And that is this idea that no one is above the law and everyone has an obligation to defend it protect it and follow it [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3676.3399999999997s)]
*  That's the whole idea of no kings [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3685.62s)]
*  Right, and so so that's the thing that I think is is really is really powerful in some ways about the protest is is [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3687.94s)]
*  There's is not a single political issue [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3694.74s)]
*  That got people out there [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3697.22s)]
*  Uh, but it is just on this idea that that that we believe that the president of state should actually follow the law [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3698.8199999999997s)]
*  And we believe that the people [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3705.22s)]
*  Collectively that our voice is much bigger and much stronger than just an individual or even a individual political party [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3707.22s)]
*  That's involved because I think even out there you didn't just see democrats, right? There were democrats independents republicans, you know agnostics [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3715.3799999999997s)]
*  Out there, but they're all protesting the idea of protecting a value [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3722.5s)]
*  And something that we as we as as americans take very seriously and very personally [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3726.8999999999996s)]
*  And so I think the thing that we've got to remember in all this though [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3731.2999999999997s)]
*  And the question of where do we take it from here? [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3734.4199999999996s)]
*  We have to remember that that this energy and this push is not about a singular day [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3737.06s)]
*  It's we have to keep the intensity up [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3744.26s)]
*  And we also have to remember that that the results that people are hoping for and hoping to see in their own lives [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3747.38s)]
*  That that's something that we're not willing to compromise on either like how we're going to be remembered in this moment [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3753.06s)]
*  Ten years from now is not how loud we yelled [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3758.02s)]
*  Right. It's not how many how many people showed up to [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3761.06s)]
*  Our protest it was the fact that were we able to deliver [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3764.18s)]
*  On the hopes that people actually have for what their government can provide [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3768.42s)]
*  And I think if we do that then we can turn this thing from just a uh from a from a moment to a much larger [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3772.74s)]
*  To a much larger movement [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3778.66s)]
*  So i'm sure you were horrified by the news of the political assassinations in minnesota over the weekend [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3780.5s)]
*  I didn't think it could get any worse until I saw the reaction from prominent right-wing figures [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3787.22s)]
*  Who spread obviously false conspiracies about the shooter's politics u.s senator mike lee said this is what happens when marxists don't get their way [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3791.3s)]
*  Senator bernie moreno elon musk both said it shows how the left has become violent [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3799.7s)]
*  Trump influencers like mike chernovich and alex jones even suggested that tim waltz was behind the assassination [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3804.5s)]
*  um [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3810.1s)]
*  You had tweeted how you know saddened you were by it and you also said that we need a renewed commitment to civil discourse [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3810.98s)]
*  How how do we even begin to do that when [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3818.58s)]
*  That's the reaction from some of the most influential people in the republican party [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3822.98s)]
*  It's tough [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3827.3s)]
*  It's tough when um [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3829.46s)]
*  When something so horrific [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3831.54s)]
*  uh happens [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3833.78s)]
*  uh to two people and and frankly I I um, I don't care [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3835.1400000000003s)]
*  What your political affiliation is? [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3840.7400000000002s)]
*  I don't care if you agree or disagree [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3843.2200000000003s)]
*  um when you have [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3845.6200000000003s)]
*  Two public servants who were who were taken out? [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3847.86s)]
*  um [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3851.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean literally uh targeted assassinations and then targeted assassination attempts [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3853.06s)]
*  um [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3858.34s)]
*  for uh, you know because of a political ideology [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3859.38s)]
*  uh, I I you know you you cannot tell me that that um that [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3862.82s)]
*  the [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3867.7000000000003s)]
*  Attempts that we saw we've seen that we saw on on on franklin president trump [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3868.6600000000003s)]
*  That that should break your heart any more or any less? [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3873.6200000000003s)]
*  Than what we saw in in minnesota and I think it says a whole lot about people who uh who think that [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3876.8199999999997s)]
*  That uh that somehow that uh that politics was behind one and the danger of this political violence [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3883.46s)]
*  Uh is is more dangerous than one than the other, you know [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3890.66s)]
*  We have to remember that um that in this time it is important for us to be able to [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3894.1s)]
*  um both turn down [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3899.62s)]
*  the [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3902.02s)]
*  the language and the rhetoric [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3902.8199999999997s)]
*  Um and to know that you know that that being a public servant should not mean risking your life [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3904.58s)]
*  And we've passed legislation here in the state of maryland. Um, that's focused on things like protecting our judges [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3909.94s)]
*  And protecting our election workers because we've had election workers attacked. We've had we had a judge [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3915.46s)]
*  uh [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3921.38s)]
*  Recently in the state of maryland, uh in western maryland, uh assassinated killed in killed in front of his own home [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3922.66s)]
*  So we've been very clear that this level of political violence and political vitriol [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3928.98s)]
*  Is is not just dangerous. It must be stopped [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3933.96s)]
*  But but but but we have to be able to have the courage to be able to call it out [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3936.04s)]
*  No matter what it looks like and no matter who's doing it. Is it something you've worried about? [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3941.72s)]
*  For your for yourself your own family. I mean listen, I I think it's something that for each and every one of us [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3947.4s)]
*  We worry about I I uh, I unfortunately, um, you know, I I get [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3952.2799999999997s)]
*  uh [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3957.16s)]
*  FBI and intelligence reports every single week [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3958.04s)]
*  Um, I know how the level of threats [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3960.92s)]
*  um [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3963.72s)]
*  Have increased since since i've been the governor [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3964.6s)]
*  Right as the first black governor in the history of the state of maryland is only the third african-american [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3967.56s)]
*  ever elected, uh [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3972.52s)]
*  as a governor in this country's history, you know, I uh, I I I have um, i've seen the data [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3974.2s)]
*  About the increase in in threats that have come [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3980.6s)]
*  I also know this [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3984.44s)]
*  Uh that the thing we're asking of our public servants [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3986.04s)]
*  And the the and the promise we make to our public servants is for people who are willing to raise their hands [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3989.64s)]
*  For people who are willing to serve something bigger than themselves for people who are willing to [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=3996.12s)]
*  Go into this work understanding the difficulties [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4001.56s)]
*  That it presents to you and your family members at least that we can do [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4005.0s)]
*  Is to make sure that you can feel safe [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4009.32s)]
*  In your own home in your own communities in your own skin [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4011.6400000000003s)]
*  That's your families can feel safe and that it's not just the obligation frankly of of law enforcement [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4015.7200000000003s)]
*  To be able to provide that for us. It's up to the citizens whether they are supporters of us or not [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4021.96s)]
*  To be able to say that we can [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4028.76s)]
*  Even if we disagree with what a person is saying it should never get to a point that we are then um [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4031.7200000000003s)]
*  Threatening them or their families or their family safety. Yeah [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4038.04s)]
*  Uh, so we still have american troops deployed here in los angeles, uh, and trump just directed ice to expand operations [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4041.96s)]
*  in blue state cities [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4049.4s)]
*  How are you planning to handle? [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4051.32s)]
*  a potential a potential expansion of immigration raids in a city like baltimore or even a deployment of [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4053.7200000000003s)]
*  Troops in your state or or trump trying to federalize the maryland national guard [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4061.6400000000003s)]
*  There was a washington post story last week that said trump wants the national guard to play a bigger role in immigration enforcement going forward [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4066.92s)]
*  Yeah, you know I as as as both the the commander in chief of maryland's national guard and as someone who's worn the uniform [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4073.96s)]
*  Uh, you know truthfully I I take I take that role very seriously. Uh, in fact just this past weekend [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4081.1600000000003s)]
*  I was with the members of our national guard as we as uh as we were as they were training up, um to be able to [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4086.84s)]
*  Uh help protect our our citizens if uh, if if uh, if we call that orders for them to do so [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4093.56s)]
*  And i'm a big believer that the people on the ground have the best understanding about what's happening [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4099.88s)]
*  There's a reason that we have an escalation of of uh, you know of resources that we can deploy that I know how many local [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4105.08s)]
*  Uh law enforcement officers we have I know how many state law enforcement officers have I know [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4113.08s)]
*  What we have in terms of our in terms of our our national guard [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4117.24s)]
*  Um, and so that's why I think for the people on the ground [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4120.84s)]
*  We have the best understanding of what's needed and what's required in situations to make sure that our people are safe [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4123.88s)]
*  Which for me is the number one priority to make sure that my people in the people in my state are safe [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4129.24s)]
*  And I take that responsibility very seriously, but when it comes to immigration, I also know that this is a very personal issue [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4134.599999999999s)]
*  Um, you know, I was raised by an immigrant single mom and our immigration system is functionally broken [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4141.96s)]
*  And there's one group who can solve it and that's congress [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4149.72s)]
*  And the truth is the president of the united states could fix the immigration problem right now if he chose to [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4153.32s)]
*  He could just simply go to the speaker of the house and say I need a comprehensive immigration bill on my desk next week [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4158.28s)]
*  And it would be on his desk next week because he has the votes [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4163.8s)]
*  He has the house. He has the senate. He has the white house and he's not doing it [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4167.0s)]
*  He's just simply choosing to use executive actions many of which illegal [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4171.24s)]
*  To be able to deal with an issue because he has no interest in dealing with the issue [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4175.56s)]
*  And so it is very very frustrating as a state as a as the chief executive of a state and frankly as a commander in chief [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4181.320000000001s)]
*  Of a national guard in the fact that we do have a broken system [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4187.72s)]
*  but [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4192.04s)]
*  The commander in chief of the united states army, uh does not seem to have an interest in actually fixing it [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4193.08s)]
*  Just has an interest in in in weaponizing it [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4199.08s)]
*  Yeah, and not just weaponizing it but it does seem like um his policy is [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4202.2s)]
*  Okay, if you're a farmer [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4207.879999999999s)]
*  Or you're in the hospitality industry and you're in red states or places that voted for me [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4211.24s)]
*  Maybe we can back off on immigration enforcement and we'll just target [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4216.92s)]
*  blue states that's been the case on many of his policies and many of the [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4221.08s)]
*  Institutions he's targeted since becoming president [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4227.139999999999s)]
*  How do you see this as you know a governor of a blue state? [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4230.12s)]
*  In terms of just sort of trump using the office to sort of declare war on blue america. Yeah [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4234.36s)]
*  Um, the the way that I see it is is none of this is terribly shocking [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4241.4s)]
*  Uh, none of this is terribly surprising. Um, you know, I we've been we've been we've been battle boarding [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4245.88s)]
*  Um for this type of scenario for a very long time [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4251.4s)]
*  Uh, so the thing that we do is you know [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4254.919999999999s)]
*  We control the things that we can control and one of the great things about being a governor [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4257.799999999999s)]
*  Honestly, john is that you know, we're able to show what an alternative looks like [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4262.12s)]
*  Where you know, we tell our people where you know, we have a we have a president of the united states who right now is uh [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4265.799999999999s)]
*  Is with his whole doge project [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4271.24s)]
*  um, uh is now actively just firing [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4273.5599999999995s)]
*  federal workers and [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4277.32s)]
*  We have a greater level of exposure in the state of maryland than anyone else because I have over 260 000 federal employees [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4278.839999999999s)]
*  In my state. Um, and while he is arbitrarily firing federal workers [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4284.44s)]
*  We're spending our time making sure that our federal workers are supported by actually streamlining them into available state and private sector jobs [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4289.4s)]
*  Uh and making sure that if I have a person who is qualified and interested [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4296.759999999999s)]
*  I want to get them as quickly as possible get them in classrooms, right? [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4301.0s)]
*  Get them in hospitals get them in places where we have a shortage to know that their skills are necessary and know that we have a society [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4304.919999999999s)]
*  Uh that uh that is going to benefit from their continued service when we have a president of the united states [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4311.96s)]
*  Who is who is spending their time? [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4317.160000000001s)]
*  you know being able to use a budget to [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4319.240000000001s)]
*  To be able to shrink the economy [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4322.200000000001s)]
*  We saw a contraction of the u.s economy in the first quarter for the first time that we've seen in years [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4324.280000000001s)]
*  And in our state we've actually gone from 43rd in the country in unemployment to now being amongst the lowest amongst the lowest unemployment [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4329.4800000000005s)]
*  rates in the entire country [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4335.88s)]
*  By being able to focus on things like apprenticeship programs by making Maryland the first state in the country [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4337.32s)]
*  To have a service year option for all of our high school graduates by doing the largest mass pardon in the history of the united states of america [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4342.92s)]
*  And getting people back into the workforce particularly people who've been excluded for the workforce for things like a misdemeanor cannabis conviction from the 1980s [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4349.16s)]
*  And so I think the thing that we've really focused on in our state [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4356.84s)]
*  Is that this this this this binary this us versus them? [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4360.599999999999s)]
*  This this you know that that the only way that I can win is if you lose [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4364.92s)]
*  That we're just showing in the state of Maryland that we think differently [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4369.16s)]
*  That we actually think that part of the goal is that we can build a society where as I learned in the military when I was [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4372.44s)]
*  17 years old where we leave no one behind [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4377.96s)]
*  And that is the kind of society that shows that we don't have to just fall in line [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4380.92s)]
*  With what the president of the united states is doing that we can actually provide an alternative and I think the people of our state are [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4386.2s)]
*  Are responding well to it when governor newsom spoke about the raise and the troop deployment last week. He said quote [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4392.759999999999s)]
*  Uh democracy is under assault right before our eyes [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4399.5599999999995s)]
*  This moment we have feared has arrived trump is taking a wrecking ball to our founding father's historic project [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4402.759999999999s)]
*  Uh, do you agree with all that are you at the same level of alarm? [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4409.32s)]
*  Well, I I think you can't look at what's happening right now and think that this is normal [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4413.719999999999s)]
*  Uh, these are very abnormal times [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4419.48s)]
*  And these are times when we're watching just uh, not just a an overreach of executive authority [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4422.759999999999s)]
*  But in many ways an illegal reach of executive authority [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4428.28s)]
*  Um, the the thing I would also say, um about that though is this is i'm also very honest about our country's history [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4431.879999999999s)]
*  um [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4440.44s)]
*  I'm also very honest about about our founding fathers and what their intent was [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4441.32s)]
*  Uh, and i'm not sure if I was part of their full intent when our founding fathers first put together [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4446.2s)]
*  First put together the documents of this country and first put together the foundation of this country. I think this country is a constant evolution [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4451.32s)]
*  Um, I think this country has had a uh, a deeply uneven history [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4458.52s)]
*  But that's actually the thing that also gives me hope [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4463.64s)]
*  Um is that I I don't I I don't uh, you know, I I don't uh, you know sit there and and uh, and [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4466.52s)]
*  Act like the country's history doesn't exist. I think the country's history is real and it matters and this country has had a very brutal history [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4473.16s)]
*  um [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4479.32s)]
*  for a lot of groups [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4480.4400000000005s)]
*  I also know that the reason that I can stand here as the governor of Maryland [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4481.96s)]
*  Is because there were Marylanders like harry atubman [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4487.64s)]
*  And Marylanders like Frederick douglas and Marylanders like thurgood marshall who when they saw [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4491.24s)]
*  This type of breakage when they saw this type of unevenness when they saw these type of illegal activities taking place that they fought [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4497.96s)]
*  And they're willing to fight for they didn't know me by name, but they fought for the hope of me [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4505.56s)]
*  And that's the responsibility that I very much take on [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4510.84s)]
*  Right now is that um is that you know, this country has seen [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4514.12s)]
*  Uh, this country has seen these type of behaviors before [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4517.88s)]
*  Um, this country this country has had these type of behaviors as part of its core foundation [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4521.320000000001s)]
*  before but I think understanding that history is also the thing that gives me a a real sense of a real sense of [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4526.360000000001s)]
*  Of realism and frankly hope [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4534.04s)]
*  That that that joy does come in the morning, but you got to fight for it [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4537.24s)]
*  And that's exactly what uh what we've chosen to do here in Maryland [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4541.4s)]
*  Speaking of our country's history [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4544.84s)]
*  Back in may you vetoed legislation that would have created a commission to study the issue of reparations for slavery in Maryland [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4546.5199999999995s)]
*  Um, your basic reasoning has been [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4552.5199999999995s)]
*  We don't need another study [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4555.0s)]
*  Um, and you know, it's time to focus on the work itself of tackling racial disparities [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4556.5199999999995s)]
*  Uh, obviously, you know, you've got some heat for that [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4561.32s)]
*  Studies aside though. Do you believe reparations are justified? [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4564.04s)]
*  Yeah, you know when I when I looked at the the bill, um, and the length the language of the bill [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4568.52s)]
*  literally lays out that we're going to do uh, do do this do the uh, [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4573.96s)]
*  This study this commission, um, and then in two years they bring the recommendation to the governor [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4578.84s)]
*  My point is this I am the governor [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4584.28s)]
*  I don't need two years [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4586.84s)]
*  Let's get to work [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4588.28s)]
*  And I think about the work that we have done in the state of Maryland [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4589.719999999999s)]
*  No state has been as aggressive in these past two years on on this work of repair that we've seen in the state of Maryland [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4592.5199999999995s)]
*  That in the past two years, you know, we've invested over 1.3 billion dollars going towards our hbcus [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4598.44s)]
*  Which is a 60 increase than we saw from our predecessor and we've gotten it done in two years that we have created over [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4604.28s)]
*  1600 new black homeowners in the state of Maryland by making sure we're prioritizing [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4611.3s)]
*  Investments to first-time home buyers that we have been able to invest over 800 million dollars going towards black-owned businesses [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4615.74s)]
*  Uh, and by being able to do things from procurement reform [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4623.1s)]
*  Expungement reform sign the largest mass pardon in the history of the united states of america [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4627.0s)]
*  There is nobody who is questioning my commitment to this work or my commitment to the work of repair [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4631.82s)]
*  But what I am saying is this is that there's been a whole series of scholarship [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4636.78s)]
*  On this issue [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4641.9800000000005s)]
*  There's been a whole series of of report [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4643.1s)]
*  There have been you know, four others in just the past 25 years in Maryland that have been along these lines, right? [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4645.34s)]
*  Um, and my only point is this is is this is the time and i'm and i'm excited to do that work with [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4651.58s)]
*  The members of our general assembly with the members of the black caucus [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4657.820000000001s)]
*  Uh who have done really good work on this and a lot of stuff we've done together and this is the time for continued action [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4660.7s)]
*  That that I am, uh, I'm I'm I'm I don't need two years [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4666.7s)]
*  I'm ready to go right now [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4670.7s)]
*  And that's the focus that I want to be able to take because the truth is is that I know how much time I have left [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4672.139999999999s)]
*  Um, in fact, you know a clock sits on my desk [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4677.5s)]
*  Um that I now have uh have 500, uh 500 believe now in 21 days left in my first term [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4680.86s)]
*  I'm not wasting one of them [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4686.86s)]
*  Uh, and i'm ready to be able to continue the work of repair that our state needs [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4688.139999999999s)]
*  Because the truth is is that the history of racism is littered throughout every single aspect of the state of america [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4693.42s)]
*  And people know this [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4700.54s)]
*  It's time for us to be able to do action on it [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4703.339999999999s)]
*  It also sounds like you believe that the work of reparations [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4705.98s)]
*  Can more effectively be done [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4711.259999999999s)]
*  Uh with some of the policies and some of the steps you've taken in maryland to help target racial disparities [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4714.219999999999s)]
*  as opposed to um [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4721.58s)]
*  Reparations which is a politically loaded controversial word that may not have the political support necessary [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4723.66s)]
*  Uh in comparison to some of the policies that you've taken on in maryland. Is that right? Yeah [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4730.86s)]
*  Well, I mean I think I think [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4735.98s)]
*  Racism is not an act [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4738.2s)]
*  Right because I think I think I think actually lets people off the hook too easy [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4740.86s)]
*  Because I think it's like, you know a person's like well, I don't I don't I don't wear a hood [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4744.7s)]
*  I don't say the n-word so i'm not racist [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4749.0199999999995s)]
*  Racism is not an act [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4752.3s)]
*  Racism is a system [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4754.3s)]
*  Racism is a system that allows an eight to one racial wealth gap in the state of maryland [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4756.78s)]
*  And we have an eight to one racial wealth gap not because one group is working eight times harder [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4761.74s)]
*  Right. It's a system [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4765.42s)]
*  That is put in place that that racism that that it's not an act [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4767.42s)]
*  that that cause [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4772.3s)]
*  historical redlining [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4773.8s)]
*  It's not an act that cause unfair appraisal values in historically redlined neighborhoods [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4775.88s)]
*  It's not an act that cause business creation to be so dispersed and to be so divided [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4781.72s)]
*  It's not an act that cause access to capital to be so limited particularly in black communities that this is a system [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4788.2s)]
*  That has created that and so I believe deeply [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4795.4800000000005s)]
*  Deeply that the work of repair is about repairing systems [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4799.16s)]
*  Because you could you could have a conversation about about how are we addressing individual acts? [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4804.76s)]
*  All you want if the if the people still exist in a system [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4811.4s)]
*  That doesn't work if people still exist in a system that is broken if people still exist in a system that allows children [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4815.64s)]
*  Not to get the education that they need for for for racism to show itself in the air that people are breathing [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4822.44s)]
*  In the water that people are drinking in the homes that people are living in in the way that they are policed and the [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4827.72s)]
*  Transportation assets they have and do not have then then then then then the work of repair is not going to be done by addressing an act [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4832.36s)]
*  The work of repair is only done when you're addressing systems [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4840.44s)]
*  And that's why I think the focus that we've had in the state of maryland over these past two years where we collectively [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4843.96s)]
*  Have moved on these issues faster and more aggressively than anyone else in the country [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4850.5199999999995s)]
*  And I don't think there's anyone who can claim anything different [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4855.719999999999s)]
*  Focusing on this issue of work wages and wealth [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4858.92s)]
*  That I am I'm I'm deeply aware of our history. That's why i'm so aggressive on it [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4862.12s)]
*  But I also know i'm not going to let people off the hook by simply saying we're going to address it by addressing individual acts [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4867.24s)]
*  I am attacking systems because I think that's the only way that we're going to be able to address this in a long-standing fashion [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4873.4s)]
*  So, uh, you've been very clear that you are not currently running for president [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4879.96s)]
*  You've talked about focusing on the urgency of 2025 before we get to 2028 fair enough [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4885.4800000000005s)]
*  Um, your recent travel schedule has also included events in south carolina, pennsylvania, georgia michigan in a few weeks [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4891.4800000000005s)]
*  Fair to assume also that you're at least thinking about it [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4898.28s)]
*  No, i'm not running and not it's not it's not fair to assume because honestly if you if you look at where else [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4902.68s)]
*  So you will not run no, no [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4907.64s)]
*  I'm not no and and here's and here's actually I think the important thing for for people to remember with this [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4910.76s)]
*  Is um is I will go anywhere and everywhere [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4915.88s)]
*  Uh to be able to not just talk about the good things that our state is doing but also make sure that more people [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4919.16s)]
*  Are coming to my state [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4924.5199999999995s)]
*  You know the states that you mentioned are important [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4925.5599999999995s)]
*  But also it doesn't mention the other places that we've also gone that might not be quote-unquote battleground states [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4927.4s)]
*  But you know what I was doing [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4932.5199999999995s)]
*  I was talking businesses to try to get them to come to state of maryland just like I was doing [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4933.4s)]
*  In those states and and and when I say i'm not running and why I feel so confident [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4936.679999999999s)]
*  and very secure in that is i'm also very much a person who I um, [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4941.8s)]
*  uh, you know when I [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4946.679999999999s)]
*  You know, I remember when I have a mentor of mine, um the great elijah cummings [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4948.5199999999995s)]
*  Um, who was a who was a congressman out of baltimore? [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4953.08s)]
*  Um, it was not just a dear friend but a mentor and when he passed away [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4955.639999999999s)]
*  There were a lot of people who came up and said, you know [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4959.08s)]
*  You should really consider running for his seat and it was very humbling to include people who were close to him [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4961.96s)]
*  And it was very humbling. Um, and but I knew in my heart. That's not what I wanted to do [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4967.24s)]
*  So there was nothing that anyone could tell me to make me do it [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4971.88s)]
*  Um, I remember when I was getting ready when I said to myself and I thought I was like I want to run for governor [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4976.2s)]
*  There were a lot of people who tell me I shouldn't run for governor [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4981.96s)]
*  They're like you can't win. I don't know why you're doing this. This is going to end really really badly for you [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4984.4400000000005s)]
*  Um, and I knew there was nothing that anyone could tell me [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4989.56s)]
*  To make me not run [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4993.0s)]
*  So I am I am I am very comfortable [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4995.0s)]
*  With uh and and confident with and thankful for the fact that you know, i'm a kid who literally [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=4998.2s)]
*  You know had handcuffs my wrist when I was 11 years old [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5003.8s)]
*  Uh, whose mother didn't get her first job that gave her benefits until I was 14 [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5006.84s)]
*  And i'm now serving as the chief executive of my state like I am like i'm playing with house money right now [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5011.96s)]
*  And i'm loving the work that we're doing in maryland because I think maryland is leading the country [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5017.16s)]
*  In so many different things in terms of raising wages in terms of you know driving historic, uh, her stoke low unemployment rates [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5020.76s)]
*  Driving historic drops in violent crime being able to actually create wealth and wealth opportunities for everyone in our communities [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5027.56s)]
*  Like I love my job and I love what i'm doing and i'm also very clear that um that that uh, when I decided something [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5033.16s)]
*  Uh, no one can tell me different [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5040.76s)]
*  And uh, and and I know i'm not running for i'm not running for for anything else except i'm running for i'm running for reelection [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5043.16s)]
*  Uh next year and I hope people in my state give me an opportunity to uh to have another four years [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5048.52s)]
*  Well, then last question for you. Um, we need good presidential candidates in this party [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5052.92s)]
*  In general, how do you think the national democratic party is meeting this moment? [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5059.16s)]
*  It's a hard question because I don't um [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5064.12s)]
*  Honestly, I don't I don't focus on it [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5067.24s)]
*  That much I mean, you know and not just being just being totally honest like I when I remember when I ran for for governor [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5069.639999999999s)]
*  Um, we ran against there's like 12 there's like 11 other people running for governor. They had we had [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5075.639999999999s)]
*  statewide elected officials [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5081.38s)]
*  We had two obama cabinet secretaries. We have uh, we had a former head of the dnc [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5082.92s)]
*  Literally had a former head of the democratic party who ran for governor. Yeah, uh, and then me [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5087.8s)]
*  The guy who had never run for office before in my life [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5092.28s)]
*  Uh who was now saying hey [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5095.32s)]
*  I want to run for governor and I ended up getting more individual votes than anyone who'd ever run for governor in the history [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5097.0s)]
*  of the state of maryland [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5102.68s)]
*  Um, so I guess kind of my point is is that I was never the party's choice [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5103.96s)]
*  Before the party didn't ask me to run [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5108.52s)]
*  Uh, the party didn't come in and say you're the guy who we wanted to be the next governor of maryland the people did [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5111.64s)]
*  Um, and so I i've decided i'm not the best person to give the party [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5117.08s)]
*  Uh advice as to as to what they should do because I was never I was never the party's choice in the first place [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5121.56s)]
*  But I I do think that what does become really important in this moment is [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5127.16s)]
*  Is if you're not delivering results for people and if people don't find you to be authentic [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5131.56s)]
*  They're never going to support you [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5137.16s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like the reason that we are doing really nation-leading work around young men and boys [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5139.32s)]
*  Here in the state of maryland is not because we lost them as a voting bloc [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5146.52s)]
*  In 2024 and what are we now going to like now? [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5151.24s)]
*  The reason we've been doing this work since day one of our administration is because it was a core part of why I decided [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5154.4400000000005s)]
*  Getting this race in the first place [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5159.24s)]
*  And I think when you're looking at who voted for us and the fact that we did we've done very well with young men and boys [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5161.0s)]
*  In in our elections is because they know it's real [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5166.4400000000005s)]
*  And it's authentic [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5169.64s)]
*  Right the reason that we had the the reason that we uh that we focused on having a service here option making maryland the first [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5170.92s)]
*  State in this country that has a service here option for every one of our high school graduates [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5176.92s)]
*  It's not because it pulled well. In fact when I first went virtually it didn't pull well at all [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5181.0s)]
*  But it's because it's authentic [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5185.64s)]
*  And I believe in it and I believe in this time of this political divisiveness and political vitriol that service will save us [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5187.24s)]
*  And so I think that the I don't know the best the best advice I guess I can give [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5193.56s)]
*  Um, and again, I don't get my talking points from from the party [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5197.4800000000005s)]
*  um, but the thing that I would suggest that people do is is be authentic and [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5201.16s)]
*  Don't forget why you got in this business in the first place. And if you do that, I think the people will respond [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5206.04s)]
*  Because I think they'll see that you care about them [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5212.84s)]
*  You care about their families you care about their legacy and that you are doing everything in your power [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5215.64s)]
*  To be able to make sure that that uh that that's going to be that that's going to be protected [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5221.400000000001s)]
*  And I guess like we saw in our campaign, uh in our race that um, the people will reward you for [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5225.5599999999995s)]
*  That's good advice. You should be giving more to the party. Uh, governor westmore [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5231.639999999999s)]
*  Thank you so much for uh joining plaza of america. I appreciate it. Of course man. Great to talk to you again. Thank you [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y2nxfkl42k&t=5235.8s)]
