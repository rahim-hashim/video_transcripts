Video Description: Ben Smith, former media columnist at the New York Times and now the editor-in-chief of Semafor, joins Dan to talk about today's ultra-challenging news media landscape. The industry is significantly weaker than it was in 2016, and Trump's aggressive lawsuits have the executives in charge of CBS and ABC scrambling to appease him. Will the death blow for America's free press come from within? Smith runs through what we should have learned from the first Trump presidency, how cults of personality rule in journalism just like they rule in politics, and why the dominance of the Times is terrible for fascism-proofing the country.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Donald Trump and Elon Musk Broke The Media and We Have To Adjust (w/ Semafor's Ben Smith)
**Pod Save America:** [February 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w)
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Dan Pfeiffer. This is our second Sunday show. These episodes [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=0.0s)]
*  are going to be coming out every other weekend and will give us hosts a chance to step back [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  from the churn to have longer form conversations about the big ideas and forces shaping news and [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=8.72s)]
*  politics. My guest today is Ben Smith, the co-founder and editor in chief of the news [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=13.6s)]
*  site Semaphore. Ben is a longtime reporter. He worked for Politico, was the editor of BuzzFeed [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=17.76s)]
*  News and was the New York Times media critic. So he has a ton of experience covering the coverage [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=22.32s)]
*  from the prominence of podcasters and influencers in the 2024 election to the way Trump is running [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=26.64s)]
*  roughshod over the media. It feels like we are at a critical moment for the role of the fourth [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=30.96s)]
*  estate. That's why I wanted to bring Ben on to dig into the state of the American free press, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=34.88s)]
*  what journalists need to do differently for Trump 2.0 and whether the right has finally won the war [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  on the media. Ben Smith, welcome to the show. Thanks. Thanks for having me down. It's nice [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=43.6s)]
*  to see you. Absolutely. We've been together for a very long time. I think we first met on a [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  bus in Iowa in 2007. You were a blogger. I was. They were like, they were like, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=53.12s)]
*  we have an adult here to take charge of you all. And it was. And the adult, I think I was 29, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=60.72s)]
*  30 maybe at the time. So like a true adult. But look, we are, Trump's been in office for nearly [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=66.64s)]
*  three weeks. It has been a truly insane and intense three weeks. But we know that's part of his and [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=73.28s)]
*  Steve Bannon's flood the zone strategy. Bannon first described this approach in 2018. He said [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=78.88s)]
*  his strategy for overcoming the media's opposition was to flood the zone with shit. For our listeners, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=83.6s)]
*  let's take a listen to what he said on PBS's frontline back then. The opposition party is the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=87.36s)]
*  media and the media can only because they're dumb and they're lazy. They can only focus on one thing [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  at a time. And the one thing they'll mainly focus on is either they do the horse race or once the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=97.44s)]
*  horse race, who's in, who's out. It's like the high school, who the cool kids in the cafeteria, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=102.56s)]
*  because it's easy. It's the reason they do the horse race stuff all the time. And they won't do [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=108.0s)]
*  the basic, what are the core things that are going on in the country? I said, all we have to do is [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=111.52s)]
*  flood the zone. Every day we hit them with three things. They'll bite on one and we'll get all of [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=116.08s)]
*  our stuff done. Pang, bang, bang. These guys will never be able to recover. But we got to start [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  with muzzle velocity. So it's got to start and it's got to hammer. It's got muzzle velocity. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=127.6s)]
*  Seems like a pretty accurate description of what at least the first couple of weeks of Trump 2.0 [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=132.56s)]
*  look like. How have you been covering Trump 2.0 and how have you tried to deal with the flood the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=136.4s)]
*  zone strategy? It is a very accurate description. And I mean, is the media dumb and lazy? Like often, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=140.0s)]
*  also accurate. But I think, you know, he thinks the notion that the opposition party is the media [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  and that the world is totally mediated by the media and that we shape reality and decide what [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=153.84s)]
*  happens to me, like I don't really buy that. But I also think it's kind of poisonous for the media [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  to think that about itself in a way. And, you know, and I get, you know, I mean, we're trying [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=163.44s)]
*  to cover the story. We're trying to understand what's happening, why things are happening, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=168.88s)]
*  who's actually making these decisions, what their actual motives are, things that social media can [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=173.92s)]
*  often be shaky on. I mean, I think one of the big stories, one of the stories that struck me early, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=178.4s)]
*  you know, is that is obviously you have this iconic image of Mark Zuckerberg and at all sort of in, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=185.92s)]
*  you know, paying their show showing up to support Trump's inauguration and, and to sort of pledge [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=192.16000000000003s)]
*  their loyalty to the administration. And it was really striking to me a story we broke over the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=199.04000000000002s)]
*  weekend, that we know when it comes to key appointments, like the General Counsel for the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=202.96s)]
*  FCC, they pick somebody who is the most anti big tech possible lawyer in America, like this bought [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=206.96s)]
*  them nothing. The Trump people think it's hilarious. They like it. But they're not gonna, but it isn't [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=214.08s)]
*  buying them. It's not buying them anything. And then conversely, who has actual influence in the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=219.2s)]
*  White House, which who in media has Trump's respect, Rupert Murdoch, whose publications have been very, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=224.95999999999998s)]
*  very tough on Trump and call actually, if you read the Wall Street Journal editorial page, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=231.11999999999998s)]
*  you'll get much tougher, clearer criticism of Trump than you get from, you know, the LA Times, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=235.11999999999998s)]
*  which only writes about Los Angeles now, because they feel scared. It's an interesting thing. I [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=241.76s)]
*  think you see this is like demonstrations of weakness by a lot of kind of would be media moguls, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=245.44s)]
*  which they imagine are going to ingratiate themselves to the White House and there's no [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=250.72s)]
*  evidence that it is. Yeah, I want to get into some of those tributes that some of the media and tech [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=255.28s)]
*  are paying to Trump in a minute. But I think I'm not going to defend Steve Bannon often in the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=260.0s)]
*  history of Potsdamerica. But I think when he made those comments in 20, night, 2018, 2019, whatever [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=263.92s)]
*  it was, he, the world, it was a different place, right? The media did play the legacy media, if you [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=270.08s)]
*  will, just who he's really talking about, right? Like when we talk about media in this podcast, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=274.96s)]
*  that is everything from Semaphore to the New York Times to Fox News now to Joe Rogan, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=278.47999999999996s)]
*  Alex Cooper, everything. But what's been talked about here is he's talking about the White House [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=285.52s)]
*  press corps, right? The establishment media, legacy media, regime media, as Republicans call it. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=288.79999999999995s)]
*  And back then, it certainly played a larger role, I think, at least maybe you can, if you disagree, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=294.08s)]
*  you should say it inserted mediating reality. Yeah, they were reacting, of course, to a moment [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=298.32s)]
*  in which the Russia investigation had totally swamped the administration, driven by [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=302.96s)]
*  breathless media coverage. And they had gotten onto the back foot in the first weeks of the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=307.91999999999996s)]
*  administration were, and never really got onto the front foot. They were never, they were very rarely [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=311.84s)]
*  were they able to really drive that story. It was mostly they were, you know, they were the rabbit [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=316.56s)]
*  being pursued by the wolves. And so like, I think they were kind of honestly reasonably figured we [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=321.35999999999996s)]
*  don't want that to happen again. And that strategy, I mean, Bannon puts it in really bombastic terms, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=327.2s)]
*  but I don't know, do you think it's probably a good like, is that if you were a White House [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=331.68s)]
*  comms director, would you would you come out with muzzle velocity right now? Yeah, I think you would [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=334.72s)]
*  want muzzle velocity. I think the question for Trump, if you're if I'm stepping back from like [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=339.2s)]
*  the perspective of political operative is, are you telling a larger story? Or are you getting swamped [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=342.8s)]
*  by actually like what they are demonstrating right now is action, right? Just he's doing things. And [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=348.48s)]
*  that is standing in stark contrast to what people perceived of Biden, right? He was largely absent, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=354.32s)]
*  even though he did a lot of things. Most of a lot of those things weren't public. They didn't see him. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=361.04s)]
*  And so, you know, I was saying about this other day is that in Trump's first term, in the beginning, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=364.48s)]
*  he suffered, I think mightily in public perception with the comparison to Obama, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=370.08000000000004s)]
*  because he was out there is kind of saying dumb, crazy things. He was not thoughtful. And that [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=375.36s)]
*  and Obama was much more popular in Trump. So that suffered in this situation. I think he actually [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=380.8s)]
*  benefits from the comparison of Biden, because Biden was perceived to be fairly or unfairly as [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=384.48s)]
*  absent, not doing a lot, not not showing strength, not being out there. Trump is out there 24 seven, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=390.72s)]
*  right? Like when was the last time the public ever really saw Biden and Trump is out there all the [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=396.16s)]
*  time. So he benefits from it. The question will be like right now, that is a very good short term [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=399.44s)]
*  strategy. What are you like? What points are you putting on the board in terms of delivering [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=404.8s)]
*  your campaign promises? Right? Or is it just a bunch of noise? And that it's early to know [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=410.24s)]
*  whether that's actually true or not. Yeah. And the thing that I mean, I think Bennett is a smart guy [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=414.40000000000003s)]
*  in some ways. He's so ubiquitous that people underestimate how consequential he is. But [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=418.48s)]
*  notably absent from from the muzzle velocity speech is just like, which ways the gun pointed, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=425.6s)]
*  what's in it? Yeah, you know, right. And, and it's just, it's a strategy, it's kind of new content [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=431.20000000000005s)]
*  neutral. Like they could be announcing anything. And there was this narrative last year that well, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=437.28000000000003s)]
*  look, like this time around, Trump has a real plan. They had they know what they're doing. They have [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=443.28000000000003s)]
*  a set of actions planned. And some of the stuff coming out of the muzzle, like some of the [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=447.92s)]
*  particular immigration, I think is actually like, look, we had a plan, we're gonna do some high [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=452.48s)]
*  profile, even if they're not massive raids, we're gonna try to scare people away from the border, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=456.88s)]
*  we have some legal changes we want like that all felt planned. The Elon stuff is obviously, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=461.44s)]
*  he's just seeing tweets about agencies he's never heard of reacting, canceling stuff, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=466.0s)]
*  un-cancelling stuff. I mean, it's mostly improvisational. And I think that's, as you say, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=470.48s)]
*  at some point, these are the fights. I mean, I think, you know, it's in the laws of gravity [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=476.32s)]
*  still apply. Like you, the president has this hundred days has this moment at which to set an [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=480.4s)]
*  agenda to pick their priorities to pick the fights they're going to pick. And some of the fights [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=485.84s)]
*  they're picking are the fights they plan to pick and wanted to pick. But a lot of fights they're [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=489.92s)]
*  picking are the fights that Elon saw a tweet about yesterday. It is like they are better, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=492.72s)]
*  is a better run organization than last time only in the sense that you have a bunch of people who [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=497.36s)]
*  maybe care about a specific issue that Trump may or may not care about as much and they are [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=502.8s)]
*  finding ways to drive that. You know, some of it is not legally sustainable. Some of it is just [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=506.8s)]
*  like a bunch of bullshit like the executive order on transgender sports participation. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=512.08s)]
*  That's not something the government has any access to. But by just by being out there and [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=518.5600000000001s)]
*  being mobastic, you get, you know, likely the NCAA or someone else to respond to it. But they're [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=522.24s)]
*  actually like, they didn't have executive orders in the can last time to do it. And the ones they've [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=526.4s)]
*  written or there and I think they are Trump is freed this time from caring what the media thinks [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=532.64s)]
*  or at least he seems to be like they were very they were more sensitive to the you know, what [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=540.0s)]
*  Maggie Haberman would say about them. They seem to be now at least I think that remains to be seen. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=545.36s)]
*  I think at least let me say the administration question about Trump. Yeah, yeah, I do think that [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=549.92s)]
*  you're going to this is going to be a real question as you know, because they're just doing they are [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=554.4s)]
*  have a lot of Muslim velocity and as he said, like some of the stuff and a lot of it is kind of [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=557.84s)]
*  organizationally, you know, kind of culture war stuff that doesn't, that doesn't really affect [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=563.1999999999999s)]
*  the outcomes of government policy in an immediate way is all happening. It's moving, they clearly [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=568.24s)]
*  had it well planned. But again, I mean, a lot of the most consequential stuff is being decided by [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=572.96s)]
*  Elon Musk in a pretty chaotic way. And when it starts, and I think there's a real question of [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=576.56s)]
*  some of it will be very unpopular, some of it will get really bad press. Do we think Trump wants that [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=581.84s)]
*  like I actually don't think Trump likes getting bad pressers comfortable getting bad press. I think [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=586.64s)]
*  he likes it a good press. Yeah, I think that's true. I think so. I guess the way I've been [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=589.92s)]
*  thinking about it is I mean, the way he backed on the tariff backed off the tariffs very quickly [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=594.16s)]
*  for just basically nothing is notable the way they I know a judge stopped the funding freeze, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=598.3199999999999s)]
*  but Trump also pulled the plug on it and reportedly, I mean, at least it's the reporting I read was [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=604.16s)]
*  that was his choice because it was so noisy and messy. And so I think he's still going to be [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=608.88s)]
*  reactive to some of that stuff. The people around him are less reactive to it. Like last time he had [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=612.0s)]
*  so many Republican establishment people in his administration that they were more reactive to it. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=616.4s)]
*  And like, you know, John Kelly is going to be more reactive to bad press than Kristi Noem or [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=621.04s)]
*  or, you know, same thing with defense. Pete Hicks, Seth is not going to care about it, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=630.64s)]
*  you know. And so I think that it will matter. So I guess I guess my question to have is it seems [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=633.4399999999999s)]
*  to me at least watching this over the first three weeks that the legacy media establishment media, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=638.24s)]
*  right? I always want to kind of just at least the people in the briefing room in Trump one [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=642.88s)]
*  came in really sort of guns blazing, right? They sort of branded themselves as defenders [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=648.4s)]
*  of democracy. There was a ton of fact checking it. And there is a it feels like at least from [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=652.24s)]
*  afar, a different approach this time, right? A little more. Not that there is not real that [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=660.56s)]
*  like I do kind of want to separate the journalists who are covering the White House or covering Trump [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=666.0s)]
*  from maybe the parent companies who own them. But because there is like real like people are [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=670.88s)]
*  reporters, I will say are working their ass off in the writing, like a really a lot of really [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=675.84s)]
*  important stories, whether anyone's reading them or not is an open question. But it doesn't feel [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=679.04s)]
*  like the press is a little more accommodation. It has more of an accommodationist and less [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=683.52s)]
*  aggressive approach this time. Do you see it that way? My is just my is my anti-media bias coming [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=686.88s)]
*  through. I mean, I think that's one way to see it. I mean, I guess I never really bought the idea [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=691.68s)]
*  that like our choice is to be accommodationist versus collaborationist versus aggressive. Like [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=697.28s)]
*  we're supposed to be covering reality. And I think that there was an almost delusional quality to the [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=703.28s)]
*  media where reporters loved having people they met out in the world say to them like, wow, you're so [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=708.3199999999999s)]
*  brave. Thank you for what you do. It's like, come on, you cover the White House. Like you're not [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=714.24s)]
*  you're not a war reporter. And and I do think like the work is incredibly important to democracy. But [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=718.3199999999999s)]
*  that's a little different between saying, you know, journalism is this incredibly is this vital [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=724.72s)]
*  pillar of democracy and journalists are themselves heroes of democracy who wide right, you know, who [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=730.24s)]
*  ride around on white horses like it's a weird job. And the best reporters, right, like the reporters [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=735.36s)]
*  who are very valuable right now, like spend a lot of time kind of burrowing into Trump world and [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=739.9200000000001s)]
*  telling you what's happening there. That's you know, and that's an incredibly valuable thing. But [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=743.6800000000001s)]
*  you don't have to. I don't know. But I think there was a level at which the sort of media the media [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=747.44s)]
*  fell in love with a narrative about itself that, you know, that that that made liberals love them [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=753.12s)]
*  and conservatives hate them. And I don't know. And that's not the only factor, maybe even the most [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=759.36s)]
*  major factor. But but I don't think in retrospect, that was a good thing. And I would say the [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=762.96s)]
*  underlying thing here is just to go back, Trump gets elected and a lot of journalists, a lot of [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=766.64s)]
*  liberals think there's no way this was legitimate. Like this did something there has been a mistake [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=771.28s)]
*  here. And like what happened? Maybe it was Facebook, like maybe there's some technical social media [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=776.32s)]
*  trick, or maybe it was the Russians. And like these are two very great lines of reporting inquiry [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=780.8s)]
*  that lots of really smart journalists, and I don't think they're always framing the story that way. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=786.0799999999999s)]
*  But a lot of journalistic effort was expended basically trying to answer the question of how [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=790.4799999999999s)]
*  did Donald Trump manage to get elected. And those were both factors, obviously shifts in social media, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=795.4399999999999s)]
*  Russian interference in the election. But like, I think they did not like to like sufficiently [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=800.64s)]
*  consider option three, which was that he was pretty popular and won a lot of votes. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=805.8399999999999s)]
*  And so I think that was like Trump. People aren't wrong to be upset that most of the journalistic [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=810.88s)]
*  energy of 2016 2017 was expended on trying to figure out what trick got him elected. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=815.5999999999999s)]
*  We're going to take a quick break. But before we do that, look, it pains me to self promote like [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=821.28s)]

*  a pretty specious lawsuit that a lot of legal experts think ABC could have won involving [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1061.04s)]

*  But the, and then you have the reports that Paramount, which has a merger, a very large [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1077.6799999999998s)]

*  reportedly absurd lawsuit about the editing of the Kamala Harris interview, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1090.32s)]
*  just sort of as a publisher, a person that meet a long time media critic, what do you, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1094.3999999999999s)]
*  what's your response to how some of these entities are, are doing this? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1098.0s)]
*  You know, it's funny that for years, for our whole careers, there's been a set of advocates [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1101.36s)]
*  who yelled about the corporate consolidation of media. They're kind of like Ralph Nader people. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1107.1999999999998s)]
*  There's a group called Free Press. They were totally irrelevant to the political conversation, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1111.52s)]
*  like nice people. And you'd be like, yeah, I don't know. Like I work in corporate media and I've [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1115.4399999999998s)]
*  never had my corporate overlords cutting secret deals with the government. That doesn't, that's [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1118.4799999999998s)]
*  not the thing that happens in America. And they were totally right. Like you, what you see now is [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1122.8799999999999s)]
*  this very, very consolidated media is largely owned by on one hand, public companies that have [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1128.3200000000002s)]
*  fiduciary responsibilities, their shareholders. And when we say media really mean news media, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1134.3200000000002s)]
*  because they have lots of exposure beyond news. Like the Ellison family isn't buying Paramount [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1138.5600000000002s)]
*  because they want CBS News. Like CBS News comes along with the bargain and this kind of a headache, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1143.76s)]
*  but they want, you know, they're looking for a content library and, you know, they're getting [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1148.64s)]
*  into the movie business. And so this like CBS News is this liability. And actually the Disney suit [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1152.56s)]
*  is, you know, sort of specious, but it's the kind of suit sometimes you settle because I think they [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1159.28s)]
*  were worried about what was it, you know, George disclosing George Stephanopoulos' text messages, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1163.36s)]
*  whatever. There's some argument for settling that one. I'm not, I'm not a great one, but the CBS one [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1167.52s)]
*  is ludicrous. It's about editing. It's about, you know, like it's a very normal journalistic thing. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1172.3999999999999s)]
*  If you edit a, an interview the way you want to edit it, maybe you screw it up, maybe whatever, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1177.76s)]
*  but it's, but it's, it's, it's something that is widely viewed as protected and as a specious [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1181.84s)]
*  lawsuit, even, even if they've found a friendly judge in Texas. But see, you know, but CBS is, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1186.72s)]
*  but Sherry Redstone who's selling CBS would like to get paid. And the quickest way to getting paid [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1191.84s)]
*  is caving to Trump. And if that damages the brand, if that blows up the newsroom, it's not, it's not [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1196.32s)]
*  a big deal for her. I think similarly, you know, Bezos and Patrick Soon-Shong are billionaires. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1201.12s)]
*  And the issue is that they're billionaires is that they have lots of exposure in other businesses [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1206.72s)]
*  that the government has a lot of power over. Soon-Shong is in the healthcare business, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1210.4s)]
*  you know, FDA incredibly important to him. Bezos is very interested in his space projects [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1214.8000000000002s)]
*  and Trump will obviously punish them. I mean, he's done it in the past. He'll threaten the hill, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1220.0800000000002s)]
*  kill those, kill, kill contracts if your publication anchors him. And so, and Bezos wrote [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1223.76s)]
*  this in his letter about canceling the endorsement that it would be impo- and he said it is why I'm [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1231.76s)]
*  not doing this because I'm caving to Trump, but I can't, but I can't blame you for seeing it that [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1235.2800000000002s)]
*  way because it sure, I recognize that it looks that way. And I just think that what you see is [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1239.12s)]
*  that, you know, the thing that you, it makes you realize the importance of independent media and [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1244.8799999999999s)]
*  independent in sort of the old nato-right sense that they are independent of consolidated ownership. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1254.0s)]
*  I mean, the New York Times is the only major publication in the country that is independent [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1259.84s)]
*  in that sense. You know, the Murdoch press for all the many problems I have with them [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1264.16s)]
*  are at least in the news business in a real way and have some experience in dealing with power [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1271.28s)]
*  and not just caving. And then, and then lots of smaller outlets like ours, like yours and mine, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1276.64s)]
*  and you know, I'm sure like if the Trump administration decided to try to damage [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1283.1200000000001s)]
*  your business and go after your advertisers, it could probably do a lot of damage. But it's, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1286.0s)]
*  but you're not dealing with a sister company that is heavily regulated, that is, you know, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1290.4s)]
*  and we already, you know, and I think that's, that to me is actually kind of the scary thing [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1295.52s)]
*  is the way in which ownership is really being brought to bear for the first time in my career. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1299.76s)]
*  Soterios Johnson It is, there's just this ultimate irony that like the ABC settlement [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1304.64s)]
*  actually goes to the Trump library where one to ever be built. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1309.52s)]
*  John Greenewald It's going to be in New Greenland. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1312.32s)]
*  Soterios Johnson Right. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1313.92s)]
*  John Greenewald The Trump library. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1314.8s)]
*  Soterios Johnson Or it could be in Gaza. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1315.84s)]
*  Somebody in Trump's orbit described it to me as the Trump library and casino. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1317.6s)]
*  John Greenewald Yeah, I'm sure that I'm sure that is the [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1320.9599999999998s)]
*  game or in amusement park or whatever, whatever else it'll be. But it's just there's a tremendous [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1322.7199999999998s)]
*  irony. So ABC, Walt Disney and ABC have given Trump money for the library. If Paramount settles [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1326.4799999999998s)]
*  a suit, CBS will give Trump money for his library. Mark Zuckerberg just settled a suit with Facebook [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1331.76s)]
*  against Trump that will go to the library and the Trump is going to end up with a library [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1337.36s)]
*  built by the legacy media and big tech is just a sort of a wild thing you would not have expected. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1341.1999999999998s)]
*  You see why he finds that really satisfying. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1345.68s)]
*  Soterios Johnson I can imagine that he's quite satisfied [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1347.6000000000001s)]
*  in the first Trump term. Fact checking was a very important part of how the press was thinking [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1352.24s)]
*  about holding Trump accountable. Right. He is telling all these lies. It is our job to sort [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1356.72s)]
*  reality for our readers. We're going to fact check and we're going to do it. Bring on people like [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1360.64s)]
*  Daniel Dale and CNN right afterwards. And it I'm curious what how he how that's going to happen [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1364.96s)]
*  this time. Like here I want to have you listen to this clip from Trump's recent press conference [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1371.12s)]
*  where Peter Alexander tries to tries to question the reality of what Trump just said. Let's take a [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1375.76s)]
*  listen. Cited FAA text that you read is real, but the implications of this policy is newer than it [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1380.2399999999998s)]
*  stems from efforts that began under President Biden or the transportation secretary. Pete Buttigieg [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1385.6799999999998s)]
*  is demonstrably false. It's been on the FAA website. No, it's on the website. The FAA website. It was [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1390.8s)]
*  there in 2013. It was there for the entirety. What I read it was there for the entirety of [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1395.84s)]
*  your administration, too. So my question is, why didn't you change the policy during your first [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1400.0s)]
*  administration? I did change it. I changed the Obama policy and we had a very good policy. And [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1404.4s)]
*  then Biden came in and he changed it. And then when I came in two days, three days ago, I signed a new [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1409.12s)]
*  order bringing it to the highest level of intelligence. Okay. It was on the website. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1414.8s)]
*  Please. It was on the website. Quiet. So Peter Alexander here, who's the MSC news correspondent, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1420.08s)]
*  does exactly what you're supposed to do. Trump goes holds this press conference, makes a series [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1425.36s)]
*  of claims that are demonstrably not true. He corrects them on it. Trump runs right over him. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1429.2s)]
*  And I guess the question is, what value do you see in fact checking? Is it still an important [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1435.2s)]
*  part of journalism? Is it even possible when you have a president who you're an administration or [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1442.24s)]
*  even a political party right now who are willing to ignore reality? Yeah. I mean, I guess, you know, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1446.8s)]
*  as you know, I come from a slightly weird corner of the world. I never really liked the formalized [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1451.1200000000001s)]
*  fact checking. Like I think journalists job is to get the facts right and that you shouldn't [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1454.88s)]
*  outsource that to some other often Facebook funded or whatever institution populated by [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1458.24s)]
*  23 year olds who are learning how to do their jobs. But anyway, let me bracket that particular [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1464.32s)]
*  rant. No, I mean, I think there's a level of, I mean, the media, the news media is weaker than [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1468.48s)]
*  it used to be. It was weaker in 2016 than it thought it was. Maybe it realizes how weak it is [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1474.4s)]
*  now. But like, what, I mean, I think there's some question of what's the, like, we should get our [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1479.6s)]
*  facts right. We have a responsibility to our readers to tell them what's really going on. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1483.92s)]
*  Are we going to disabuse Trump supporters of things that they believe or the word of things [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1488.4s)]
*  that maybe aren't really being received as facts, but more as political statements or as, you know, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1496.48s)]
*  like, you know, I don't think it doesn't, it doesn't seem like it doesn't seem like we're [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1501.92s)]
*  the those fact checks were changing a lot of minds or reaching a lot of people who were looking to [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1505.6s)]
*  have the facts checked. And so I think that kind of formalized fact checking, like I mean, I, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1509.52s)]
*  I'm not sure what it was doing in the ad, like I say, like there's a fair amount of research on [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1514.24s)]
*  like media effect and media impact that like none of us actually wind up looking at that much. But [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1519.28s)]
*  I think it's often interesting to ask like, well, okay, well, like, did this retro, did we do some [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1524.56s)]
*  focus groups where this then changed people's minds and people came in thinking that one thing [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1529.2s)]
*  was happening and then what red fact check.com and left thing, you know, things happening. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1533.52s)]
*  Like, I don't really see a lot of that. I do think this is a real obvious case where [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1537.04s)]
*  there's a factual dispute. It is in fact, there's a journalist job to resolve it and say what is [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1541.04s)]
*  true. And for people who are looking for it to read the true thing, a lot of things that got [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1545.2s)]
*  fact checked were sometimes a little hazier were sometimes more political disputes is immigration [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1549.28s)]
*  good for the economy. Like that's not really a fact checkable claim. That's an argument among [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1554.8799999999999s)]
*  economists. Yeah. I mean, that was, I mean, even that's been a problem even in my days in government, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1558.96s)]
*  the like, I would rage at my desk at the Washington Post fact checker for taking a [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1563.84s)]
*  sort of a statement of values or a statement of principle and assigning some of their [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1569.44s)]
*  Pinocchios to it because you could find like you could, you could nitpick it in a way. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1573.04s)]
*  Yeah. It's most pedantic imaginable approach to politics. And I think sometimes kind of annoyed [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1578.0s)]
*  people and backfired in that way. But I think the broader question of, I mean, I, you know, there is, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1584.0s)]
*  I mean, this is honestly often true with the first wave of people who come into government, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1587.92s)]
*  that like, they believe some things that are just not true about reality and about how government [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1592.32s)]
*  works. And they come in with some things that they've said on the campaign trail about, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1596.56s)]
*  I mean, I think you saw this in the Biden administration with the Saudis, frankly, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1600.1599999999999s)]
*  like they had some views on Saudi Arabia that did not survive contact with reality and wound [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1603.9199999999998s)]
*  up being the Saudis best friends just to, just to kind of like think about one. But like, yeah, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1607.9199999999998s)]
*  I mean, that's a slightly, to me, that's a slightly different one, though. But for instance, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1612.24s)]
*  I wrote about this guy named Darren Beatty, who's, who's going to be in the State Department. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1615.12s)]
*  And it has some views on how like, they were, they were trying to orchestrate color revolutions, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1618.8799999999999s)]
*  like Eastern European style, the people who had orchestrated the color revolutions in Eastern [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1624.16s)]
*  Europe had come back here and were trying to orchestrate against Trump. Like, at some level, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1628.3200000000002s)]
*  that's a factual claim. Like, do we think that happened? And he's, yeah, and I do think that [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1632.0800000000002s)]
*  they, I'm sort of more interested in some ways in people who are like arriving with Trump with a [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1636.5600000000002s)]
*  set of beliefs that may or may not, like they, because I think the one thing that people [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1642.0800000000002s)]
*  underestimate is a lot of the people who are saying things, they believe the things they're [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1645.52s)]
*  saying. Some of it is nonsense. Bannon, I think often will just like tell, tell, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1650.08s)]
*  spin yarns, whose details are not all true, and doesn't believe all of them. But a lot of these [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1654.08s)]
*  folks like believe what they're saying. Like, I think RFK mostly believes the things he says about [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1658.3999999999999s)]
*  vaccines. On a day to day basis, as you cover politics or government or what everything in the [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1662.24s)]
*  world you're covering, like, what do you like, what is your what it like, what do you say to your [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1667.28s)]
*  reports is your task? Yeah, I mean, I think, I mean, you know, I think we are trying to speak to [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1670.96s)]
*  a really informed audience that has to understand what's actually going on, because they're [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1677.44s)]
*  encountering it in the world of business, economics, politics. I mean, actually, you know, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1681.3600000000001s)]
*  the business press often is more reliable than the political press, because they are talking to people [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1688.24s)]
*  who have to make, you know, to have to trade stocks, have to make decisions based on reality. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1692.4s)]
*  So and I so I think, you know, obviously, so we obviously see that as our responsibility. We also, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1697.6s)]
*  I mean, I do think it's a moment when you sort of have to have bring some humility as a journalist, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1701.2s)]
*  whether you like it or not, because we have the industry, like we have less power than we did. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1705.84s)]
*  And we definitely do try to do two specific things. And one is to try to say to readers, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1709.84s)]
*  because I do think people live in these deep information bubbles. And it's not that you [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1715.4399999999998s)]
*  necessarily believe the things that are being said on Fox News. But it is important if you're a [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1718.72s)]
*  listener of Patsy to probably know what they're talking about some of the time, like what, like, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1723.04s)]
*  literally what Republican legislators are walking into the house with no idea what the Democratic [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1726.56s)]
*  colleagues like read that morning. And the Democrats have no idea what the Republicans were [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1731.6s)]
*  reading. And so we have this very popular feature called blind spot that's literally like we're not [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1735.12s)]
*  trying to arbitrate the reality this often these are true stories just with different emphasis, [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1739.1999999999998s)]
*  totally different emphasis. But the Republicans are talking about some crime committed by an [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1743.84s)]
*  illegal immigrant in Colorado. And the Democrats are talking about some just totally different [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1748.08s)]
*  story, right. And I think some level of just trying to say like this is giving a glimpse of [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1752.7199999999998s)]
*  the reality that the other side is living in is pretty useful. I mean, just act sort of actionably [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1758.1599999999999s)]
*  useful. And, and sometimes I do think social media is a machine for taking the stupidest thing [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1762.4s)]
*  that your opponent said, and elevate the stupidest version of the stupidest thing they think, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1768.0s)]
*  and constantly barraging you with it. And there might there might be someone in there who's [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1773.2s)]
*  actually making a reasonable case you could argue with, but it will be totally swept away [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1778.24s)]
*  in social media. And I think we do try to sort of elevate, you know, to elevate the stronger arguments [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1781.52s)]
*  and to try to like, create some space for reasonable disagreement. So I think there's a fair amount of [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1785.76s)]
*  that, too. Although there's also, as you say, like, some, like eroding shared factual basis around [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1790.32s)]
*  this for sure. The I think you're the blind spot thing is very interesting, because in my career [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1798.72s)]
*  in politics, one of the things that was a fundamental shift in how government and politics [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1804.8799999999999s)]
*  worked was the moment republics and democrats stopped reading the same media, which probably [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1810.72s)]
*  happened about midway through the Obama years, is for you know, for like, totally, there was like, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1814.96s)]
*  the people would pretend like they were playing a part, right, particularly in the like, around 2010, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1820.64s)]
*  when the Tea Party took off, a lot of Republicans were sort of, they were appealing to the base, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1825.04s)]
*  but they were still reading the New York Times, they were still reading Politico, they were [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1830.48s)]
*  everything else. And so they, we were operating under the same set of reality, at least in a [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1833.52s)]
*  private negotiation, you were having over legislation, we all sort of agreed on the same reality. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1837.76s)]
*  Right about, I would say midway through the Obama's, through Obama's second term, kind of [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1843.1200000000001s)]
*  when Facebook became, Republicans radicalized a little bit after Obama's reelection, Fox News [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1846.88s)]
*  became sort of more powerful. And then that the sort of right wing media ecosystem took off sort [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1852.16s)]
*  of powered by Facebook, that was the Breitbart era, Daily Caller, right around 2014 is like, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1856.8s)]
*  we stopped having the same reality, we were having completely different conversations. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1861.52s)]
*  And it is like, so that speaks to governing and in politics, it is, there's the difference it has [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1865.6s)]
*  been that and it's, I think this might be changing a little bit for better, for probably for worse, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1872.56s)]
*  is that Democrats had a media diet that was primarily legacy media, still we're still in [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1876.8799999999999s)]
*  the New York Times, we'll see NPR, maybe we skew a little on the, the more left leaning part of that [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1882.48s)]
*  legacy media diet, but it was traditional media abiding by the rules of journalism as commonly [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1887.92s)]
*  understood. And the Republicans had shifted to something totally different that did not abide by [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1894.0s)]
*  and often sort of spat in the face of those rules. And that now we are fully in that moment where [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1898.0s)]
*  the Trump administration and Republicans writ large up and down, you know, it's not just in [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1904.4s)]
*  Washington, it's everywhere, are exist in this wholly other media ecosystem and that media [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1908.16s)]
*  ecosystem is becoming much more, much less clear to anyone else, because it's not, it's not like, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1912.24s)]
*  yes, you could turn off Fox News and that would be a very good idiot's guide to what the right is [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1920.32s)]
*  thinking. But that's often, I think in this day and age, it's kind of a lagging indicator of what's [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1924.64s)]
*  really bubbling up. Like, are you like, do you know what's happening on rumble? Are you watching, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1928.24s)]
*  you know, are you listening to the Daily Wire or reading Barry Weiss or some of these other things [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1933.04s)]
*  that are, you know, really affecting it? Yeah, it's a very, it's an incredibly fragmented system [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1936.64s)]
*  that you're describing. And I mean, like, right, like there's a big distance between rumble and [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1943.52s)]
*  Barry Weiss. These are all different things. I think there are parts of it, I think that I was [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1946.48s)]
*  talking to a really prominent conservative podcaster who was saying that, you know, they [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1950.88s)]
*  spent a lot of their time complaining about the, you know, journalists and everything, they get [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1955.1200000000001s)]
*  wrong. And then once in a while, there'll be a holiday. And they're like, where is the flow of [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1960.56s)]
*  news? And it's for me to talk about. It's so annoying. And it's like, oh, all the people I hate [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1964.24s)]
*  are like, taking vacation with their kids. And so there's no fodder for me. There's no [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1969.6s)]
*  underlying information. I do think there's this question that, you know, gets kicked around. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1973.9199999999998s)]
*  So it was actually Tucker Carlson founded the Daily Caller to solve this. It did not, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1979.1999999999998s)]
*  which is that there's no real center right, far right reporting apparatus or not much of one. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1983.28s)]
*  Actually, one of the things that distinguishes Breitbart from the others is they do some original [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1988.56s)]
*  reporting. Most of the places, a lot of the places that in that world podcasters are really [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1991.84s)]
*  commentating and reacting and or reacting to things they've seen on social media, which really are [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=1996.48s)]
*  often made up. And there's like a lack of a kind of baseline of, yeah, I mean, it would be healthy [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2001.2s)]
*  if the Trump movement developed more reporting muscles, honestly. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2008.88s)]
*  You've mentioned a couple of times here that the media is weaker than it has been and maybe [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2013.92s)]
*  recognize its weakness. I think just to put that sort of in perspective, right, we had the 2024 [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2018.48s)]
*  election where the candidates interacted less with the media than at any point. Trump did famously [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2023.3600000000001s)]
*  no interviews with a mainstream media organization for the last, you know, whatever was month of the [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2029.6799999999998s)]
*  campaign. Harris did historically few. They took few Harris took a few questions from the press. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2035.36s)]
*  Then and then you have just, you know, you have to, you know, drop in cable, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2041.52s)]
*  subscriptage, cable subscriptions, ratings, the economics, you know, sort of the Washington [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2046.8s)]
*  Post is losing money. Just the media has been weaker, is weaker at this point than it has been [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2052.56s)]
*  in any time. And so I kind of like at the same and on top of that, sort of the credibility [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2057.28s)]
*  and the reach of the of the legacy media is, is obviously at its nadir. Is it fair to wonder [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2064.0s)]
*  whether the right who's been raising a decades long war against the media has now won that war? [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2070.88s)]
*  Yeah, I think that I mean, yes, I think that's an that's that's a reasonable thing to say, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2074.96s)]
*  like, what's the prize for winning that war? I'm not sure. I mean, there's a couple just when you [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2079.36s)]
*  talk about trust, like the polling data here is worth looking at, because it's interesting. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2083.52s)]
*  And basically, what you see is that like starting with Dan Rather, actually, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2087.2000000000003s)]
*  all of the decline in trust in the media is among Republicans, like independence, pretty flat, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2091.2000000000003s)]
*  Democrats, pretty flat. But you see this decline starting with Dan Rather, you know, for [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2096.08s)]
*  Republican saying that the public and start saying the media is too liberal. And then at some point, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2102.32s)]
*  the Trump years, it flips from the media is too liberal to the media is making everything up. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2107.2000000000003s)]
*  And that's a huge difference. And that's sort of what you're talking about. It used to be [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2112.4s)]
*  a shared reality in which Republicans complain about the refs, sometimes justifiably to a situation [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2116.0s)]
*  which they believe that the whole thing is made up. And that is a big shift. And then the final [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2122.2400000000002s)]
*  thing that is kind of dispiriting is the one place that trust media is eroding among Democrats is [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2126.4s)]
*  among young people. And that's happening pretty fast now. And it's they just this is Gallup polling. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2130.4s)]
*  Right. And I and I've done I was I saw a lot of focus groups, a lot of research in how [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2136.56s)]
*  Gen Z gets their news and just the idea of going to a website to get news is like we never it doesn't [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2141.2000000000003s)]
*  even occur to them the idea that you would turn on the television to watch news years and years ago. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2149.84s)]
*  I asked my daughter, you know, if she if she knew about Huffington Post, and she was like, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2154.32s)]
*  Oh, is that is that something in Safari? Yeah, that's right. Just mean, you wrote about this [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2159.12s)]
*  in your book. And you've talked about a lot of the interviews when you're talking about a couple [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2163.92s)]
*  years ago, but is just the sort of where we so you have you have two things you have lack of [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2166.64s)]
*  trust in media, which is a problem and growing among Democrats, particularly among young people. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2172.7999999999997s)]
*  You have what I think is actually a distribution crisis in news, which is, you know, sort of the [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2178.3199999999997s)]
*  short version history I always do is that if you were a person who was not a news junkie [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2184.4s)]
*  in the pre internet era, you had to see the news some form of news, you would bump into it [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2189.92s)]
*  organically because someone literally threw a newspaper at your door every morning or if you [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2194.0s)]
*  had to open that if you wanted to know when the movies were the baseball score, the weather, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2197.68s)]
*  like some happening local town, you would see headlines, right? If you wanted to know the new, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2201.76s)]
*  you wanted to know the weather the next day, you had to turn on the six o'clock news. And you and [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2205.2s)]
*  you would see news that way. And then we kind of we moved from newspapers. I mean, this has been [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2209.6s)]
*  your whole career. We shifted to we can we train some group of people that they should go to [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2214.24s)]
*  www.nytimes.com or www.politico.com in the morning at the same like the same way you would [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2218.8s)]
*  grab a cup of coffee and read a dead tree newspaper, you would grab a cup of coffee and [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2225.44s)]
*  pull up your laptop or your if it was at a certain year, your iPad and you would look at a website [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2229.76s)]
*  and read the news that way. Maybe the first thing you did at work, right was you would sit down and [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2233.6000000000004s)]
*  read the news. Then social media came and we have like we have a better plan. Facebook's going to [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2237.36s)]
*  deliver the news to your phone. You're going to see it. And even if you're just like scrolling [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2243.04s)]
*  through for your look at pictures of your friends, kids or whatever else, you know, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2246.88s)]
*  Facebook, we have killing time in the grocery store waiting in line. You would see some sort [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2251.04s)]
*  of news and then some point after 20 and Twitter served the same function for a small group of [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2254.88s)]
*  people. Then around 20 sometime after 2020, that all fell apart. Right. And now it's like, how do [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2259.2000000000003s)]
*  people get like there is no district, there is no major distribution mechanism for legacy media to [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2265.28s)]
*  reach people who are not actively seeking it out. Right. That is the thing that has changed. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2273.12s)]
*  I think that's a really good way to put it. I mean, I would say, you know, that these things [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2277.68s)]
*  keep changing. Like it's I don't think it's reached a static point. I think that the thing [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2281.7599999999998s)]
*  that you described, which sounds incredibly disorienting and maddening, most people, most [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2285.12s)]
*  consumers hate. Like if you ask people like, hey, do you think this is working for you? Do you like [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2288.64s)]
*  how you're getting your news? No, everybody hates it. And I think that's, I mean, that was sort of [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2292.08s)]
*  what we were reacting to in creating some before was like just why, you know, why I left the times, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2295.2799999999997s)]
*  just this sense of like, oh, there's actually an opportunity to like, like to not to respond to the [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2301.44s)]
*  fact that people feel totally disoriented, feel like they don't know what to trust and try to [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2307.12s)]
*  address that stuff directly. And I think and I think you're seeing so I think that, I mean, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2312.7200000000003s)]
*  ultimately, we live in this very, very dynamic free market society in which consumers do even even in [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2316.64s)]
*  news and news is sometimes an exception to that, like the tradition in news is if the consumers say, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2323.44s)]
*  we hate you and everything you're doing, we say, fuck you, you're wrong. But but I think there is [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2328.32s)]
*  this opportunity for both legacy and for new outlets to take pretty seriously, how terrible [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2334.4s)]
*  the experience of consuming news is, and a lot of the pendulum swing is back to some of the older [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2340.0s)]
*  values. Like, I think the reason that email newsletters are very popular is they actually [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2346.2400000000002s)]
*  are kind of print, like they force a kind of hierarchy of saying what's important. They force [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2349.52s)]
*  kind of concision because they're not infinite. And I think that's made them very popular. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2355.04s)]
*  And I think so I guess I mean, I'm obviously an optimist, because I wouldn't still be doing [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2360.64s)]
*  this stuff. But but I do think that the current the status quo is always is kind of untenable. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2364.72s)]
*  And the fragmentation commercially is extremely annoying to like, how many subtexts do you want [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2370.64s)]
*  to subscribe to? How many different streaming services are you going to pay for? Like, and I [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2375.2s)]
*  think there's a very aggressive push and will be over a couple years to reconsolidate that stuff, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2379.44s)]
*  like for better or for worse, but you'll have one subscription to newsletters, you'll have [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2385.36s)]
*  two streaming services, they'll all swallow each other. Again, that could be bad, or that could be [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2388.88s)]
*  good. But I think that experience of just like, absolute disorientation and fragmentation, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2392.8s)]
*  like is terrible. And everyone knows it. And so there are a lot of opportunities to fix it. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2398.0s)]
*  Yeah, the question I think like, I agree with that, like, we are sort of in a moment. And [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2402.0s)]
*  this is not like you can do that have the same conversation about, you know, just content services [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2407.12s)]
*  beyond news, right? Like, we're totally are you really going to be going to really pay for how [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2412.0s)]
*  many people or how many streaming services you're going to pay for, you know, YouTube TV, which has [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2415.92s)]
*  become very popular is basically just cable through the internet, right? So like, it looks [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2419.76s)]
*  at the same format. So how are you going to like, is there a way to get back to it? But I wanted to [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2423.36s)]
*  sort of get back to the the role of the media, because it like, like, we're like, you and I are [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2426.7200000000003s)]
*  to like, right now, this conversation about distribution is about the business of media, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2433.84s)]
*  right? Like, how do you because ultimately, you need readers to make money, whether that's [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2437.84s)]
*  gonna be subscriptions or, you know, or average or how you get ads in front of people, whatever, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2440.96s)]
*  or whatever that is. Just to stop you, though, I see where you're like, I think I agree with [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2446.7200000000003s)]
*  where you're going. The extent to which all of everything we're talking about the chaos, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2450.6400000000003s)]
*  this disruption is all fundamentally driven by these huge technological shifts that we've [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2455.04s)]
*  seen. Like that is the underlying thing here. It's not little choices made by journalists here and [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2459.68s)]
*  there. No, no, no, no, I fundamentally agree with that. And it is, I think I think you can, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2465.2000000000003s)]
*  you point out a couple of them as you can point back at various choices made by people in the [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2470.2400000000002s)]
*  media, like in the media, you do two things you do the business of media, like giving away your [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2476.4s)]
*  product for free on the internet for a few years, probably in hindsight, not not the best move or, [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2480.96s)]
*  you know, optimizing a Facebook or whatever else like you can do, you can do some things. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2485.2000000000003s)]
*  You can also point to some journalistic choices that have eroded trust fairly or unfairly, right? [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2489.2000000000003s)]
*  You pick the Dan Rather, just the entire coverage of the Iraq War in the run up to it. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2493.28s)]
*  That is the biggest one. Yeah. Yeah. But then you also have cultural shifts that have happened, [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2497.84s)]
*  which is in how young people think about news. Like what is one thing you see when you do [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2503.44s)]
*  sort of focus groups of younger folks is they find they find more authority and more relatable, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2508.8s)]
*  a piece of content that looks like the conversation you and I are having more than [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2515.84s)]
*  nine pundits at an anchor desk for CNN. Like that, like when they think of news, it is, you know, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2519.76s)]
*  people with headphones on on a couch or around a table having a podcast or it's a streamer [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2525.2000000000003s)]
*  speaking, you know, doing a vertical video that is to them what true like the sort of traditional [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2529.52s)]
*  image of Walter Cronkite or Dan Rather or Brian Williams at the anchor desk is to previous [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2533.6s)]
*  generations. I mean, it's funny, we on our podcast, Mixed Signals, we interviewed Colin and Sameer, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2538.24s)]
*  who are big, big YouTubers who think a lot about who sort of talk a lot and think about YouTube. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2542.64s)]
*  And at one point I said to Sameer, like, I mean, so when did you start thinking of yourself as a [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2547.2799999999997s)]
*  journalist? Like, how did you get into journalism? He was like, what? Don't call me that. That's [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2551.68s)]
*  offensive. Yeah. And that was a pretty striking thing to me. It's a very it's a very it's a [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2556.24s)]
*  totally different ecosystem. But I just want to get back sort of to the role that the media has [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2561.04s)]
*  played in sort of politics and public discourse, because that to me has been a fundamental shift [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2566.88s)]
*  is it was a measure of accountability. We call it the fourth state for a reason. You interacted [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2571.44s)]
*  with the media as a politician or a governmental entity because you, you know, for two reasons. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2578.72s)]
*  One, you needed the media to get your message out. Like that was a fundamental thing. Like [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2584.0s)]
*  if I was preparing Barack Obama for a press conference, like, like, yeah, like the [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2588.6400000000003s)]
*  falsity and bargain in my head is I'm going to take a bunch of questions that are going to be [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2593.6800000000003s)]
*  annoying. They're going to be about the things that I know voters don't care about. But the price of [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2597.52s)]
*  that is the airwaves to get. It's the way I can get my message in front of people. And you would [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2601.1200000000003s)]
*  react to, you know, the media could if they picked a thing that they were going to become the [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2607.2000000000003s)]
*  narrative, what could change government policy? Right. It would be it would create such a [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2612.6400000000003s)]
*  firestorm that you wouldn't have to stop doing it or change course or whatever else. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2616.64s)]
*  I do sort of question after watching this election, the first couple of weeks of Trump, [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2622.4s)]
*  whether like it seems like that role is so diminished as to be, is that the media becomes [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2626.72s)]
*  maybe this is for better, not for worse from your perspective, but more observe, [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2635.12s)]
*  almost entirely an observer and chronicler of the process, opposed to a participant when it was a [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2639.52s)]
*  huge participant in politics for basically since the invention of the newspaper. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2643.52s)]
*  Yeah. I think I don't think it's a binary thing, but yeah, but I think the media's role in being [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2648.88s)]
*  able to sort of set the agenda essentially is obviously diminished, you know, to some degree [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2653.6s)]
*  given over to whatever like a non on Twitter caught Elon's eye this morning. Like right now, [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2658.32s)]
*  that's what's driving. That's what you'll see on Fox tomorrow morning and in the White House the [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2663.28s)]
*  next day. Like that's, you know, is literally random people tweeting in Elon's replies. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2667.12s)]
*  But and I guess, yeah, and I think that the media can overplay, you know, can overplay. Yeah, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2674.64s)]
*  I do have some ambivalence about that role. We definitely, I think we are able, like Semaphore [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2680.08s)]
*  has been able to build a lot of trust with Republicans and Democrats, partly because we do [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2686.7999999999997s)]
*  we see our lane as narrower, right? Like we're trying to tell you what's going on and provide [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2691.2s)]
*  really good information, but not ultimately resolve the argument. That said, I mean, I do [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2695.68s)]
*  think there I do think that there's a long tradition of people in American politics who [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2702.96s)]
*  think they can shape reality. I mean, there was a famous, was it Carl? Who was it in the [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2706.8799999999997s)]
*  in the Bush administration? Carl Rove. It was Carl Rove in the New York Times. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2711.6s)]
*  Yeah, told Robert Draper that they were going to shape, they didn't have to be accountable [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2714.96s)]
*  to the reality based community anymore. And at some point, journalism is the reality based [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2719.8399999999997s)]

*  citizen as a voters are going to wind up having to react to. And I don't think we've I don't think [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2733.76s)]

*  to get a bunch of reporters, you like, let's, inflation is an example, right? It did not matter [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2907.76s)]
*  what the New York Times or CNN or Semaphore or anyone else wrote about inflation. People still [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2913.44s)]
*  went to the grocery store and were paying more for eggs, right? Or milk or whatever. That is [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2917.12s)]
*  reality. The thing that is, I think, harder is people are less informed about what's happening [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2921.44s)]
*  now because it's harder to get news. You have this gigantic gap now. We saw this in a bunch of the [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2928.1600000000003s)]
*  polling. There was NBC polling. Before Biden dropped out, you had Navigator Research Polling [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2934.8s)]
*  afterwards, which just shows that the biggest gap in politics is not left and right. It's news [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2939.2s)]
*  consumers and non-news consumers. And it does go to the irony, which I'm sure you might find quite [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2943.2s)]
*  sweet, that all the Democrats who've been screaming at myself sometimes, including who've been [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2947.7599999999998s)]
*  screaming about New York Times headlines turned out to be the New York Times readers are the ones [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2951.2s)]
*  who were most likely to support Biden or Harris and the people who did not read the news. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2955.2799999999997s)]
*  You do just sort of have this question. To me, that chasm is growing so much larger, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2961.3599999999997s)]
*  really since 2020, I think. That to me is a crisis for democracy. All this stuff, [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2966.88s)]
*  you mentioned Elon 50 times, as you should. It's one of the biggest stories, maybe in [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2975.04s)]
*  generations of American politics, we have the world's richest man possibly running rush shot [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2980.6400000000003s)]
*  over laws and rules and norms to just reshape government without any sort of accountability. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2985.12s)]
*  How many people are actually consuming any of that? How do you get that information to them? [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2992.96s)]
*  Is that your job, I guess, is the question? [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=2997.84s)]
*  Those are all really good questions. I guess I would say it's certainly nothing like the democracy [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3002.88s)]
*  that we grew up in in the 20th century with a very unusually stable, unusually centrist media. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3008.96s)]
*  It's a lot like 19th century American democracy. I think that there is something about what we're [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3015.52s)]
*  seeing is a small D democratic media that's an absolutely chaotic, hyper-partisan, untrustworthy [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3024.72s)]
*  mess that is very embedded in the history of democracy. I'm not saying that is a good thing, [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3031.9199999999996s)]
*  but I do think that the kind of thing that we know that honestly by the beginnings of our careers [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3040.3999999999996s)]
*  was already in trouble, the sort of broadcast, the Walter Cronkite thing, that was the blip. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3045.3599999999997s)]
*  Right? I mean, this is the norm. You talked a lot of Republicans, [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3051.76s)]
*  talked to a lot of Democrats. Do you think Republicans better understand this media [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3054.5600000000004s)]
*  environment than Democrats? I think that in this moment after the election, everybody thinks that [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3059.0400000000004s)]
*  the winning side figured it out and that the losers are morons and everybody is gearing up [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3066.0s)]
*  to refight the last war and every CEO, every politician is going to be booking themselves [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3072.48s)]
*  onto a bunch of podcasts nobody listens to for the next four years. But then in fact, [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3077.52s)]
*  and then always the world changes faster than they expect. I think we're headed back into [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3083.76s)]
*  a moment of consolidation basically and that there's going to be a recentralization of audiences [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3087.12s)]
*  and of content and that some poor hapless congressional candidate is going to spend [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3091.6s)]
*  300 hours talking to podcasts nobody listens to, to no discernible effect. I don't know. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3096.88s)]
*  But also, I mean, there's a lot like, I don't know, but also the Trump years have, I mean, [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3102.96s)]
*  the consolidation of power in Washington is also really new in media, right? Like the extent to [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3111.44s)]
*  which media executives are obsessed with what the administration can do to hurt them. It's true [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3116.0s)]
*  across business. We're hosting this huge World Economic Summit here in April and just the appetite [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3123.28s)]
*  of CEOs in America to get to Washington to figure out what is going on is really new. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3128.48s)]
*  Say a little bit more about when you're moving back to a more centralized media. I don't think, [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3135.76s)]
*  I assume you don't mean ideologically. What do you mean by that? [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3140.64s)]
*  Oh, just, you know, I mean, it was technological. If you needed, for the late 20th century, [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3143.28s)]
*  you needed a broadcast tower or a printing press if you wanted to reach a lot of people. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3147.2s)]
*  And not that many people had them. Spectrum was regulated. And so like you really had this very, [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3151.76s)]
*  I mean, for technological reasons, fundamentally, there were, as you said about distribution, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3156.4s)]
*  the system was meant and then, and then the business incentives of those were to sell [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3161.36s)]
*  mattresses to Republicans and to Democrats. And often that led to something that we look, [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3165.6800000000003s)]
*  that we romanticize actually a kind of so centrist media, but it also did produce this kind of false [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3170.32s)]
*  consensus around Iraq, which as you say, is part of why everybody lost trust in that kind of media. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3175.04s)]
*  But the fundamental change was technological, the split in the fact you didn't need these broadcast [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3180.7200000000003s)]
*  towers anymore. And so I just think it's hard to imagine going back to that. And, you know, [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3184.48s)]
*  there are out, like we definitely see for readers, part of the value is like, and I think you do this [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3189.68s)]
*  too. Like we can read everything so you don't have to go out into the, put on the hazmat suit [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3194.2400000000002s)]
*  and go out into social media and find the interesting stuff. Some of which is on weird [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3199.36s)]
*  sub stacks and right wing podcasts, and some of which is in the New York Times. And it's [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3204.0s)]
*  this very disorienting moment to be a media consumer. Yeah, that's one of the things that [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3207.84s)]
*  I think with like my media business head on is that one of the places where there is opportunity [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3212.08s)]
*  is basically curation. Yeah. I mean, that's at Semaphore. That's so much of what we do. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3219.68s)]
*  And you have to build trust with the audiences to trust you. And that is, you're like, for better or [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3224.7999999999997s)]
*  for worse, that trust is, you know, you can build brand trust as I'm sure you guys are trying to do [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3231.2799999999997s)]
*  at Semaphore, but it's often with people. With individuals. Totally. Yes. Right. It's like, [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3234.56s)]
*  I trust Joe Rogan to tell me what's happening. I trust Ezra Klein to tell me what's happening. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3238.8s)]
*  I trust Potsdam America, whoever else. And I mean, you've done that a little with some of your [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3242.5600000000004s)]
*  reporters trying to lift them up like Dave Weigel, like with his newsletter, I guess, is sort of like. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3246.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, we definitely are building around expert reporters on key beats in a way that in the old [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3249.6000000000004s)]
*  days, you would just, you're all cogs in the dispensable cogs in the Wall Street Journal [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3255.44s)]
*  machine. And now if you're Liz Hoffman on Wall Street or Burgess Everett in the Senate, like [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3259.1200000000003s)]
*  you trust a person. And it's a very, it's a very, it's a interesting time to be in this business, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3264.08s)]
*  for sure. Speaking of sort of that sort of curation role, I was thinking, I went back and read [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3270.4s)]
*  your first column as the New York Times media critic, which was claiming that your brand new [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3276.56s)]
*  employer, the New York Times had grown so successful that it was bad for business. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3281.36s)]
*  Since then, the New York Times has become even bigger, even better read. And it's, you know, [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3285.28s)]
*  putative competitors that have become, have struggled mightily since then. Washington Post, [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3291.04s)]
*  most notably, Wall Street Journal still does well, but has head layoffs, etc. And so, you know, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3296.4s)]
*  where do you think the New York Times stands right now? Do you still believe it's bad for journalism? [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3302.72s)]
*  I mean, I actually think it's scary for the New York Times. Like you don't want to be the sole [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3305.92s)]
*  strong independent outlet in a kind of democracy where rule of law is a little shaky. Like that's [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3310.72s)]
*  a bad place to be. You mean just because you have a big, you have a target on you? [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3316.8s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. And it'd be healthier for the media ecosystem and healthier for the Times and [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3320.4s)]
*  better for the leverage of journalists and their salary negotiations. If there were lots of big [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3324.96s)]
*  competing outlets with sort of somewhat different outlooks on the world, like I mean, that's just a [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3330.64s)]
*  healthier system. And, and I don't know, I mean, I'm hopeful that a couple of other legacy outlets, [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3334.56s)]
*  the Wall Street Journal, maybe CNN, get their acts together and that long, long term places like the [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3341.04s)]
*  Washington Post can pull it out. And then I do think there's a lot of, I mean, I do think that, [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3345.84s)]
*  again, if you go back to like, if you ask people, if you ask your listeners, like, do you think this [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3349.84s)]
*  is all great and you're satisfied with what you're getting, or do you want new stuff? People really [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3354.88s)]
*  are hungry for new ways of getting information, for new voices, for somebody who will go out, [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3358.96s)]
*  as you say, and just like sort through all the lunacy for them. And so I think, I mean, I think [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3363.76s)]
*  there's, I mean, I think, you know, it's, we're in this moment of crazy transition and there'll be a [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3368.32s)]
*  bunch of new things too. But yeah, no, I do think, I mean, I think it's in no one's interest to have [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3372.0s)]
*  one absolutely dominant and defending company. I sort of feel like The New York Times has become [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3377.12s)]
*  Netflix for news, where it's just, it's the place you go for every, it is replaced, sort of the way [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3382.4s)]
*  Netflix has replaced television, right? You want- Does Netflix have taste, right? Like Netflix has [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3387.52s)]
*  the stuff that is targeted at conservative people in the middle of the country and the stuff that's [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3392.16s)]
*  targeted at liberals in the coast. They have everything. And The New York Times obviously [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3395.92s)]
*  brings with it a brand that exists, but it is- Yeah, kind of political cultural lands. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3400.32s)]
*  If I am just like, I want to find out what is happening right now in this moment, [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3406.56s)]
*  my default place to go would just be The New York Times, right? I know like it's 2005, right? [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3410.96s)]
*  Cause like for 10 years and the 15 years in the middle, Twitter was where I got, where I would [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3415.12s)]
*  have gone to see that. Now you can't use social media for that. Like you just can't ask the [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3419.76s)]
*  question of what is going on and have it answered. Yeah. You can't just open up Twitter and have it [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3423.28s)]
*  be at the top of your feed in the way it was before from a trusted, you know, a reporter or [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3427.44s)]
*  a news outlet you knew that had been verified by Twitter. And you want to know what's going on. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3432.56s)]
*  And you want to know what's more important than what else? Like you want to know where on the page [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3437.2799999999997s)]
*  it is. You want some hierarchy actually in the chaos. No, I mean, that's the opportunity that [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3440.08s)]
*  we see ourselves as running at for sure. But it's like right now for a lot of people, I think who [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3444.96s)]
*  are sort of in the serious news consumer, it's like, you want to know what's happening in sports. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3449.2s)]
*  Maybe you go to ESPN or maybe you go to The New York Times and read the athletic, right? You want [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3452.7999999999997s)]
*  to know how to cook something, you go there. You want to play a game, you go there. You want to know [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3455.68s)]
*  what's happening. You go there. You want to know who's winning the Grammys. You open up The New [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3462.16s)]
*  York Times app and they are telling you as they come in where they are. It's just it is like it [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3467.3599999999997s)]
*  is such a dominant position in the ecosystem that it has. It is to me, I really feel like it has [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3471.2s)]
*  replaced the conglomerate of major news sources you were all getting from Twitter or. Yeah, [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3477.6s)]
*  it's replaced like the Internet. Yeah, yeah, it is the Internet for news, right? In the way that [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3485.3599999999997s)]
*  Netflix is the Internet for TV and movies, primarily TV. Yeah, and then you can get a [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3490.64s)]
*  bunch of bespoke stuff around the edges. But ultimately, no, I think that's I think that's [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3494.7999999999997s)]
*  really true right now. But I think we're also sort of in this moment when podcasts like this one, [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3499.8399999999997s)]
*  like, what is this? Is this a part of a video? Is it television? It's true. It is. It's long form [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3505.2s)]
*  contact. Lots of people will be watching this on a big screen on YouTube. And at some point, [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3511.3599999999997s)]
*  somebody is going to come and make us both wear makeup to do this. So we like our skin looks less [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3515.2799999999997s)]
*  weird. And then like suddenly we're just like idiots in boxes screaming at each other just like [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3518.72s)]
*  cable. And I think like there's a really, really fast convergence happening between what we used [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3522.72s)]
*  to call podcasts and what we used to call television. And I don't quite know where that [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3528.16s)]
*  lands. But I think that's people don't quite realize the speed at which that's happening and [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3531.9199999999996s)]
*  which that's going to be a kind of re-centralized form of consumption. You see it ESPN, right? You [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3536.16s)]
*  see Pat McAfee out in the afternoons on ESPN. It's like what's happening here? Like one guy's head [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3541.2799999999997s)]
*  is bigger than the other guy's head. I mean, there is the conventions of television as we know it [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3545.2s)]
*  are coming down, particularly news particular. And the things that people don't sort of realize [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3550.0s)]
*  who sort of even like people even who work in journalism or who are in the communications [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3557.6s)]
*  field in politics or PR or wherever else is there is still like a old world mentality that's hard [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3561.9199999999996s)]
*  to break out of because you're always people. People, a lot of people are generationally [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3567.04s)]
*  like frozen in amber. And when they started in media, I think that's very true politicians. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3571.4399999999996s)]
*  Every single one of us. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3575.68s)]
*  But I think some people and I give you kind of this point have you have been in different, [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3577.2799999999997s)]
*  you were a tabloid reporter in New York City. You were a blogger when blogs took off and sort of [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3583.52s)]
*  the RSS feed became the you've ridden the wave. I've tried to ride the wave as well. But like the [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3589.4399999999996s)]
*  facts that you sort of realize is one, the biggest podcasting platform in the world is not Spotify, [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3596.0s)]
*  it's YouTube. And that a shocking it would the numbers of people who watch YouTube on their [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3602.48s)]
*  actual smart TV in their house shocks people that it's so many people. Yeah, would you like [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3609.84s)]
*  put on nicer clothes if you really thought about it? I put on a sweat. Normally I'm wearing a t [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3614.88s)]
*  shirt. I put on an actual sweater. This is very nice. I would not have put on a sport coat because [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3618.96s)]
*  this is this is a podcast. This is this is not a funeral court, funeral wedding or court date. So [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3622.96s)]
*  I see. But you're also running a media business and like, you must be thinking like, why don't you [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3631.12s)]
*  have like some hour of MSNBC? Why isn't Podsave providing an hour to CNN or MSNBC or something? [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3637.12s)]
*  Why are they paying these people way more than you would charge them to provide an hour of [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3643.52s)]
*  programming? Like, don't you see that stuff converging? I think you can see that converging, [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3648.08s)]
*  whether how it converges, whether it can actually can like this, this has been the challenge for [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3652.96s)]
*  most media organizations. You've you've witnessed this is it is truly with the exception of the [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3658.48s)]
*  New York Times. There is not a good example of a previous legacy media organization that has made [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3663.28s)]
*  an actual transition to digital. Right. It is just like they cannot do it. Some, you know, some like [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3668.8s)]
*  Politico start digitally. Right. Like you had like when you started there, there was an actual [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3675.76s)]
*  newspaper that people read over lunch at Capitol Hill. But it was a digital first publication. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3679.84s)]
*  Yeah. And but no one else can do it because they are I mean, it is to the great credit of the New [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3684.32s)]
*  York Times as from a business story of pulling that off. But people can't actually do it. ESPN [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3690.56s)]
*  is trying to do it. And maybe they'll be successful with like Pat McAvee is an example of it. But it [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3695.92s)]
*  is. Disney is trying to do it. It is right. It is incredibly hard. But it just seems to me that [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3700.56s)]
*  people are producing podcasters are producing shows that are more interesting than most of [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3705.52s)]
*  what's on TV. And they have big audience and big followings. They're doing it for like a tiny [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3710.32s)]
*  fraction of the cost of producing an hour of television. And meanwhile, television is running [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3714.48s)]
*  out of money. And it just seems to me that set of factors means inevitably that I'm going to like, [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3718.88s)]
*  you know, be in a dentist's office and see your face very soon. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3723.6000000000004s)]
*  Well, I hope not. Not my face, but maybe some other face. But there is a little of everything [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3726.96s)]
*  is old is new again, which is there for a long time. The thing ESPN ran all morning was just [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3731.1200000000003s)]
*  a video feed of ESPN radio shows because ESPN radio was where the money was. And so it's just [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3735.52s)]
*  like you would just watch Mike and Mike every morning. Yes. And I miss another example. I mean, [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3740.56s)]
*  Howard Stern. Yeah, this is that. Right. This is not a complicated business. And so and so what [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3744.56s)]
*  is that? But then like, what does that mean for this super fragmented political landscape? I [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3749.92s)]
*  actually think it means it gets a little less fragmented than that these kind of recoalesces [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3754.08s)]
*  around really, really big individual voices, probably more than I mean, like the Megyn Kelly's [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3758.32s)]
*  of the world, like you guys. I mean, there's there's sort of a reconsolidation around a [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3763.12s)]
*  relatively smaller number of really big voices. It's like how you think of channels is different [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3769.6s)]
*  because it's not it's not like a network channel. It is either a media network that is centered [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3774.56s)]
*  around a podcast like Crooked Media or Daily Wire or Alex Kuper's Unwilled Network or whatever [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3782.4s)]
*  that you like because you and then usually you're entering it because of the talent at the top. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3788.64s)]
*  And then that gives you entry into the other people. But it just it exists very differently. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3792.64s)]
*  I think you asked me the question about like, why not CNN, MSNBC? The thing that I watch, [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3798.0s)]
*  you know, I talk a lot of people in the progressive media space is the thing you have to be careful [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3803.7599999999998s)]
*  not to do is is take your new thing and then just rebuild the failed model of the. Oh, yeah. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3807.2s)]
*  You see this in Substack a lot where there are, you know, the economics of Substack are great when [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3813.68s)]
*  you're small. When you start hiring a bunch of reporters and doing that, you're right back to [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3817.52s)]
*  where you were before, which is it becomes very hard to support it. So how can you do something [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3821.68s)]
*  that is new and stays new? I think we are just like this is the reason I want to have this [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3827.04s)]
*  conversation with you of all people today is we are just in a fascinating moment in media and [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3831.52s)]
*  politics is media politics is the is the war for attention. Politics is the information war. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3836.96s)]
*  And so these things interact in a way that are just sort of critically important to and it's just [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3841.44s)]
*  happening so fast. Like I used to say that when I left the White House in 2015, that the period of [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3847.52s)]
*  time from when I went to work for Obama, which was before the iPhone came out to the time I left when [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3853.76s)]
*  Facebook and Twitter and Snapchat were becoming dominant or was like the fastest period of change [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3858.1600000000003s)]
*  in media since the invention of the printing press. And I think actually the change from when [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3864.08s)]
*  I left it now is greater than that, I think. Yeah, you were there for this almost very linear story. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3868.6400000000003s)]
*  It felt like this rocket ship, but we could see where it was going. And then at some point, [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3875.2799999999997s)]
*  it just exploded. And the whole thing exploded and new things came and the powerful legacy media [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3878.8s)]
*  changed dramatically because of technology, because of economics, etc. Yeah, I think there's a big open [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3884.8s)]
*  question of whether this splintering new right wing media, like what becomes of it? Does it create [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ0mOgsLG-w&t=3888.72s)]
