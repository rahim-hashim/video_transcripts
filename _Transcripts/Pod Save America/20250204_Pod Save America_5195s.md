Video Description: With Donald Trump's blessing, Elon Musk and a small crew of inexperienced software engineers take near full control of the government, moving to shut down USAID and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and taking control of a critical payment system at the Treasury Department. Trump delays his trade war with Canada and Mexico by a month after securing minor concessions that were probably already in the works. Meanwhile, congressional Democrats begin to push back harder—though whether it'll be enough is still an open question. Jon, Lovett, and Tommy break down all the latest, and Lovett speaks with former Obama and Biden economic adviser Brian Deese about just how bad things could get if a real trade war kicks off over the next four years.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

*  I'm Tommy Vitor on today's show [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=15.84s)]
*  We got Donald Trump and Elon Musk seizing control of the federal government's money spigot [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=17.92s)]
*  accessing all of our private information like Social Security numbers purging federal law enforcement of [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=22.8s)]
*  Nonpartisan FBI agents and prosecutors who aren't loyal to Trump and shutting down multi-billion dollar agencies [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  That they're not legally authorized to eliminate starting with USAID [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=33.88s)]
*  We'll hear from a USAID vet about what is actually happening and what it means [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=38.32s)]
*  We'll also talk about the Democrats who seem like they're trying to get off the mat [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=42.68s)]
*  over the weekend the party elected Ken Martin as its new chair and Democrats in Congress are starting to use the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=47.84s)]
*  Limited power they have to fight back and later [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=52.78s)]
*  Love it talks tariffs with our old friend Brian Deese who is a top economic adviser to presidents Obama and Biden [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=55.82s)]
*  But first America's dumbest trade war with two of its closest allies and biggest trading partners [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=62.660000000000004s)]
*  Seems to have ended before it even began [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=69.38s)]
*  We started today [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=72.54s)]
*  Ready to talk about a trade war and then just before we started recording first Mexico's goes down then Canada goes down [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=74.42s)]
*  Trade war is over if you want it [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=81.76s)]
*  so over the weekend Trump announced 10 percent tariffs on Chinese goods and [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=84.4s)]
*  25 percent tariffs on goods from our toughest adversaries Canada and Mexico [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=89.28s)]
*  That would mean every time a US company imports products from those countries food cars medicine electronics [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  They would have to pay an extra tax to the US government [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=101.16000000000001s)]
*  And then most companies would make up for the added expense by raising the prices they charge American consumers [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=105.17999999999999s)]
*  The tariffs were scheduled to go into effect on Tuesday night [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=111.3s)]
*  But then Trump agreed to last-minute deals with both Canada and Mexico to pause tariffs for one month [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=114.41999999999999s)]
*  Mexican president Claudia Shane bomb agreed to send [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=121.1s)]
*  10,000 additional troops to the border to help with illegal immigration and drug smuggling [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=125.02s)]
*  Which Mexico also did at the beginning of Joe Biden's administration? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=130.18s)]
*  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada would implement the 1.3 billion dollar border plan that it had already announced in December [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=134.06s)]
*  Launch a Canada US Joint Strike Force to fight drug smuggling and money laundering which it also announced in December [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=141.57999999999998s)]
*  and the new thing a point of fentanyl czar a [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=149.26s)]
*  Canadian fentanyl czar that guys always leave for work [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=153.78s)]
*  As [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=156.1s)]
*  God as far as we know as of this recording on Monday afternoon the tariffs on China are still going into effect as planned [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=159.9s)]
*  Though we're keeping a close eye on Xi Jinping's Twitter feed. Just gotta keep a close eye on that while we're recording [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=167.78s)]
*  Now why was Trump doing all this in the first place? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=174.74s)]
*  Here's a sampling of the explanations he's offered over the last few days including threats to start trade wars with our European allies as well [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=177.66s)]
*  Tariffs on they owe us a lot of money and I'm sure they're gonna pay UK is out of line [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=186.14s)]
*  But I'm sure that would I think that one can be worked out. But the European Union is [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=192.34s)]
*  It's an atrocity [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=198.66s)]
*  We may have short-term some little pain and people understand that Canada has been very [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=200.98s)]
*  Abusive of the United States for many years what I'd like to see Canada become our 51st state as a state [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=207.57999999999998s)]
*  It's different as a state. It's much different and there are no tariffs [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=213.94s)]
*  So I'd love to see that but some people say that would be a long shot [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=218.85999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, some people do say that's a long shot. He doesn't be so bizarre right after that which was [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=224.46s)]
*  If they if if people were smart about the pain they'd be for it, but they're not smart about the pain. He says to me deeply [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=230.38s)]
*  Deeply troubling that's that's right after unlike him right after [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=238.72s)]
*  All right. What do you guys think did did Mexico and Canada cave to Trump's pressure and just his his tough negotiating [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=243.24s)]
*  tactics or are these just a [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=250.96s)]
*  Fake concessions that just let everyone save face [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=253.2s)]
*  It seems as though Trump really enjoyed beating the ever-loving shit out of the Colombians and now he's like feeling tough [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=261.04s)]
*  He's ready to move up the chain of regional economies [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=267.44s)]
*  And he's taking that that that quick victory out for a spin [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=271.24s)]
*  Are we like King Hippo if it's Mike Tyson punch out where we are [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=274.96s)]
*  I never got the timing right? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=279.56s)]
*  Who's the first person I always struggled? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=282.16s)]
*  Yeah, I was like terrible. That's like the drunk Russian. Yeah [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=284.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean the the fentanyl czar is gonna have some free time cuz I think [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=290.88s)]
*  USCP had some data about seizures at the northern border in 2022 2023 and 2024 and they found [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=295.08s)]
*  70 pounds of fentanyl at the northern border as compared to over [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=301.48s)]
*  66,000 pounds at the southern border [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=305.56s)]
*  So I don't think the fentanyl issue was one with Canada as much as it was with Mexico and with China also [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=307.28s)]
*  He's he he said some number. I think he said like there were 200,000 fentanyl deaths, but the number is actually [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=313.2s)]
*  Lower and had been dropping and so he's already gonna be able to declare that he's brought the number down [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=319.52s)]
*  You know, he can already from his fake number. Here's so obviously [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=324.32s)]
*  Trump thinks this is a big win. He'll get some coverage that says it's a win from from regime media [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=329.36s)]
*  Mm-hmm and his people his his supporters will all say it's a big win [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=335.59999999999997s)]
*  Maybe some low info voters out there if they're paying attention at all [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=340.96s)]
*  We'll see headlines and think oh, maybe Trump won but as you heard in the clip [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=345.4s)]
*  Trump's [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=350.72s)]
*  Problems at least his stated problems with Mexico and Canada, especially Canada is that they have abused us. They've treated us poorly [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=351.72s)]
*  Economically, he's got all these economic concerns about both of them. He doesn't like the trade [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=358.28000000000003s)]
*  He says that we don't even need Canada for all the stuff that we buy from them. We can make it all here [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=361.92s)]
*  this is ridiculous and [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=367.16s)]
*  Yet all he got from either of them were [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=369.40000000000003s)]
*  Announcements about border security that they had already made were already implementing or had already implemented in the past [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=372.72s)]
*  Without threats of a trade war so I don't I don't know what he got at all or what he's doing [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=379.8s)]
*  There's a there's a potential that as they as he tries to renegotiate [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=385.59999999999997s)]
*  Trade deals with Canada and Mexico because he's gonna open up the trade deal that he himself negotiated with them last time [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=390.68s)]
*  That maybe he'll try to bring up some of these issues again [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=397.56s)]
*  You know, he's upset about a trade deficit. I guess [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=402.12s)]
*  But I don't know I don't think he I don't think he got anything [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=405.92s)]
*  Yeah [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=408.20000000000005s)]
*  There was a moment he did a yet another press availability from the oval this morning sort of his daily ritual at this point [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=408.64000000000004s)]
*  And he said who the hell negotiated these deals you did. Yeah Jared Kushner did we're in your deals [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=414.32s)]
*  We're all your these are all part of your deal. Yeah, it's hard to it's like [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=419.08000000000004s)]
*  You know [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=423.68s)]
*  We've just been in this endless. We were right for recordings [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=425.0s)]
*  I like I wonder what's Trump Trump's Trump is thinking about this which is always just sort of a fool's errand to try to figure [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=427.56s)]
*  Out so you never know like is this one that we face much of the show around and that's the contradiction [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=432.16s)]
*  at the heart of this show, but [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=437.08000000000004s)]
*  But it's it's are we like and I think there's always a mix right between [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=439.72s)]
*  His sort of feral desire for just new cycles, right? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=444.36s)]
*  He's just he's ravenous for new cycles and he's he got a great one out of Columbia [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=447.6s)]
*  He's gonna declare that this was a great. He feels this is a great one for him, right? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=451.24s)]
*  He threatens these tariffs the media goes nuts [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=454.6s)]
*  He gets these concessions that he can brag about declare victory and we're on to the next fight tomorrow [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=457.92s)]
*  But then part of it also is he is this is now a cycle, right? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=463.16s)]
*  He has said I will tariff you unless you come to the table and negotiate [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=466.56s)]
*  All right, they can't he's showing that you know, they they never apply this on on sanctions [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=470.20000000000005s)]
*  But they do on on tariffs, which is the way you prove that you that if you concede something [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=474.92s)]
*  You might be rewarded by Trump is he withdrew them, right? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=478.68s)]
*  He's willing to be capricious and put in place these disastrous tariffs that would harm both countries [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=481.5s)]
*  But he's also willing at a moment's notice to withdraw them. So it's he's setting now. We have a 30-day cycle [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=485.5s)]
*  We're gonna do this again in 30 days [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=491.84s)]
*  I guess yeah [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=493.15999999999997s)]
*  I think just it's gonna be a lot easier to get either real concessions or just lip service of the Canadians and the Mexicans than [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=493.78s)]
*  Will be out of the Chinese Xi Jinping is not going to bend or break easily. And so it does look like [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=498.85999999999996s)]
*  Ultimately, I think the results matter a lot less to Trump than the politics [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=505.74s)]
*  There were stories in the Wall Street Journal a week ago about how the Canadians like didn't know what he wanted [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=509.67999999999995s)]
*  They were on the other end of this fight. They didn't know what they were negotiating [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=514.3s)]
*  Turns out the answer was a fentanyl czar. Yeah, they want a new czar and but like Trump looks like he's taking action [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=517.9s)]
*  He's getting stuff done. He's making progress [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=523.46s)]
*  He's picking big fights. So it's splashy. It's getting covered. You're right state media is covering it [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=526.22s)]
*  But so is every other news outlet that's you know, trying to follow this administration [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=531.06s)]
*  So I think it's really smart politics for him. I think though that you just have to ask yourself like [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=534.9s)]
*  Justin Trudeau and Claudia Shane bomb right now. What are they thinking? Are they thinking? Oh, he really got us [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=539.7399999999999s)]
*  No, probably not because they didn't have to give up anything. Well true does out of a job. So he's thinking right [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=545.4599999999999s)]
*  It's not like sure everyone can say whatever they want and he can say whatever you want about how he pulled one over on people [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=551.66s)]
*  but like the two the two people the two countries he supposedly pulled one over on are probably pretty happy right now because [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=557.78s)]
*  There's no trade war and they didn't have to spend any more money than they were going to I was um [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=564.06s)]
*  I clicked on over to click over on over to CNBC to see what those guys were up to [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=569.0999999999999s)]
*  I don't really check in with them very much. How they're doing. It was a great day [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=573.02s)]
*  They're there every day, you know, which is crazy [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=575.3399999999999s)]
*  But yeah, Jim Jim Kramer this morning said he was that's really bad and it's gonna be a really long bad day [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=577.5799999999999s)]
*  Well, you know what you do with the Jim Kramer prediction. Mmm, that's the other side [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=582.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, almost exclusively but but they had the oil industry types on to talk about [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=585.9799999999999s)]
*  What they thought about all of a sudden they were all being very very careful not to say anything to offend mr [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=592.3s)]
*  Trump but they talked about how they had negotiated basically from their own pressure they had pushed for Trump to lower the [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=597.02s)]
*  The tariffs on oil, right? So it's you know, like why is he doing that? Well, he's facing [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=604.26s)]
*  He's the lobbyists are getting through which is just a reminder by the way that tariffs are a great mechanism for Trump [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=608.86s)]
*  not just have new cycles but to [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=613.3000000000001s)]
*  Keep American industries in heel [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=615.9s)]
*  but you say it's like a you know, I'm sure they're relieved that these tariffs aren't going into effect, but [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=619.26s)]
*  The like the the auto industry that is incredibly interdependent is [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=624.1s)]
*  Jeopardized by the threat of these looming tariffs that will hang over these companies for months to come based on these freedom trader grants build a whole bunch of [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=629.98s)]
*  of [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=637.3s)]
*  Interdependent industries oil refineries and all the rest that depend on the United States not being a malicious actor that [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=639.22s)]
*  Suddenly on a dime decides they're going to throw a giant tariff on on our closest neighbor [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=645.1800000000001s)]
*  And so like yeah, like we're on the other side of this right now [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=649.74s)]
*  But the threat is still there and Trump knows that the perspective threat of tariffs is more useful to him than ever implementing them [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=653.62s)]
*  Sure, but I don't know how you get out of a cycle where people start to decide the United States is not worth doing business with [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=659.54s)]
*  Right. No. No, I think I think the whole thing is damaging for sure [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=665.7s)]
*  I'm damaging to us probably as people want to do business with us because at some point someone's gonna say well [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=669.1s)]
*  I'm gonna call this bluff because so far he all he does for the his first term [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=675.26s)]
*  And now this term is he threatens and then maybe he slaps a small tariff on something or targeted tariffs here [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=679.78s)]
*  But it's not not really a big deal. I also think that [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=686.7s)]
*  You know, there was this whole debate. Is he using the tariffs as a negotiating threat or does he just really? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=690.46s)]
*  believe that tariffs are good and [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=696.9s)]
*  By nominating and then confirming Scott Besson for Treasury Secretary he seemed to be of the view that [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=699.86s)]
*  Tariffs are just a good negotiating tactic [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=706.38s)]
*  But then of course over the weekend when it seemed like that was gonna happen all of the MAGA people are all arguing [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=708.86s)]
*  Trump's point that tariffs are actually great and this is you know, Trump himself posted [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=714.34s)]
*  We should get rid of the income tax and just have tariffs and these tariffs are gonna fill our coffers [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=718.42s)]
*  And we're gonna have so much more money and we're gonna show these countries a little but it's like [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=723.06s)]
*  Well, what happened to that now we have the JD Vance here the case is you throw in the tariffs and you create a big domestic [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=726.74s)]
*  Industry, but these are all long game proposals [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=731.7s)]
*  It will take decades to play out and Trump's just sticking around and doing a political move like it's clearly just naked politics [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=734.1s)]
*  He wants to look like he's taking action. I think it's pretty effective in that sense. Yeah, I [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=739.86s)]
*  But like when I woke up I was like, let's see what's happening with this trade war and I just checked the Dow [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=744.9000000000001s)]
*  I don't know if I checked the Dow in the morning about a Dow checking guy [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=749.3000000000001s)]
*  but then you look and it's like the the the people that are like [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=751.7s)]
*  You know so keyed into this are not that afraid right it like went down a little bit [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=754.8199999999999s)]
*  Then they saw the Mexican deal and I kind of ticked back up again [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=758.3s)]
*  So they all like there was a kind of collective belief that I at the moment in the morning [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=760.74s)]
*  I was like it's either a delusion or not that this Trump is just bluffing [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=764.9399999999999s)]
*  he doesn't actually want to do this, but Trump is so emboldened and [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=769.02s)]
*  Gains so much power from the fact that we don't totally know what he'll do [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=772.6999999999999s)]
*  We're not really sure what he means and like we pay for that [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=775.74s)]
*  We pay for that by the fact that the whole the whole world today was focused on whether it was gonna happen [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=778.62s)]
*  Yeah, I also don't I don't really understand [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=782.06s)]
*  I know how he thinks about it, but I don't really understand what kind of political win [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=784.66s)]
*  He thinks he's getting two weeks into his administration in one news cycle. It's like great [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=788.38s)]
*  Yeah, everyone's gonna forget about it [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=794.02s)]
*  And you know days until we get unless we get 30 days from now and then you know [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=795.5799999999999s)]
*  He makes up some other big fucking problem that Canada and Mexico doing he does this all over again [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=799.66s)]
*  Yeah, I just think it's like the casual news observer the just the headline person like you see with Trump [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=804.02s)]

*  He leads the president has essentially given Elon Musk the keys to the kingdom and the world's richest man is now acting like he's the [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=966.1600000000001s)]
*  One people voted for here's the headline from the libs over at the Wall Street Journal [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=972.2s)]
*  Musk moves with lightning speed to exert control over the government [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=976.5999999999999s)]
*  Elon and his gang of a gen z doge bros [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=981.5999999999999s)]
*  Mmm, I got a couple of 19 20 21 year olds right out of college fresh out of college [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=984.92s)]
*  Now they are just running around the federal government Jesse who is in the Oval Office today. Oh, yeah, Rupert Murdoch and [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=990.12s)]
*  And Larry Ellison well Rupert hang out during the during the press avail [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=997.4399999999999s)]
*  They asked Trump about the Wall Street Journal saying that this was Trump's dumbest trade war [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1001.76s)]
*  He didn't love that and he didn't like it [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1006.56s)]
*  He said he's got to bring that up with Rupert and I guess he really meant it that day [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1008.2399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, there we didn't talk about that there I did I did wonder if some of the market stuff and and [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1013.3199999999999s)]
*  Rupert and Wall Street Journal and like the the old establishment Republicans that basically no longer exist started getting him like hey [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1020.04s)]
*  The the markets could be fucked here [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1026.1s)]
*  Well, this was the whole thing the whole first term his China policy was flip-flopping back and forth between hardline hawks and the market [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1027.8s)]
*  Whisperers like Mnuchin and others who were saying don't do it. You don't want to doubt to go down [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1034.6399999999999s)]
*  You want the S&P to drop? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1038.9199999999998s)]
*  So anyway, so Elon and all of his fucking nerds they're running throughout the federal government now [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1040.52s)]
*  They demanded and ultimately won access to the Treasury Department's payment system [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1045.8799999999999s)]
*  Which is how the government pays its bills and delivers benefits to people that are already mandated by law [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1052.48s)]
*  So by the time it gets to the payment system, it's it's all a bunch of career officials. They're nonpartisan [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1059.1s)]
*  They're just like it's just the spigot. They're just turning it on. All right now we're just paying the bills [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1064.28s)]
*  So now this means that Elon and his his crew has access to the personal information of every US taxpayer [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1069.12s)]
*  Social security numbers all of it Elon then claimed without any evidence whatsoever [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1077.72s)]
*  That Treasury he discovered the Treasury was making illegal payments including to some terrorists and then he was shutting them down [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1082.36s)]
*  Seems bad. What's what's your level of alarm on this one guys? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1091.84s)]
*  Presumably we're mailing the checks to those terrorists. So probably see that address go there [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1094.84s)]
*  Yeah, Uncle Sam's Venmo. Do we have the Isis account? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1100.04s)]
*  Like seems like that's like a year kind of over promising and [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1104.08s)]
*  Under-delivering if you found terrorists in the payment system, we'll see where the checks are. I meant hummus not Hamas [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1108.08s)]
*  So how do we route that money in the wrong place? Who are we sending hummus to? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1112.6799999999998s)]
*  No, it was payment for [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1116.96s)]
*  We split that app. It's where I was hummus for Hamas. It's this portionally and condoms [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1119.8799999999999s)]
*  Which was just made up and you said it again. Yeah. Anyway, this this is pretty I didn't first of all [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1125.28s)]
*  I didn't know that Uncle Sam had a Venmo. This seems [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1130.68s)]
*  alarming and unprecedented [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1133.8400000000001s)]
*  Like Elon Musk is an unelected tech billionaire [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1135.76s)]
*  wrestling away congressional authority to spend money and the Treasury Department's role in the whole process and I don't know like this [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1139.24s)]
*  Vindictive unstable man calling USAID evil and leftist Marxists [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1146.28s)]
*  Terrorist supporters. This all seems like a pretty bad setup. I [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1151.8s)]
*  Forgot to mention that when they originally demanded access [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1155.24s)]
*  they were told no by the career official in charge of the [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1158.32s)]
*  payment system at Treasury who was acting Treasury Secretary at the time before Besant was confirmed and [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1162.28s)]
*  Had been appointed I believe by Donald Trump in the first administration [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1169.12s)]
*  So this is no crazy Marxist lib and he said no, that's crazy [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1172.76s)]
*  You can't access to the paint system. You're not like this group of kids that you brought in from Silicon Valley [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1177.6s)]
*  They're not even government employees and they don't have they don't have security clearances [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1183.92s)]
*  No, we're not giving you access to the sensitive payment system that distributes trillions of dollars every year and [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1188.28s)]
*  Then he had to step aside. They got him right out of there. It's also you know, it's um, it's like a it's [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1195.2s)]
*  It's obviously like the the most sort of sensational example [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1201.68s)]
*  But it's also just if your goal is getting government spending under control [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1207.2s)]
*  Obviously, this is dangerous and unhinged [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1214.28s)]
*  It's also very stupid because if you're trying to get overall government spending under control [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1216.64s)]
*  I don't care how many 19 year olds you brought with you from Doge and I don't care how many fucking sofa beds you bring [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1222.14s)]
*  Into the OMB you go and you're going line by line through the fucking ledger. Like this is a vast apparatus [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1228.2s)]
*  There are but also [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1235.0s)]
*  It's the wrong ledger. You could you didn't need access to the payment system [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1236.92s)]
*  There's the federal budget that you could just go line by line [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1240.92s)]
*  But that's my point like these people have so little knowledge or respect [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1243.44s)]
*  Like I want I want to get to the danger that this poses the moral and ethical [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1247.3600000000001s)]
*  Risks that this poses but you let's just start by pointing out like this is just a stupid thing to do [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1253.72s)]
*  This is a stupid way to try to achieve what they want to achieve because it is not actually about results. It's about [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1259.88s)]
*  being the stars of a drama the drama of [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1266.48s)]
*  Reforming the government from the inside with our day beds and our Doge and our hardcore and our emails and our exciting exciting [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1270.44s)]
*  Progress and now and now and and and that to me is driving all of this not the actual practical realities of what anything [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1278.28s)]
*  They'd on their own terms what they want to do. Well, but that that's the key on their own terms [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1284.3s)]
*  It's if if what they want to do really is [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1288.72s)]
*  Cut spending in the government and that's it [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1293.1200000000001s)]
*  Then if the whole thing is really stupid and they're going about it the wrong way, but [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1296.4s)]
*  Maybe that's not what they really want to do [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1300.8400000000001s)]
*  and that's why they tried to get access to the payment system in the US government and where the shit really hits the fan is [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1302.6000000000001s)]
*  we're gonna go into a probably a debt ceiling crisis in March and [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1308.72s)]
*  When they're trying to raise the debt ceiling and Treasury already is using extraordinary measures to keep us from hitting the debt ceiling [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1313.76s)]
*  Because we should have raised it as always we're raising it late as we have for the last two decades [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1321.6000000000001s)]
*  and [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1326.16s)]
*  Treasury in that department are responsible for making sure that the US keeps paying our bills and [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1328.24s)]
*  That the you know full faith and credit of the United States government is respected and counted on all over the world [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1333.48s)]
*  It also apparently even in past financial crises or debt ceiling fights that the political staff have never [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1338.1200000000001s)]
*  Done this they've always let career civil service handle this kind of sensitive information [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1346.16s)]
*  And by the way, there was some reporting about the identities of members of the Doge team [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1350.6000000000001s)]
*  These tweens and teens running around the place [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1355.52s)]
*  And then a tween I like no, I you don't know that no, you know [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1359.32s)]
*  Now the US attorney for the District of Columbia is threatening to arrest people or prosecute people that [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1364.0s)]
*  I guess expose their identities or put them at risk in some kind of way and now you've got like Elon's [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1370.72s)]
*  Army of dipshits and losers on Twitter [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1377.1599999999999s)]
*  Now doxing the reporters who reported on the Doge staffers and in leading them getting threats [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1379.94s)]
*  So this is just an incredibly fish to stick the US attorney for DC who now who used to be? [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1385.02s)]
*  The guy who defended all the January 6 rioters. He was now made the US attorney in DC [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1391.14s)]
*  So much of this too, like it's Trump how Trump is threatening tariffs [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1396.54s)]
*  How Elon is operating? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1401.26s)]
*  Doge is all [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1403.26s)]
*  kind of [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1405.3400000000001s)]
*  childish [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1406.5800000000002s)]
*  Kind of buffoonish people [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1407.7s)]
*  drafting off the the like stability and success and institutions [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1410.78s)]
*  That they don't respect at all like Elon and this group of people [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1415.66s)]
*  They don't care or know why we make why we did things the way we did for a really long time [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1418.98s)]
*  They don't know or care why we had these independent parts of the government [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1423.74s)]
*  They don't haven't thought deeply about why it's actually a very good thing that when the Treasury says hey [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1428.1000000000001s)]
*  We have four months until we're out of money that both Democrats and Republicans that are negotiating [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1432.3600000000001s)]
*  over spending in Congress respect that and more broadly [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1435.82s)]
*  They don't respect that like yeah cutting the budget [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1439.4199999999998s)]
*  Finding waste and fraud like these are time-consuming and difficult projects that require audits and [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1444.4199999999998s)]
*  Negotiation and compromise that are slow and annoying and frustrating and imperfect like they don't respect or care about that process at all [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1449.32s)]
*  It's not hardcore [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1455.3799999999999s)]
*  It's not how they do it in business because they don't understand the value of like democratic legitimacy [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1456.02s)]
*  They don't appreciate or care about these institutions and the fact that they belong not to like Elon or Trump [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1461.62s)]
*  But they belong to us and that basic lack of respect that like humility is is is it's just absent [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1467.02s)]
*  It's absent and I know it like kind of almost goes without saying but I think it's worth saying well [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1472.9399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, because billionaire tech founders don't run their businesses like a democracy. That's the whole point [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1476.32s)]
*  They're like they're authoritarians in their own little fiefdoms and they look at the federal government and they're like, oh [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1480.86s)]
*  It's so wasteful and inefficient and why don't why can't they just run why can't the person in charge just make all the [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1486.82s)]
*  Make all the calls there too. Oh, wait a minute. We tried that we tried that the system that we have here democracy [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1492.22s)]
*  This seems I don't know about this and a lot of people thought it was stupid to do it the way we decided to try to [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1498.36s)]
*  Do it like what do you mean? You don't have one person making all the rules. Isn't that gonna be messy? Yes [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1503.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yes, but it turns out it has some perks [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1506.8999999999999s)]
*  When Besant found out about the whole thing, apparently sources told the Wall Street Journal that they have only read only access [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1509.82s)]
*  No good to the payment system and that they cannot cut off any any any payments themselves [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1515.66s)]
*  Which you know contradicts Elon's tweet where he said we are stopping these payments immediately [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1520.3400000000001s)]
*  So a little unclear what's going on knows I just who knows what's going on. It changes hour to hour. You have no idea [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1526.18s)]
*  Doge also busted into the USA ID building this weekend [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1532.22s)]
*  That's the agency responsible for humanitarian assistance around the world and they demanded access to classified information and personnel information [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1535.3400000000001s)]
*  When USA ID security officials resisted they were put on leave [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1543.06s)]
*  Elon then tweeted that USA ID is an evil criminal organization a [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1547.02s)]
*  Vipers nest of radical left Marxists who hate America and that it's time for the agency to die [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1551.34s)]
*  This was a quite a tweet spree [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1557.54s)]
*  USA IDs website and Twitter account were then taken down and [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1560.14s)]
*  Staffers were locked out of the building and their email accounts even staffers all over the world in some very dangerous places could not access [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1563.26s)]
*  USA ID [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1570.4799999999998s)]
*  Contacts their emails nothing then on Monday [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1571.84s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that USA ID would become part of the State Department and that he was now active administrator [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1575.3999999999999s)]
*  Trump also weighed in on all this insanity. Let's listen [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1581.84s)]
*  Not when it comes to fraud if there's fraud these people are lunatics and [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1590.6399999999999s)]
*  If it comes to fraud you wouldn't have an active Congress and I'm not sure that you would anyway [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1595.6399999999999s)]
*  I love the concept but they turned out to be radical left lunatics and the concept of it is good, but [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1600.84s)]
*  It's all about the people [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1607.8s)]
*  Interesting that he says he loves the concept there. I don't think you do. Of course, you do need a [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1610.24s)]
*  Law passed by Congress to completely defund and eliminate an agency [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1615.52s)]
*  Anyway, that's it's obviously not how the people who actually work at USA ID see it the way that Elon sees it [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1620.74s)]
*  We talked to Brittany Brown who was a former division head at USA ID right after she got back from her protest [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1627.18s)]
*  Outside the agency's headquarters in DC on Monday. Let's listen to Brittany. I'm Brittany Brown. I was at USA ID for four years [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1632.38s)]
*  starting [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1640.34s)]
*  You know the second week of the Biden administration and I stayed through January 20th [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1641.42s)]
*  So about 10 days ago what happened was they put a stop-work order on all US foreign assistance [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1645.9399999999998s)]
*  And that impacted about 60 billion dollars of assistance [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1653.4599999999998s)]
*  I think we've seen now in the last three days that it really is an attempt to shut down [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1657.62s)]
*  The US Agency for International Development or USA ID what is really important about this versus just like a pause on assistance [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1662.2199999999998s)]
*  Is they didn't just stop new money from going out the door [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1670.02s)]
*  The thing that's like really scary to me is the guy who is in charge of [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1673.3s)]
*  Holding together the humanitarian portion of the ceasefire with Israel in Gaza. He cannot access his email or computer [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1678.3799999999999s)]
*  He's the one who's supposed to be like actually making sure the humanitarian portion of that [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1686.3s)]
*  Is working and he can't get into his email the woman who is running the humanitarian response in Sudan [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1691.62s)]
*  Where we just declared a den a genocide [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1698.26s)]
*  She can't access her email or get into her systems to try and move money to try and move commodities so that we actually [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1700.5s)]
*  Can support the people who are now? [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1706.3s)]
*  You know without any [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1709.06s)]
*  International support these are all people that I know, you know [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1711.22s)]
*  I spent the first seven months of the first Trump administration at the Trump White House as [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1713.9s)]
*  Trump's senior Africa person and I saw firsthand that things were rarely [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1720.46s)]
*  What they said they were and that is why I feel so panicked about [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1726.98s)]
*  What they're saying versus what is happening? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1732.42s)]
*  I think this is a test to see is Congress actually going to stand up for their right [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1734.78s)]
*  And for something that the Constitution protects so USAID is a really safe organization to test this with [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1740.18s)]
*  It is difficult to explain to the average American why spending 60 billion dollars overseas [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1746.8200000000002s)]
*  Makes sense. It's not like the people in [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1753.3000000000002s)]
*  Wisconsin are concerned about what is happening necessarily in Somaliland or in Eswatini [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1756.2600000000002s)]
*  Like they're thinking about Wisconsin [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1763.0600000000002s)]
*  So it seems to me again that if President Trump and Elon Musk wanted to root out wasteful spending at USAID [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1765.3400000000001s)]
*  They could have just conducted an audit of the agency's budget and then asked their Republican controlled Congress to make a bunch of cuts [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1773.0200000000002s)]
*  Clearly, that's not what happened [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1781.8600000000001s)]
*  What Tommy what do you think's going on here and how big of a deal is this I think that this is not about [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1783.34s)]
*  Wasteful spending or even about USAID [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1788.46s)]
*  I think this is a broader effort to usurp Congress's role in the spending process and create a precedent that they can then use again [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1791.18s)]
*  and again [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1798.54s)]
*  The just to be clear the president does not have the legal authority to abolish USAID [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1799.54s)]
*  Congress established USAID's authority apart from state and merging it with state would also be unconstitutional [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1804.22s)]
*  So this is just a power grab and I think how it goes [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1810.34s)]
*  Could determine whether there is another power grab you're seeing some reporting that the Department of Education could be next [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1814.1s)]
*  That's the thing in Elon's crosshairs and it is part of a broader pattern that we're seeing in these in these first two weeks of [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1819.6999999999998s)]
*  Them ignoring or breaking the law [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1826.62s)]
*  Ignoring norms to seize power. So they fired those inspectors general at all these agencies [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1829.58s)]
*  They did it illegally by not giving Congress sufficient notice [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1834.98s)]
*  It would have been very easy to give Congress 30 days notice and then fire all these people the Republicans wouldn't stop them [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1838.74s)]
*  They wanted to have this fight and maybe take it to courts and win in court [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1843.62s)]
*  They have crippled the National Labor Relations Board by firing a member [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1847.1399999999999s)]
*  So now the NLRB doesn't have enough members to meet so they don't have a quorum [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1851.4199999999998s)]
*  That means in practice this independent agency that is supposed to investigate and prosecute labor law violations cannot do its job [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1855.74s)]
*  Similar thing happened at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or EEOC [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1863.06s)]
*  They are brow-beating Republican senators into supporting unqualified nominees. Like this is a massive [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1866.74s)]
*  unprecedented power grab and Democrats [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1873.9799999999998s)]
*  I think don't really know how to fight it or don't have the power to fight it and Republicans just refuse to [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1876.12s)]
*  And you know you said [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1882.58s)]
*  Maybe they're looking for a fight that they can take to court and win [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1885.26s)]
*  The thing that has been keeping me up at night for months is that they go to court with some of these fights and then they [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1888.66s)]
*  lose and then [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1895.02s)]
*  Donald Trump says fuck you John Roberts and the Supreme Court [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1896.82s)]
*  The Supreme Court what are you gonna do about it? [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1900.1399999999999s)]
*  And I think that this was this was corrupt and the justice who's wrong and I don't agree with them [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1902.58s)]
*  And I'm gonna do what I want. Yeah, Bob Bauer who was a White House counsel for [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1906.3s)]
*  in the Obama administration Jack Goldsmith who was a in the White House counsel for [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1912.46s)]
*  Republican administration they both wrote this and and they said that Russ vote who's gonna head up OMB like his view of [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1918.58s)]
*  the Constitution is is that you should try to [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1926.34s)]
*  Push the court and maybe defy court orders because you want or you want the court to give you favorable [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1929.74s)]
*  favorable rulings because the court is afraid that if the court gives you gives Donald Trump like rulings that he doesn't like then [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1935.1399999999999s)]
*  He'll say fuck you and then that'll be it, right? [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1943.42s)]
*  The court needs to balance its constitutional prerogative with the fear that Trump will break the rules and so they negotiate [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1946.98s)]
*  They negotiate against themselves [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1952.46s)]
*  Allowing Trump to be unconstrained without him ever having to break a rule by the way not dissimilar to what [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1954.74s)]
*  News agencies are doing when they capitulate to Trump on lawsuits that they're afraid to fight all the way to the Supreme Court [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1959.54s)]
*  There are two pieces of it. I think are worth splitting up [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1965.18s)]
*  One is what they're doing around these firings or the National Labor Relations Board [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1967.9s)]
*  In which they are basically asserting that any bounds on Trump and his ability to decide who works for him and where in the executive branch are unconstitutional [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1972.22s)]
*  Which is not a theory that Donald Trump invented is called the unitary executive theory [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1979.22s)]
*  It it it precedes him and it is the way in which Trump's instinctive strongman politics [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1985.94s)]
*  merge with the Republican desire for an imperial presidency incredibly dangerous in part because that [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1990.8600000000001s)]
*  ideological desire for an extremely powerful presidency is not just [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=1996.78s)]
*  In what Republicans in Congress want or what previous Republican presidents want it's what Republican courts seem willing to go along with [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2002.3s)]
*  the other part of this is the power of the purse whether it is because they didn't want to have the fight on this issue or [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2008.46s)]
*  They do think they would be constrained by a court ruling that they withdrew the federal funding freeze [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2016.98s)]
*  We're willing to kind of give on that right it points to the places in which they're still [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2021.38s)]
*  Responding to kind of the old rules at least a little bit at least that's maybe a glimmer of hope that they are [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2026.14s)]
*  My one of the federal judges that that you know tried to freeze [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2031.6599999999999s)]
*  freeze and [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2036.26s)]
*  And issued a restraining order said just today Monday that [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2037.74s)]
*  She doesn't believe that the Trump administration is abiding by the restraining order and order them [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2042.6599999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah, it ordered them again to stop the freeze [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2049.2599999999998s)]
*  It also sounds like that OPM letter went through Elon shop and did not go by people like Stephen Miller and other top White House officials [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2052.82s)]
*  I'm sure there's some intra administration. There's well there's and they're just they're benefiting from chaos and incompetence, right like you Cassidy [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2059.74s)]
*  Bill Cassidy Republican senator put out a letter today saying pep far still seems to be on hold [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2067.9799999999996s)]
*  Just pep far was a Bush initiative Republican initiative to spend vast amounts of money to combat [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2072.3799999999997s)]
*  HIV and AIDS in Africa [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2078.62s)]
*  I remember when this was a debate at the time [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2080.3799999999997s)]
*  Bush didn't like USAID and so he set it up separately because he wanted it to run through the State Department because of the [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2082.9799999999996s)]
*  previous Republican [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2089.46s)]
*  Problems with USAID that's still being held even though they're claiming that these things have a waiver but on the power of the purse [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2090.98s)]
*  What Trump is doing here is he's basically saying I? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2098.1s)]
*  have the latitude to turn off everything and then by no bless oblige turn it back on right and [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2101.9s)]
*  We have spent a long time watching as the presidency kind of encroached upon [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2109.14s)]
*  Congress's prerogatives like that's something that was happening under Democrats and [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2114.3s)]
*  Republicans and it's gotten complicated and [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2117.86s)]
*  When Obama is president a bunch of Democrats are defending certain things that now we would not defend and Republicans are doing the same in a Republican [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2120.0600000000004s)]
*  Administrations, but this is as basic and core to the Constitution as it gets if the president can decide [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2125.86s)]
*  What to spend or not to spend based on what Congress has passed the Congress is no longer [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2131.98s)]
*  Determining how the money is spent the president is that is one of the core dangers [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2136.7000000000003s)]
*  that is one of the core reasons we have a constitution and [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2141.38s)]
*  I [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2144.1800000000003s)]
*  Agree with you like my concern too is that they're gonna obliterate that they're gonna the bash through a court ruling at some point [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2145.1s)]
*  I think the question is like how long do we hold that off right four years ago? [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2150.7400000000002s)]
*  What Elon Musk is doing impossible to imagine eight years ago impossible to imagine four years from now. I have no idea [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2153.78s)]
*  It's also important that like this isn't just about you know norms and institutions and theories of government and all that which is [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2159.86s)]
*  Incredible dangerous threats to this is to the system of democracy [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2167.5s)]
*  But like this is just causing needless suffering and death because again if they and you know [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2170.8199999999997s)]
*  What they're gonna do is they're gonna I'm sure come out with you know programs and spending at USAID [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2176.98s)]
*  That seem ridiculous or wasteful there. Yeah, again. There's probably plenty of that, right and [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2182.7799999999997s)]
*  No one is saying we shouldn't go through the federal budget and go through the federal government and eliminate wasteful spending [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2188.2599999999998s)]
*  And try to find more efficiencies but pausing it the way they did cutting it off immediately like people [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2195.46s)]
*  Children what children are gonna die because they can't get the medication they need in other countries for what for nothing [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2202.42s)]
*  We're not gonna save money for this you heard from Brittany. This is money that was already out the door [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2209.14s)]
*  This isn't new money, so they're no one's saving [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2212.8199999999997s)]
*  This is just it's just you know there's I think there was guards prison guards that were guarding [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2214.7799999999997s)]
*  Isis prisoners that just had to walk off the job [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2218.94s)]
*  Well, they weren't they didn't know if they should show up for work [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2222.1s)]
*  So some of them didn't there's there's USAID people in dangerous areas around the world that now can't get access to [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2224.02s)]
*  To help if they need it [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2230.78s)]
*  All kinds of health, you know programs were funding around the world that are just gonna just lead to more suffering and death [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2232.66s)]
*  I mean, it's fucking ridiculous. It's inexcusable [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2237.98s)]
*  I also think like there's this lack of clarity now about whether some parts of USAID funding has been unfrozen [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2239.98s)]
*  Like Rubio said that secretary Rubio said that life-saving assistance like medicine medical service food and shelter would be exempted from the [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2246.46s)]
*  Aide-freeze, but no one really knows what that means [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2254.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2256.54s)]
*  and I think that's kind of the point because this uncertainty has just upended everything USAID is doing and [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2256.98s)]
*  And I think honestly I think talking about this as a freeze is probably a mistake [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2263.5s)]
*  I have zero confidence that the vast majority of this funding or these programs will be turned back on [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2267.66s)]
*  And I think that well, by the way Rubio used to be a big defender of USAID funding [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2274.78s)]
*  He said it was critical for our national security [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2279.34s)]
*  And I was totally flip-flopped [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2281.1400000000003s)]
*  But let's just say that something you're working on is paused for 90 days [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2282.38s)]
*  If you're a contractor working for USAID and like Kenya or Ukraine or Southeast Asia [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2286.7000000000003s)]
*  You don't have 90 days worth of savings to just sit on to like see if your job [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2291.54s)]
*  Is around in three months like you're gonna go do something else and it's going to [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2296.42s)]
*  Like completely cripple all this work that that you know [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2300.94s)]
*  It's taken decades to set up this infrastructure these contracts or these networks of people in these countries and to your point [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2304.46s)]
*  I mean if you're getting entry retrovirals through PEPFAR and you stop you're gonna die [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2310.02s)]
*  And again like how it is and I and I get the domestic politics on all this [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2316.42s)]
*  I get that no one likes foreign aid or not a lot most Americans don't like foreign aid and you tell people it's like [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2320.54s)]
*  0.7% of the whole budget and that still doesn't matter they think it's 10% is the big problem [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2327.18s)]
*  Yeah, that is a big problem, but I do think if you I think for most Americans you tell them hey [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2331.34s)]
*  This kid showed up at a clinic today [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2336.54s)]
*  Like they have every day for you know once a month to go get some medicine and now it shut down [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2338.58s)]
*  And now this kid could die like for what when what for what purpose so that Elon can post about like vile [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2343.14s)]
*  communists Marxists there's like a way in which they're kind of base [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2350.86s)]
*  Incompetence and then they're kind of like viciousness work together here [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2356.06s)]
*  Which is they didn't know or care very much about what USAID did [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2359.98s)]
*  They didn't care very much or know very much about what PEPFAR did before they have an ideological [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2364.1s)]
*  Set of assumptions about about non about nonprofit work about foreign aid that it's all bullshit right they like internalized a bunch of that [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2368.46s)]
*  But I wonder if you if Elon Musk knew that USAID played such a big role in fighting apartheid in South Africa [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2375.58s)]
*  well, I mean [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2382.06s)]
*  Just the point that I'm only making is that like the way in which these things work together is they're so fucking careless [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2384.46s)]
*  They're so and like they're just careless people. It's so it's a it's a glib [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2389.58s)]
*  Carelessness that is just like it's beneath contempt and the stakes are so high. We're just yes [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2395.1s)]
*  There are many ideological kind of warriors [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2401.22s)]
*  But a lot of the people at the top of this are just capricious glib fools that don't [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2404.2999999999997s)]
*  Understand that they just don't care that they're playing with matches [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2410.5s)]
*  But in some instances it's worse than that. It's it's they are folding this into their preconceived [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2413.7400000000002s)]
*  Ideological anger and they've decided that USAID [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2419.7400000000002s)]
*  funded programs that led to [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2424.0200000000004s)]
*  Gain-of-function research that led to kovat, you know, this is all kind of getting folded into like [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2426.82s)]
*  prosecute Fauci [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2432.42s)]
*  Madness and it's like, you know, the Elon Musk retweeting at Wall Street apes, which is his source on [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2434.1400000000003s)]
*  Someone found some 40 million in taxpayer funding that went to some scientists in Wuhan and it's just like I don't know [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2441.1000000000004s)]
*  Apparently this is all just part of a conspiracy theory about how the lab leak was on purpose from you know [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2447.7000000000003s)]
*  Thanks to Fauci's funding from USAID. I guess that's the new theory the case here [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2454.82s)]
*  and again, you have the richest man in the world with [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2459.94s)]
*  One of the biggest platforms now one of the most powerful people in government just accusing [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2463.46s)]
*  Entire organizations of being criminal enterprises and you can see the slippery slope, right? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2468.22s)]
*  Like you can see where now, you know, Pam Bondi and cash Patel get in there and they start processing [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2473.58s)]
*  Well, this is criminal activity. We're gonna investigate it. Like this is this is how it goes [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2478.58s)]
*  Unless anyone think this is just about foreign aid the Trump administration also [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2483.14s)]
*  pushed out the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Ro Hit Chopra in order the agency to stop all [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2487.06s)]
*  Investigations and enforcement actions against banks and payday lenders and credit card companies [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2493.42s)]
*  They have saved just consumers billions and billions and billions of dollars in refunds and they've got this consumers [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2499.18s)]
*  It's a great this is indefensible [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2507.28s)]
*  There is no simpler like the Delta between what Republicans claim that CFPB is and what CFPB is that is one of the biggest and [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2509.28s)]
*  Starkest gaps in politics is an agency that has such a singular simple purpose [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2516.8199999999997s)]
*  Which is to go after big corporations that are defrauding and fucking over consumers and getting the money back [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2522.1s)]
*  It is being punished because it well is being punished apart because it was originally Elizabeth Warren's idea [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2528.62s)]
*  That's its original sin, but it is so fucking effective. It is such good government [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2532.8999999999996s)]
*  They they they put they put Mick Mulvaney in there the first term to try to destroy it [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2537.8999999999996s)]
*  Biden was able to put in Rohit who did an amazing job and now they're gonna try to destroy it again [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2543.06s)]
*  Yeah, and as Tommy mentioned Wall Street Journal reports and now the Washington Post the Trump and Elon are [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2547.1s)]
*  Preparing an executive order to try to shut down the entire Department of Education [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2553.7s)]
*  This was the campaign promise from Trump. They acknowledge in the order that they can't shut the entire thing down by [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2557.5s)]
*  Executive order they want to go to Congress to do it [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2563.94s)]
*  But they want to move some of the functions out of the Department of Education, of course, you know, most schools are funded by [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2565.8199999999997s)]
*  Local and state taxes, but you know for poor schools get a lot of title one funding from the Department of Education [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2571.5800000000004s)]
*  All of student financial aid the federal financial aid program is run out of the Department of Education [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2577.9s)]
*  Students with disabilities are funded through the Department of Education. It goes on and on and on [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2582.5400000000004s)]
*  The New York Times reports that more than 8,000 federal government web pages have been taken down including thousands of research papers that were available [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2588.0600000000004s)]
*  on the CDC website [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2595.5400000000004s)]
*  Informational IRS videos about how to avoid tax penalties and the state-level hate crimes data on the Justice Department website [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2597.58s)]
*  Speaking of which there is an ongoing purge at the DOJ and FBI Trump is firing any [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2603.82s)]
*  Prosecutors or FBI agents that had anything to do with any of the criminal investigations that led to his indictments [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2608.9s)]
*  Well in fairness, that's because they were also incredibly ineffective [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2615.02s)]
*  Gotta get some good prosecutors in that can get a fucking conviction and get them get them in jail at the FBI [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2618.38s)]
*  Employees were given until 3 p.m [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2623.3399999999997s)]
*  Eastern time on Monday to fill out a questionnaire about whether they were involved in any way in [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2624.98s)]
*  Investigations into January 6th. I did that's a funny trap to sit for prosecutors like hmm [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2631.3799999999997s)]
*  Should I fire you why or n? [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2636.58s)]
*  You know, the FBI has estimated that the number of people who were agents and staff could be about 6,000 [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2638.58s)]
*  This comes after DOJ fired about 12 prosecutors in DC who had been brought on to investigate January 6th cases [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2644.66s)]
*  And most of those 6,000 are like so tangential [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2651.48s)]
*  Yes [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2654.2s)]
*  People who got random leads who passed along information or were part of a wiretap or God knows what and by the way [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2654.7s)]
*  That's the real concern is that so many of these people working or like career officials who've been at DOJ or the FBI [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2660.16s)]
*  For a decade some of them have our very senior people with like [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2667.7999999999997s)]
*  Counterintelligence experience and they're going after national security threats and they've been working all these cases and now [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2671.2799999999997s)]
*  They're just gonna be gone or they were just assigned a case and they don't have a you don't have a choice [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2676.8399999999997s)]
*  right season prosecutors who do their season process season prosecutors who have [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2680.7999999999997s)]
*  No reason to be fired and it's not as though America's short on white-collar crimes to prosecute. So [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2686.0s)]
*  It's fucking terrible. So I mean you talked about the unitary executive theory, you know, JD Vance tweeted today [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2691.68s)]
*  You know look [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2699.08s)]
*  unelected bureaucrats [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2700.56s)]
*  Should not be [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2702.6s)]
*  Resisting the president states they work for him [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2704.28s)]
*  He gets to staff his government with who he wants and then he is answerable to the people [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2706.6400000000003s)]
*  So the people elected Trump and Trump gets to have the entire government he wants so everyone else should just shut the fuck up [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2711.26s)]
*  Basically, why is that wrong? [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2716.8s)]
*  You know, I was thinking about this earlier, which is this that [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2719.52s)]
*  We are watching these guys make these kind of simple arguments against these like hard-won [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2723.0800000000004s)]
*  institutional [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2730.4s)]
*  Protections right some of which are imposed by Congress. Some are just norms that evolved over decades if not centuries and a lot of those [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2732.24s)]
*  norms institutions [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2740.8399999999997s)]
*  Processes that are designed to constrain the executive [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2742.9199999999996s)]
*  Were put in place in the kind of like long before the internet and they were put in place [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2746.12s)]
*  When you had a kind of like elite [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2752.12s)]
*  bipartisan [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2755.3999999999996s)]
*  set of actors [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2756.9599999999996s)]
*  That didn't feel like they had that that that kind of established this order [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2758.56s)]
*  Long ago and and it's sort of been in place in a way that was like never really defended, right? [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2763.36s)]
*  We took no one really making the argument for [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2768.0s)]
*  Why the DOJ is separate from the presidency and why that's a good idea and why that's important [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2770.56s)]
*  There's no real there hasn't been a real kind of I don't know like legal [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2776.04s)]
*  broad-based kind of public legal argument against originalism and like kind of the values of the kind of what we've learned about [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2780.32s)]
*  Constitutional governments of governance over the last 200 years [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2786.44s)]
*  but what we do have is just [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2789.76s)]
*  Example after example after example of why we put these [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2792.96s)]
*  Restrictions in place and they were meant to stop presidents from abusing power [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2796.48s)]
*  The reason we have bureaucrats who are not accountable to the president can't be fired by the president is because of the spoil system [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2800.7200000000003s)]
*  And because when the government was filled with cronies, it didn't fucking work and it was a corrupt bargain [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2806.36s)]
*  Why is the DOJ separate from the White House? [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2810.32s)]
*  Because the presidency is too powerful and when the DOJ isn't separate from the White House, it means the president is not [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2812.52s)]
*  Accountable to law there's an answer to everyone one of these questions [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2818.28s)]
*  But you know, it's like we're there [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2821.4s)]
*  They're relying on the fact that we're like fighting these guys in every fucking front and they can just spout off and say make these [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2823.44s)]
*  Sort of claims to the power of the people. Well, we're left kind of following behind. Well, actually there's a good reason [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2828.76s)]
*  You know, our key RFK was actually a attorney general [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2833.36s)]
*  I'm so sick of this. This is what people voted for line like no no one voted to give Elon Musk [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2836.16s)]
*  a line item veto for the entire federal government and like [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=2841.8799999999997s)]

*  But I don't know I would focus on the Elon piece right now and just go go hard [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3417.6200000000003s)]
*  So Bernie Sanders put out a video over the weekend that I really liked [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3422.06s)]
*  it was it was it was it was just it was everything you want out of [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3427.58s)]
*  Bernie Sanders and I think like speaks to his sort of [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3433.9s)]
*  Moral leadership he just it's just a camera. It's a very dangerous time [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3436.86s)]
*  There are three things we got to do one [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3440.42s)]
*  We got to accurately describe what's happening to we need to find the short term and through we need to find the long term [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3442.14s)]
*  And in the short term, I think he was talking about what Tommy was talking about [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3445.54s)]
*  I think there's and the importance of fighting Trump wherever we can [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3448.14s)]
*  Ezra [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3453.94s)]
*  Klein made this point [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3454.7799999999997s)]
*  About sort of also just not taking Trump at his at his word, right? [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3456.58s)]
*  Like when he claims certain authorities, we shouldn't concede to it Trump today [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3461.14s)]
*  He's trying to be scary and powerful. Yeah, he wants he wants everyone to see him as a strong man [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3464.86s)]
*  Trump today announced a sovereign wealth fund. He can't do that. He does not have the authority to create a sovereign wealth fund and we shouldn't [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3468.6200000000003s)]
*  Lend him we shouldn't do what we're afraid that what legacy media companies are doing or what? [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3474.6200000000003s)]
*  Judges might be doing which is because we assume Trump will break the rules to not uphold the rules, right? [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3479.94s)]
*  We should just uphold the rules [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3484.94s)]
*  and [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3486.82s)]
*  And then three what Bernie talked about was building this [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3488.7400000000002s)]
*  Long-term political power and making an argument for a positive vision and [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3491.58s)]
*  Look, I don't think it's revelatory [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3496.5s)]
*  But just the the kind of clean simple to the point directly talked about it [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3498.02s)]
*  How serious this moment is how dangerous it is without hydrogen without kind of theatrics, but just to camera explaining it [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3502.1s)]
*  I thought was really powerful. I [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3509.7s)]
*  Along with you guys have yelled about Democrats needing to do more on this very show [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3513.9s)]
*  We haven't quite found our footing just yet, but I do think just seeing a lot of people on [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3519.26s)]
*  Twitter and blue sky. I'm gonna check the skeets to these days [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3525.54s)]
*  I do over the weekend. There's just there's a lot of anger at the elected Democrats [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3529.58s)]
*  And I just I think we should level set on what how much power Democrats have right now, which is almost none and [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3536.34s)]
*  That is just a consequence of the election [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3543.66s)]
*  And [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3545.66s)]
*  That is just a consequence of the election and we probably have less power now as a party than we have anytime I can remember [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3546.8199999999997s)]
*  Because Trump's got the courts. He's got the executive branch. He's got billionaires all around them [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3553.58s)]
*  they all own media platforms like they have Congress they have a lot of power and [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3559.46s)]
*  Democrats can yell and scream and [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3565.42s)]
*  You know Tommy I had the same thought about the USAID press conference [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3568.02s)]
*  Because of the politics but then I thought I'd thinking to myself, you know what we told them to go fight [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3572.52s)]
*  They're out there fighting. It's it's it's an elections not in a couple months like let them do it for today [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3577.4s)]
*  You know, they'll get used to it and then maybe they'll go to the Department of Education next [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3583.56s)]
*  Maybe they'll go to the consumer financial protection bureau next and they'll find more politically popular things to yell about but I'm glad to see them [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3586.6800000000003s)]
*  Do it and you know shots is gonna hold up these nominees [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3593.8s)]
*  But everyone should realize with that too like that's gonna eat up a lot of floor time and it's gonna slow things down [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3599.0s)]
*  Which is great, but John Thune is gonna be able to get those nominees through like Democrats [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3603.72s)]
*  Don't have the power we have the power to slow things down in Congress [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3609.4s)]
*  We don't have the power to stop a lot of things. We just don't and I think everyone should realize that and you know as we [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3612.32s)]
*  criticize Democrats [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3619.0s)]
*  rightly for a lame tweet here or a lame speech there or whatever else we should just know that you know [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3621.0s)]
*  Everyone should be suing the Trump administration on everything the Democratic AG should be out there [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3627.12s)]
*  We should take them to court on everything. That's a lever that we can pull we can do everything [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3631.3199999999997s)]
*  I do think like we were gonna have some leverage on funding and the debt ceiling because [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3635.2799999999997s)]
*  Mike Johnson is going to need Democratic votes on those things [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3640.92s)]
*  They're not gonna be able to get chip Roy and all the Republicans to get together and vote to raise the debt ceiling you vote [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3643.74s)]
*  To this so like that is a choke point for us [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3649.2599999999998s)]
*  But there's not a lot more. There's just not a lot more. We have to win it [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3651.92s)]
*  We have to win elections again guys [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3654.92s)]
*  Yeah, the part that I'm like a questioning that I find myself like feeling like unsure about is [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3656.08s)]
*  you know [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3662.64s)]
*  Don't get distracted by USAID. We got to talk about the impact of terrorists and don't get distracted by the impact of terrorists [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3664.6s)]
*  we've got to talk about the oligarchs and don't talk about the oligarchs who's got to talk about the price of eggs and [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3669.96s)]
*  I like I then and then I turn on [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3674.76s)]
*  The television and there's Trump every day for a couple hours a day [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3679.2400000000002s)]
*  Just hitting whatever he's gonna gonna talking about it all talking about it all and you know [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3682.2400000000002s)]
*  Trump declared that he was gonna create a sovereign wealth fund. I mentioned right it is not is barely news. It's barely news [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3687.56s)]
*  It's a big fucking deal. It's a big deal that the Trump had idea [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3693.76s)]
*  Well, I think it's a bad idea to have a to have Trump [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3697.18s)]
*  Have Trump basically creates a kind of an administrative led investment vehicle [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3701.6s)]
*  I don't want him to have a slush friend, but the United States having a sovereign wealth funds like it's worth [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3706.76s)]
*  It's a conversation worth having how else are we gonna buy our Chinese spyware? That's right [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3710.64s)]
*  Well, I don't listen [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3715.4s)]
*  I would rather put the money back in the hands of the American people but that's just me but the but but like all [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3717.3199999999997s)]
*  It's a way of saying like maybe maybe even that is kind of over thing at this point like fight everything everywhere [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3721.48s)]
*  Right you want to fight USAID fight USAID take some reps [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3726.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, just get out there and get out there and take some reps and you know [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3729.16s)]
*  I want them to show passion [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3732.12s)]
*  it was because like a lot of people were making fun of Chuck Schumer because he had this series of tweets over the [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3733.16s)]
*  weekend where he was like [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3737.52s)]
*  You're gonna watch the Super Bowl next next weekend and beer is gonna be more expensive [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3738.86s)]
*  You're gonna be trying to buy avocados and those are gonna be more expensive and like those were his tweets [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3743.34s)]
*  Everyone's like there's a fucking emergency Elan's breaking into USAID. What are you doing? And I'm like, yeah Chuck Schumer's [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3747.7000000000003s)]
*  Tweets are dumb. There's an expectations management problem, but it's like but if Chuck Schumer's tweets were amazing [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3754.6600000000003s)]
*  What would that have done? [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3760.02s)]
*  Where Schumer gave friends companies like I've never seen people more aroused than they are right now and everyone's like, ah, no [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3761.54s)]
*  He's saying they're aroused. It's like who cares? That's how Chuck Schumer talks. What's the difference? [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3767.06s)]
*  We played that on putt save America was really funny. Yeah, I think we can critique it [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3770.36s)]
*  We can make fun of that [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3774.42s)]
*  But it's just sort of like arousal [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3775.82s)]
*  They're also not gonna become different people Chuck Schumer is gonna be a [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3777.52s)]
*  Senior citizen Jewish New Yorker out there talking about whatever he's gonna talk about the way he's been talking about for 50 fucking years [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3780.82s)]
*  We need them to look they need to step up like a good to do a press conference today. They've been slow [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3785.9s)]
*  There's all these reports of like the Democrats [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3790.84s)]
*  The congressional Democrats doing a conference call to figure out their response as the news changes [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3793.62s)]
*  If right as the OPM memo gets rescinded whatever it's like be a little more nimble. Yeah, take some shots [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3798.62s)]
*  Don't worry about though the words being perfect. Make sure you try to get it to the people who need to hear it [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3804.1s)]
*  Maybe don't use the word aroused [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3808.9s)]
*  Maybe don't defend the most unpopular spending we do and defense some of the popular spending but look yeah points for fighting [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3811.7799999999997s)]
*  I guess yeah agree. Yeah, I totally agree with all that and I just I just want everyone to know like there is [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3818.48s)]
*  Even if the Democratic Party was perfect and fucking nailed it every single day [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3823.58s)]
*  there is a limit to what we can stop right now because we fucking lost the election and [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3828.8599999999997s)]
*  We're gonna and you know, but I said this because there's even people like oh now Democrats [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3835.02s)]
*  They're just gonna tell us to vote for them in 2026. Yeah. Yeah, we are because that's the only way to [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3839.14s)]
*  To stop legislation from happening. I took Twitter off my phone again. I think it was good. I [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3844.42s)]
*  Think it's good not to have that on my phone [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3850.02s)]
*  Yeah, you don't want to get into the skeets and I'm not I can't I can't do it [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3852.06s)]
*  I can't I can't take it anymore. I do think everyone really needs to keep an eye on these media [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3855.5s)]
*  Lawsuit settlements with Trump. Yes, it's not just ABC and their defamation suit [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3860.48s)]
*  It's not just Facebook and their 25 million dollar you call it whatever you want to Trump and to his library [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3865.46s)]
*  There's reports at CBS might settle a suit [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3872.1s)]
*  They just fucking crazy the most ridiculous 60 minutes interview with Kamala Harris that they edited like every news organization [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3875.58s)]
*  Edits everything always and Paramount might settle that and by the way [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3882.14s)]
*  They happen to have Paramount Skydance merger that's sitting before the Trump administration [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3886.54s)]
*  But suggesting that those things are connected would be untoward. So I wouldn't do that [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3891.34s)]
*  It's like Larry Ellison just in the what in the early in the office just for you just happened to be there [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3895.02s)]
*  Yeah, so if we see the biggest media [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3900.02s)]
*  organizations in the country [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3902.42s)]
*  And their corporate overlords [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3904.62s)]
*  Preemptively caving to the Trump administration and settling lawsuits. They could have won that is a very scary signal about [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3907.22s)]
*  press coverage and [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3914.62s)]
*  Fighting for the First Amendment right to cover the White House in the second administration and we need to keep an eye on that [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3916.38s)]
*  Well, it's like you talk you talk about like, you know, we need you need to be nimble [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3922.06s)]
*  We need to be out there like me here. Well, there's that but then it's also like [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3925.2599999999998s)]
*  Journalists themselves are struggling to cover all this and so now you have the president States [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3929.2599999999998s)]
*  Who is lying and making shit up and [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3934.38s)]

*  And if anybody covering him slips up for even one fucking second [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3943.06s)]
*  He's gonna be the president suing these people into oblivion while they're where they're where their parent companies have business for the government [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3946.38s)]
*  It's it's terrifying. Yeah, the media point is really important also because sometimes I feel like all of us are having [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3952.02s)]
*  you know, there's like a [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3958.78s)]
*  100,000 of us that are all having a conversation about strategy with each other and then there's like a country of 300 million people [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3960.82s)]
*  Most of whom are who are paying attention and can barely get some of this [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3966.78s)]
*  Information from new sources that are now under intense pressure [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3971.6600000000003s)]
*  And so like one of the things we all have to think about is not just making sure that our other [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3975.1400000000003s)]
*  Tweeters and other Democrats are saying the exact right message [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3979.7000000000003s)]
*  But like, you know getting it out there to more people gotta put some kind of message at the bottom of the Costco samples [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3982.46s)]
*  I [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3987.52s)]
*  Gotta get creative people the we can't and we can't shop at Costco [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3988.88s)]
*  Yeah, we can still go to Costco gotta get messages those rotisserie chickens [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3991.92s)]
*  Get the messages to the chickens [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=3995.2799999999997s)]
*  We've dealt this guy for a decade and Trump's like we gave 50 million dollars to Hamas for condoms [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4000.2s)]
*  And then they use the condoms as bombs. It's completely made up because some dork over at Doge [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4006.8399999999997s)]

*  69 420 misread a spreadsheet and didn't realize this funding was going like Mozambique or something and then the response though is like fact [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4015.92s)]
*  Checked order org has Trump administration makes unsupported claims about 50 million for condoms to Gaza [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4023.24s)]
*  It's like oh my god, and then we're done and then we're like what's breaking through? [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4028.24s)]
*  None of this is breaking through and then I listened to Sarah Longwell's condoms [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4032.08s)]
*  I'm breaking through then I listen to Sarah Longwell's [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4035.64s)]
*  Sarah Longwell's focus group this weekend and she's got first-time Trump voters Biden to Trump voters [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4039.16s)]
*  Asking them how they're thinking about Trump and they're like Tommy said earlier like they're all always taking an action on stuff taking action [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4044.24s)]
*  And then like he promised Hamas is raw doggy [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4049.96s)]
*  Promise made promise kept [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4055.4s)]
*  No, one of them is one of the people he's like I haven't heard much [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4057.44s)]
*  But I heard about these condoms that they're spending he's like I'm glad they're cutting all that the condoms [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4061.22s)]
*  For Hamas that's crazy. I'm like, oh that fucking broke through course that broke through course it did [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4065.64s)]
*  Anyway, we got a lot of work and to Twitter's the cesspool that the Elon fluffers are out in force. They're everywhere [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4072.24s)]

*  No, I know I know you know a lot about the federal government you fucking asshole [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4083.2999999999997s)]
*  Deleted the app to download the New York Times cooking app instead [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4086.56s)]

*  You're making it with ingredients no tariffs. That's right. Thank you. Mr. Trump. Thank you. Mr [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4094.52s)]
*  Trump all right when we come back love it talks to the deputy director of the OMB in the Obama administration and director of the [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4099.36s)]
*  National Economic Council under Joe Biden [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4104.92s)]
*  Brian Deese and just so you all know we talked in between the Mexican tariffs being paused and the Canadian tariffs being paused [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4107.12s)]
*  But we talked about it both as a negotiating tactic and what it might look like if these tariffs are ultimately [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4114.32s)]
*  Implemented including the the Chinese tariffs which as of this recording are still we believe going into effect [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4120.8s)]
*  Joining us today for a quick and dirty breakdown of Trump's trade war [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4126.28s)]
*  He's the former deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget and director of the National Economic Council under President Biden [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4129.92s)]
*  Brian Deese welcome back to the pod [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4136.12s)]
*  Thanks for having me as of this recording Monday afternoon [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4137.72s)]
*  25% tariffs are set to go into effect against a broad range of Canadian imports with the exception of a 10% tariff on [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4140.96s)]
*  Canadian oil though there are last-minute negotiations that could push this off another month that will also be a 10% tariff on Chinese imports [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4146.68s)]
*  Trump and Mexican president Claudia Scheinbaum [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4154.64s)]
*  Negotiated a deal to delay terrorists by at least a month against Mexico with Mexico promising to send more troops at southern border and [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4156.84s)]
*  Scheinbaum securing some sort of a promise over guns flowing south from the United States into Mexico. Let's start with this [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4162.4400000000005s)]
*  I woke up this morning and I just opened my phone and I just checked the Dow [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4168.96s)]
*  I don't I don't live my life yoked to what the Dow does [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4175.24s)]
*  But I was like are we in an economic crisis or not? [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4177.92s)]
*  and what I saw was that the markets dipped a little bit and then upon the news that [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4180.68s)]
*  Trump had this deal with Scheinbaum. They went back up [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4185.56s)]
*  Does that tell you that there is still a kind of belief that Trump is just negotiating that even as we're recording this? [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4189.04s)]
*  He's threatening these massive and terrible tariffs, but is ultimately just in some way negotiating [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4195.400000000001s)]
*  Look I think a lot of the market reaction can be explained by exactly that which is [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4200.48s)]
*  initially the market thought he wasn't serious and he wouldn't do this and then the market thought well he will [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4204.64s)]
*  Threaten these tariffs, but he won't actually put them into effect [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4210.6s)]
*  And now I think there is still a belief that he may put them into effect [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4213.08s)]
*  But there will only be an effect for a short period of time because this is negotiating [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4216.32s)]
*  All of that is to say though the right way to think about the impact is not what happens to the Dow today [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4220.4s)]
*  It's what happens to the prices that people pay on typical things for no apparent reason [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4226.400000000001s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal called this the dumbest trade war in history [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4233.2s)]
*  It's one of the few times I think that the Wall Street Journal actually understated it [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4236.08s)]
*  This is all self-imposed and so even if the impact is only for a short period of time or only muted [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4239.72s)]
*  We're still the end result is people are paying more for no apparent reason [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4246.72s)]
*  So let's talk about what the impact could be again these tariffs against Canada may go in effect tomorrow [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4251.34s)]
*  They may not but if they did some estimates found that they could cost a typical household about [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4258.02s)]
*  $2,600 but that's an average. It'll affect certain goods more than other goods and because of the unique [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4263.22s)]
*  Interdependence of Canada in the United States. It would affect some parts of the country more than others. What do you think though? [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4270.5s)]
*  There I want to just divide it half first [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4275.54s)]
*  What would be the biggest price impacts and then I want to talk about the broader economic impact sure so start the price impacts on [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4277.62s)]
*  the the goods that we rely most on a candidate in Mexico for so [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4283.54s)]
*  fruits and vegetables [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4290.62s)]
*  Super Bowl time avocados [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4292.3s)]
*  Most of our fruits and vegetables we import from Mexico. The price of those things is going to go up by about 25% [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4294.38s)]
*  Gas at the pump there are certain regions of the country particularly the Midwest that rely on [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4301.38s)]
*  Imported petroleum products from Canada most estimates are that you'd see a 50 cent increase in gas in the Midwest [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4306.099999999999s)]
*  Probably more like 25 cents across the country, but it could be it could be higher in particular places [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4312.98s)]
*  And then the kind of typical [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4319.0599999999995s)]
*  Goods that you see walking down a target aisle or a Walmart aisle. So iPhones [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4321.9s)]
*  toasters [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4327.94s)]
*  consumer electronics are all going to go up by in the ballpark of [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4328.98s)]
*  25% because when a tariff is applied [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4333.780000000001s)]
*  It's not just that the importer pays the tariff [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4336.14s)]
*  It's that the competitors then raise their prices to to match those and so the consumer ends up paying [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4338.5s)]
*  Most of that so in terms of practical and practically most of what you buy if you're walking down the grocery store [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4344.5s)]
*  Or you're walking through a target or Walmart the prices are going to go up. The first order impact is [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4351.1s)]
*  Typical consumers pay more on things like groceries and gas and consumer electronics [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4357.18s)]
*  The second order impact is if that actually gets washed away by a stronger dollar then it hurts American [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4362.0199999999995s)]
*  Manufacturers, which is why I saw I saw a cartoon trying to say what is Trump actually doing? [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4369.94s)]
*  where Trump was pissing into a fan and it was spitting all back into his face and [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4375.66s)]
*  Usually that's sort of evocative [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4380.86s)]
*  But actually I think that's not an unreasonable way of thinking about what's going on here [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4382.74s)]
*  It's hard to avoid this coming back in and being self-defeating in some way or shape or form [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4386.74s)]
*  So then what could be the job impact? So that's the kind of the consumer price [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4391.74s)]
*  Impact but there's a lot of interdependence between so some of the goods that could be tariffs are products that are brought down [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4396.179999999999s)]
*  Into the US to be part of domestic manufacturing here. Who are people what jobs are at risk? [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4402.0199999999995s)]
*  Because of this of these tariffs with the place I'm most worried about is the auto industry [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4407.58s)]
*  Because the auto industry is incredibly dependent on the inner relationship with Canada and Mexico a [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4412.18s)]
*  lot of the the the parts that go into making a car are [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4420.18s)]
*  Produced in Canada and they go back and forth over the border anyone who lives in Michigan or has been up in Detroit the Windsor [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4424.42s)]
*  Bridge, you know [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4429.82s)]
*  The the our auto industry is essentially one industry that operates across a border [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4430.62s)]
*  So to build a you know to build a typical if GM is building a typical car parts might go back and forth across that [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4435.66s)]
*  border five six seven different times and so the [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4442.26s)]
*  industry right now is really freaking out and saying we've never had to [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4446.1s)]
*  Grapple with the question of is it gonna be is a good gonna is it part gonna be tariffed? [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4450.82s)]
*  Steering wheel gonna be tariffed four or five different times. It goes across the border. How is this gonna work? And [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4455.3s)]
*  by the way, if Canada retaliates and [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4460.82s)]
*  Starts to cut off access to parts [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4463.780000000001s)]
*  That's gonna have a broader cascading impact on our company's ability to actually produce vehicles in the first place in the previous Trump term [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4467.02s)]
*  There was a lot of big talk on expo on imposing these kinds of broad [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4474.900000000001s)]
*  Tariffs, but he ultimately did a set of targeted or more targeted tariffs [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4480.66s)]
*  The by demonstration actually left some of those tariffs in place and then imposed a bunch on their own. There was a tariff on [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4484.58s)]
*  Electric cars batteries certain metals certain minerals even certain kinds of cranes [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4490.46s)]
*  Can you talk about the difference in the logic? [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4495.9s)]
*  Between the by demonstrations approach to tariffs and the Trump administration's approach to tariffs [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4498.7s)]
*  Yeah to shorthand it it's a difference between strategic and stupid [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4503.299999999999s)]
*  So there is there there is a real rationale an economic and national security rationale to use tariffs if other countries are [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4507.219999999999s)]
*  explicitly either illegally or [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4515.7s)]
*  Unfairly contorting their own industry in an effort to try to undermine [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4518.259999999999s)]
*  American industry in areas where we have a strategic [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4522.82s)]
*  strategic stake [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4527.179999999999s)]
*  Things where we need components that go into building planes and tanks that support our middle military things like critical minerals that are actually [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4528.419999999999s)]
*  Strategic and China could have a stranglehold on different supply chains in those areas [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4536.299999999999s)]
*  You can actually see a country like China is actually taking a legal action [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4541.0199999999995s)]
*  To try to subsidize its industry in a way that could then undercut US industry [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4545.179999999999s)]
*  It makes a lot of sense to actually step in and say no [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4549.58s)]
*  We're going to make sure that the US industry has a way to actually build and scale its own capabilities [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4551.98s)]
*  but to put the strategic versus stupid in in context the [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4557.9s)]
*  total amount of [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4563.54s)]
*  Goods that the Biden administration put tariffs on these strategic tariffs was about 18 billion dollars [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4565.3s)]
*  You compare that to what's on the table right now with Trump 1.4 trillion dollars [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4571.46s)]
*  So it's you know, people say it's a difference between a scalpel than a sledgehammer [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4576.7s)]
*  This is like a scalpel versus like a whole army versus of sledgehammers [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4580.9800000000005s)]
*  Just hitting anything that you could possibly hit and so even to give the the first Trump administration some credit under [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4585.22s)]
*  You know Bob Lighthizer and others the ultimate approach they took to China was more calibrated. It wasn't across the board [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4591.9800000000005s)]
*  It didn't hit everything it exempted consumer goods [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4598.98s)]
*  This approach is literally saying we'll just put a tariff on anything [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4601.86s)]
*  Even if the end result is you're pissing into a fan. It's all coming back. There's just there's not a [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4606.299999999999s)]
*  strategic rationale behind the approach so Trump bullies Columbia he gets a quick win [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4611.339999999999s)]
*  The damage to our reputation is a safe and reliable trading partner takes a hit but that's like very hard to measure [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4618.179999999999s)]
*  Trump is now obviously starting Canada starting China. He's running Mexico. He's also today was talking about the European Union [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4625.14s)]
*  What happens if the US tries to fight these different trade wars on multiple fronts and how could [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4634.740000000001s)]
*  Not just one country independently, but how could countries together? [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4642.3s)]
*  Respond in a way that harms our economy that harms our influence on the world stage [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4646.700000000001s)]
*  we benefit [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4652.660000000001s)]
*  when countries believe [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4654.58s)]
*  that when we [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4656.7s)]
*  Say something we're going to do it and that's a little bit of the problem with this strategy of constantly threatening everybody with tariffs [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4658.14s)]
*  Right is either one of two things happens one you threaten it and then pull it back [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4665.18s)]
*  It seems like what's happened with shine bomb even today [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4670.14s)]
*  The the 25% tariff is not going to go into effect today with Mexico [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4673.66s)]
*  But maybe it will go into effect a month from now you do that enough times and people start to [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4677.5599999999995s)]
*  Question whether the United States will actually do what it says or you follow through and [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4683.58s)]
*  The bullying tactic causes other people to recognize. Well, if you're gonna bully us, we're gonna go and find other friends [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4689.0199999999995s)]
*  we're gonna go and not rely on the United States anymore and [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4695.74s)]
*  Across time what that means is when it comes to security partnerships when it comes to economic partnerships [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4701.7s)]
*  countries just aren't going to be as willing or set a higher price to actually [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4707.219999999999s)]
*  Partner with with the US and look at the end of the day [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4712.26s)]
*  We should be prepared to stand up more aggressively when countries are cheating and breaking the rules [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4717.82s)]
*  And a lot of that is really a story about China and we should be more aggressive in saying [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4724.62s)]
*  China uses all of its tools of economic statecraft to actually flood markets like steel in the US to undercut our capacity [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4732.98s)]
*  We should be more vocal about that [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4740.78s)]
*  We shouldn't be apologized for saying we're gonna stand up for American interest [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4742.42s)]
*  the challenge is when you're doing that on multiple fronts and [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4746.18s)]
*  Not distinguishing between a country like China where you can identify multiple instances where they're doing this and Canada [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4749.54s)]
*  Where it's really hard to put like a sentence let alone a paragraph together of saying [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4755.9800000000005s)]
*  What is it that we're actually so concerned about or afraid about in that context, you know in the US stops? [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4760.9400000000005s)]
*  Differentiating between this then we're you know, you start to put us in a position where [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4768.38s)]
*  We're not gonna have many friends or allies around the world [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4772.9s)]
*  Is there any part of you that sees how Trump is kind of wielding America's economic power and think? [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4775.66s)]
*  Obviously, this is dangerous. This is reckless. This is careless, but there are ways in which Democrats [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4782.66s)]
*  were not as aggressive as they should have been that President Biden wasn't as aggressive as he shouldn't been like [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4789.46s)]
*  Is there a is there some middle distance between Trump's kind of careless and stupid wielding of America's power and our [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4794.46s)]
*  Kind of debt not just Democrats, but a bipartisan consensus that's been kind of a little bit more [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4801.7s)]
*  Deferential and a little bit more built around consensus. Yeah, look in the first instance [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4807.0599999999995s)]
*  I don't think we should denigrate a number of the goals that President Trump and his team are putting forward [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4810.86s)]
*  They're talking about wanting to have more, you know sustained strong economic growth in this country [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4815.54s)]
*  We should be shooting for that. My concern is not that goal [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4820.179999999999s)]
*  It's just I don't think that the policies are gonna get us there. He wants he's talking about building manufacturing capacity industrial capacity here in the US [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4822.76s)]
*  Right goal the quality the question is is any of this actually going to get there? [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4829.88s)]
*  So I think we should be we should be quite clear about saying these are goals that we share [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4833.64s)]
*  The question is how do we get there? [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4839.9400000000005s)]
*  And yes, I think that there are a number of places where we need to ask ourselves really hard questions about [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4841.72s)]
*  Are we using the tools we have to stand up as aggressively as we can? [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4849.3s)]
*  For the interests of American workers American consumers and where our economy is going to go over the medium term [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4854.700000000001s)]
*  But I also think we have to maintain this view that there that there is smart and stupid here, right? There is a [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4861.22s)]
*  Line between saying just because we have a tool you're gonna you know bang away at it versus you know what like [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4870.620000000001s)]
*  Putting more costs on typical consumers right now at the grocery store and the gas pump is just not a good idea [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4878.34s)]
*  And so we're gonna you know, we're gonna stand up and say we could you we could be using these tools more aggressively [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4884.58s)]
*  But to the end of actually for example having an auto industry that actually gets competitive again [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4892.0199999999995s)]
*  And that actually competes with China that would be a goal worth actually fighting for that would be a goal worth using our tools [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4896.599999999999s)]
*  More effectively before before we let you go [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4902.46s)]
*  You were the deputy director of OMB [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4905.18s)]
*  Elon Musk has basically helped lead a hostile takeover [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4907.9s)]
*  OMB was a source of that federal funding freeze memo that so to bunch of chaos last week [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4910.86s)]
*  What is your reaction to what's happening at OMB and? [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4916.98s)]
*  What is the power that OMB has if it is not restrained by either [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4922.42s)]
*  deference to [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4928.34s)]
*  political impact or deference to other agencies [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4930.18s)]
*  So the the power that OMB has within the executive branch and under the Constitution is quite limited [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4933.42s)]
*  Congress is responsible for appropriating money [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4941.06s)]
*  And the executive branch must follow the laws that Congress passes very quaint and OMB all exactly [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4943.620000000001s)]
*  But well, but well, but I think we're gonna come back to this which is and OMB is responsible for them [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4950.8s)]
*  executing those strategies on behalf of the executive branches that were appropriated fund and [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4956.5s)]
*  Yes, I hear you what you're saying is quaint but at the same time ultimately I think what we saw with the funding freeze is [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4961.58s)]
*  Where this is going which is notwithstanding some of the bluster [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4968.94s)]
*  It is it is actually the case that legally the executive branch cannot [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4974.379999999999s)]
*  Both spend money that Congress has not appropriated and it can't fail to spend money when Congress has said so I think we're gonna [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4980.099999999999s)]
*  Have a big we're gonna have a set of fights on this and this is going to get some of this is gonna get hashed [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4986.86s)]
*  out in the courts, but look I think having worked at OMB and having felt the constraints of [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4992.099999999999s)]
*  The fact that you know, you can't violate the the anti-deficiency act or the impoundment act [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=4997.5s)]
*  Even if there may be some impulse at some point to say boy, it would be great if we could stop that. I [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=5004.5s)]
*  think that you know, I am I am I am I [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=5010.42s)]
*  Believe that Congress is going to step in because one of the few roles that Congress actually [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=5014.0599999999995s)]
*  Cherishes in this context is they do have the power of the purse and without that it changes fundamentally [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=5020.0199999999995s)]
*  You know some some pretty big tenants of our constitutional system [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=5026.82s)]
*  Yeah said like a guy that didn't move a sofa bed [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=5030.38s)]
*  Into OMB to go hardcore for the record. We worked a lot of nights and weekends [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=5032.78s)]
*  At at OMB through the financial crisis and government shutdowns and the like there are [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=5038.34s)]
*  extraordinarily talented professionals who [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=5043.98s)]
*  Who I certainly worked hand in hand with over the weekend many times during my government service last question [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=5046.22s)]
*  If you were hoping Democrats were out there saying one thing about the tariffs about the trade war [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=5051.9s)]
*  What would that one thing be? [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=5057.38s)]
*  Why would we want consumers to pay more at the gas bump and more at the grocery store? [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=5059.14s)]
*  And more for their iPhones and their consumer electronics when we are not achieving anything as a country [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=5063.94s)]
*  Brian Deese so good to see you. Thanks for doing this and I know you worked hard [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=5069.58s)]
*  I worked with you at the time. I worked with you when you're not in that role, but when you're at [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=5073.9400000000005s)]
*  NEC and you are always you always were so tired looking god [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=5079.26s)]
*  You always looked exhausted that old nickname nights and nights and weekends love it. I think that's what we called you [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=5082.26s)]
*  All right. This is this interview is over [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=5088.26s)]
*  Before we go [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=5091.660000000001s)]
*  Two quick things love it or leave it has some great shows coming up [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=5092.860000000001s)]

*  Hell yeah, that's a that's a big line up. That's a great episode [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=5102.98s)]

*  No big deal [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=5113.04s)]
*  Also vote save America this month is making donations as part of their anxiety relief program to black led organizations and candidates of color [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=5114.54s)]
*  Helping them gain ground at the state and local level [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=5121.98s)]
*  candidates like Janelle Bynum Oregon's first black member of Congress who won her district by less than 12,000 votes in 2024 [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=5125.38s)]
*  whoo 12,000 votes and is great [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=5132.22s)]
*  She's a great lonely guy and she's in a must-win reelection bid that could determine whether Democrats take back the house in [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=5134.22s)]
*  2026 we would love it [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=5140.62s)]
*  If you would consider joining the anxiety relief program [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2T_zugJFg&t=5142.34s)]
