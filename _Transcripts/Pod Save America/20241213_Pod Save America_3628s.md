Video Description: America's corporate titans seem pretty happy about Donald Trump's election—even pitching in to his inaugural bash—and it's no big mystery why: he's promising yet again to slash their taxes. Meanwhile, in his TIME Person of the Year interview, Trump admits that he may not be able lower grocery prices after all. Oh, well! Jon and Dan dive into all the latest, including FBI Director Christopher Wray's resignation, Biden’s historic pardons, Nancy Mace's latest theatrics, and why Democrats are suddenly cozying up to Elon Musk.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Democrats MUST Fight Back Against Trump’s Tax Cuts for Billionaires
**Pod Save America:** [December 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE)
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Jon Favreau. I'm Dan Pfeiffer. On today's show [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=0.0s)]
*  Everyone seems to be doing the Trump dance as FBI director Christopher [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=5.24s)]
*  Wray goes down without a fight Democrats start flattering Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg sponsors the inauguration [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=9.08s)]
*  Trump meanwhile admits he might not be able to bring down prices after all during his big-time man of the year interview an [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=15.52s)]
*  Honor he celebrated at the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday by telling Wall Street. He cut their taxes [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=21.88s)]
*  Welcome to your populist realignment Dan [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=28.8s)]
*  But first we have some actual good news [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=34.08s)]
*  Stop it's real. I'm not not a joke. It's December 2024, right? It is it is. Okay. All right, cool [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=38.52s)]
*  Cool. It's been a while the White House announced on Thursday the president Biden made history by granting clemency to nearly [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=45.58s)]
*  1500 people and pardoning 39 others the largest single-day clemency action in modern history [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=52.44s)]
*  The 1500 number is people who had largely been living out lengthy sentences in home confinement because of the pandemic and [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=60.84s)]
*  Already had been reintegrated in their communities. Those sentences were commuted [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=69.52s)]
*  The 39 pardons went mostly to people convicted of nonviolent drug offenses when they were younger [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=74.24s)]
*  And who have sensed have since turned their lives around [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=79.2s)]
*  What do you think of the move pretty good? I love it. Love it. It's great [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=84.08s)]
*  I was I saw that this morning when I woke up way too early as usual and it was great news and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=87.64s)]
*  It's sort of what we've been waiting for like every time you have a transition from the president of one party to the president of the next [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=93.2s)]
*  the outgoing president's it's like furiously spends that last two months trying to [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=99.64s)]
*  Get as much as a possibly can fireproof their accomplishments use the powers they have and pardons is a big part of it [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=104.6s)]
*  And it had felt for the last couple weeks like that was not happening. I'm sure it was happening [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=110.67999999999999s)]
*  Internally because you don't they didn't just come up with these pardons yesterday like they've been working on this for a long time [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=115.84s)]
*  But it was good to see sort of that [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=119.96s)]
*  outgoing [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=123.52s)]
*  use of power in a way that was consistent with the president's values and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=124.68s)]
*  Protecting people from a dangerous thing that's gonna happen when Trump takes over [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=128.72s)]
*  In the in the statement White House also said that there would be [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=132.67999999999998s)]
*  further action in the days to come the office of the pardon attorney part of the Justice Department has received nearly [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=137.64s)]
*  12,000 requests for clemency during mr. Biden's term [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=144.95999999999998s)]
*  In 2022 and 2023 he pardoned anyone in federal prison for marijuana possession [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  He can also and has been urged to pardon or commute sentences of others convicted of nonviolent drug offenses [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=155.6s)]
*  Who are in federal prison? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=162.72s)]
*  some people have urged him to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=164.4s)]
*  Commute sentences for the 40 people who were on death row in federal prison and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=167.76s)]
*  reduce those sentences to life without parole [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=174.72s)]
*  So that they don't get the death penalty. Yeah, so altogether he is issued [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=178.44s)]
*  26 individual pardons and 135 [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=182.4s)]
*  commutations [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=185.36s)]
*  So what do you think what do you think's gonna be next? What do you think should be next? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=186.6s)]
*  I hope it's the the 40 death row inmates Joe Biden [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=189.52s)]
*  This has kind of been lost history, but Joe Biden was the first modern president elected who was it an opponent of the death penalty [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=193.36s)]
*  He gets the upside of his Catholicism [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=199.16s)]
*  and a [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=201.72s)]
*  Decade because he was obviously not as pro-choice as he is now for most of his life largely due to him being raised a Catholic [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=203.72s)]
*  But the I was there only 40 [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=211.95999999999998s)]
*  inmates on federal on death row in federal penitentiaries [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=216.0s)]
*  There's you know huge numbers of them at state at and state prisons [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=218.23999999999998s)]
*  But it would send a powerful signal to do that on his way out the door [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=222.35999999999999s)]
*  So I certainly hope that that is something that is on the list of things [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=226.68s)]
*  They're actively considering over the last month here [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=229.72s)]
*  And it seems like from all kinds of reporting now since last time we talked about it that he's still considering [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=232.16s)]
*  preemptive blanket pardons for [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=238.56s)]
*  some folks on Trump's enemies list and [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=240.64000000000001s)]
*  And Trump has now talked about the January 6th committee talked about Jack Smith [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=243.68s)]
*  So I guess we'll wait and see if he does that I still see the many Thompson said he'd take one [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=249.96s)]
*  I did see Benny Tom. He'll take one. You know what which I respect all these people playing coy [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=255.18s)]
*  You know Adam Schiff being like oh, I don't think it's a good idea. Yeah, Adam Schiff. Don't don't please don't give me a pardon [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=260.72s)]
*  That's me winking for those who listening to it on their phones [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=267.48s)]
*  I mean not to dwell on this again, but you know it crossed my mind since we were talking about [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=270.12s)]
*  pardons and commutations today [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=276.66s)]
*  Why do you think he didn't wait to do the hunter pardon until? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=279.68s)]
*  After a move like this you know we talked about this on a [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=283.96000000000004s)]
*  Tuesday show and Tommy mentioned that he wanted to do the hunter pardon before hunter was sentenced [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=288.16s)]
*  Though I guess I understand that though you could also make an argument that after hunter was sentenced [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=293.12s)]
*  Perhaps commuting the sentence altogether would have been [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=299.12s)]
*  received better [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=303.16s)]
*  Our our old pal Anita Dunn who's one of the was one of the closest aides to Joe Biden for [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=305.16s)]
*  Not just his presidency, but like much of his career [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=312.32s)]
*  She said recently at a New York Times Dealbook event [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=316.72s)]
*  I don't agree with the way it was done [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=319.64s)]
*  I don't agree with the timing and I don't agree frankly with the attack on our judicial system [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=321.64s)]
*  The argument is one I think that many observers are concerned about a president who ran to restore the rule of law who has [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=326.4s)]
*  Upheld the rule of law who has really defended the rule of law kind of saying well, maybe not right now I [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=331.96s)]
*  Thought a lot about how and why the White House did it this way and I think it's pretty simple. I think it is a very [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=337.76s)]
*  Like we know all the people work in the White House. They are very smart. They know exactly how [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=345.12s)]
*  Shooting out the hunter Biden pardon on its own before you pardon anyone else on a Sunday night at the end of Thanksgiving weekend [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=350.56s)]
*  Is going to before you jet off to Angola is going to look [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=355.76s)]
*  Which is why most of them weren't involved. Yeah. Well, I mean he called the White House and said this is what we're doing [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=360.32s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. No, I mean most most of the very smart White House staff that we did not know until it was [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=365.4s)]
*  They didn't know that [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=369.92s)]
*  They didn't know he'd made the decision to do it, but I'm sure there's a conversation on rollout, right and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=371.84000000000003s)]
*  President came back from Thanksgiving with his family where they had a family meeting about this hunter was at that meeting [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=376.64s)]
*  Hunter is staring down the barrel of going to prison [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=382.24s)]
*  Soon and the president makes a decision. He calls back and says that I've made this decision and then they have a choice [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=385.84000000000003s)]
*  Do they just do it right away before it leaks or do they allow it to leak out there that he is thinking about it? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=392.08000000000004s)]
*  And then face a bunch of pressure and so this is not how anyone would design I think just it's a very this is how the process [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=398.08s)]
*  Works and it takes a long time to get [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=404.08s)]
*  1300 [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=407.11999999999995s)]
*  Commutations and pardons together and that process was ongoing and not yet finished when he made this decision at Thanksgiving [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=408.32s)]
*  Yeah, look, there's no plan that had it this way [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=414.23999999999995s)]
*  It's just like this is how life unfolded and this was a family issue [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=416.79999999999995s)]
*  And the one thing you always read in the reporting is on family stuff [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=420.08s)]
*  And I mean I won't criticize it all over again. I already did I will say that [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=423.59999999999997s)]
*  These pardons and commutations [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=430.88s)]
*  They do make me feel better about the whole thing [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=434.0s)]
*  I also think that if he [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=437.59999999999997s)]
*  Like I said issues, you know these preemptive pardons and blanket pardons and and makes them about sort of preemptive pardons [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=440.24s)]
*  Like I said issues, you know these preemptive pardons and blanket pardons and and makes them about sort of protecting people from [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=447.20000000000005s)]
*  Political vengeance and retribution by donald trump and the hunter pardon is sort of [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=456.40000000000003s)]
*  Fits into that bucket then I then I feel even better even though i'm, you know disappointed that he lied to us [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=462.32000000000005s)]
*  All right elsewhere in the justice system [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=469.36s)]
*  There is less reason for celebration [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=471.92s)]
*  Uh, FBI, i'm glad we got that happiness out of the way. Let's yeah now [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=474.64000000000004s)]
*  FBI director chris ray announced wednesday that he would step down at some point before trump's inauguration on january 20th paving the way for [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=478.96000000000004s)]
*  Trump hatchet man cash patel to take over as head of the world's premier investigative agency [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=487.76000000000005s)]
*  Uh ray said in his statement quote in my view [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=494.0s)]
*  This is the best way to avoid dragging the bureau deeper into the fray while reinforcing the values and principles [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=496.16s)]
*  That are so important to how we do our work [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=503.14s)]
*  Uh a lot of folks aren't happy to say the least jonathan shade at the atlantic in a piece called a scandalous resignation [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=506.58s)]
*  Summed it up this way quote the president-elect had been facing the unpleasant task of firing a lifelong republican whom he had selected himself [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=512.66s)]
*  Inviting the national media to raise ugly questions about his oft-confessed desire to turn the federal criminal justice apparatus into a weapon of political vengeance [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=521.0600000000001s)]
*  Instead ray like so many republicans who couldn't stomach trump's demands decided to go gentle into that good night [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=529.38s)]
*  Nobody except ray will remember where they were when christopher ray resigned [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=537.0600000000001s)]
*  ouch [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=542.02s)]
*  um [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=542.98s)]
*  I mean you can sympathize with ray not wanting to just sit around and wait for trump to fire him [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=544.1800000000001s)]
*  But I don't know. What do you think was this the right move? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=548.66s)]
*  absolutely not [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=551.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean just [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=554.26s)]
*  The fbi position of fbi director is one of the most powerful in this country [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=556.26s)]
*  You have an army of investigators and law enforcement officers who work for you. It is so powerful that unlike the department defense [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=560.02s)]
*  the director of the cia [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=567.4599999999999s)]
*  congress gave the fbi director [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=569.4599999999999s)]
*  10 year non-consecutive terms so you can't amass too much power and you are [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=571.9399999999999s)]
*  uh insulated from the influence of individual presidents and [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=576.66s)]
*  members of congress [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=581.3s)]
*  And donald trump for the second time now is firing an fbi director [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=582.9s)]
*  And this is a in in this case [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=587.06s)]
*  He is doing it and he wants to to install a loyalist who has published [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=588.42s)]
*  An actual list of the enemies who he wants to prosecute and that should be a big giant deal [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=594.34s)]
*  And it's not going to be because chris ray just slouched off into retirement [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=599.6999999999999s)]
*  and so instead you have to pick up the alternative scenario where [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=604.9s)]
*  Joe biden leaves donald trump is sworn in he walks in the white house [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=607.9399999999999s)]
*  And then he fires the fbi director who has years left on his term that was confirmed by the senate [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=611.3s)]
*  And to replace him with cash patel further, but because ray resigned [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=616.74s)]
*  When he when he is trying to appoint cash patel, it's just going to seem like he's filling any other cabinet [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=621.38s)]
*  empty cabinet vacancy like all the rest of them and [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=627.06s)]
*  it just [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=630.74s)]
*  You can't this is it is a big deal what he is doing with the fbi and chris ray made it seem like a lot less big [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=632.74s)]
*  Deal so he did not uphold any of those values and principles that he talks about he actually undermined them by giving into trump [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=638.1s)]
*  Pure cowardice in my opinion pure cowardice [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=645.3000000000001s)]
*  I think I agree [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=648.1s)]
*  Just for the sake of argument. Well, let's hear it. Uh, no, I guess what [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=649.94s)]
*  What benefit? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=654.82s)]
*  to [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=656.34s)]
*  the country [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=657.94s)]
*  uh [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=659.38s)]
*  or politically for those who oppose trump would have come from [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=660.5s)]
*  ray [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=665.62s)]
*  waiting [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=666.82s)]
*  Getting fired and then cash patel gets the job anyway [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=668.1800000000001s)]
*  Just a little bit later than he would have and donald trump gets [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=673.0600000000001s)]
*  a couple days worth of [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=678.1800000000001s)]
*  Very critical stories and commentary by all of us for firing the fbi director [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=680.5s)]
*  In the end if cash patel is going to be the fbi director [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=687.86s)]
*  In either way, it's not going to make a huge difference to the benny thompson's adam shifts [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=691.0600000000001s)]
*  You know anthony falch is the world are going to be investigated [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=695.38s)]
*  But it is a chance to grab the nation's attention for just a moment to show how dangerous this is because as we're going to talk [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=698.3399999999999s)]
*  About this podcast [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=704.5799999999999s)]
*  We all ran around for a year and a half saying that donald trump was an existential threat to democracy [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=705.9399999999999s)]
*  One of the reasons he was an existential threat to marcy is because every fucking morning before breakfast [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=710.9799999999999s)]
*  He announced on true social that he was going to investigate all of his political opponents in which we just which [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=714.9s)]
*  We said was fascist and authoritarian and dangerous and now he's doing that exact thing [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=719.9399999999999s)]
*  and so many people [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=724.26s)]
*  chris ray included or sort of like [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=725.94s)]
*  And maybe not that big a deal [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=727.62s)]
*  And so if it is as big a deal as we think it is and I imagine chris ray probably thinks it is [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=729.0600000000001s)]
*  Then you have to at least try to tell that story and it makes it harder to tell that story if you're just going to [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=733.46s)]
*  Hand the keys of the fbi to cash patel as opposed to making donald trump take them from you [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=739.7s)]
*  And do it like this is what preet did as us as us attorney in new york [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=744.26s)]
*  He made trump fire him [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=749.14s)]
*  Yeah, and that was a big deal and firing the fbi director is a huge deal [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=750.66s)]
*  And it should it should get that attention and it won't because of chris ray [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=754.98s)]
*  I do [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=759.6999999999999s)]
*  My first reaction was like sort of the way he left like less about [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=761.06s)]
*  I'm quitting your firing me [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=766.5s)]
*  Uh in the in the difference between that and more about like chris ray, I think has an obligation [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=768.5799999999999s)]
*  um [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=774.5s)]
*  Whether he does it after he leaves or now or if he had waited and got fired [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=775.62s)]
*  But he has an obligation. I think to let people know [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=780.66s)]
*  That he did a good job [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=784.8199999999999s)]
*  and the reason he's being fired is because he [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=787.14s)]
*  Carried out his duties to uh, investigate [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=792.3399999999999s)]
*  The president united states for stealing classified information and that's why they went to marlago and he by the way [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=796.18s)]
*  Um retrieved classified information that the president had stole the ex-president at that point had stolen [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=802.9s)]
*  And refused to give back and obstructed justice like I do think that a little bit a defense of the bureau and the bureau's actions [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=809.62s)]
*  over the last several years [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=816.82s)]
*  And just making sure people know that they played it pretty fucking straight [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=818.82s)]
*  Um over the last several years after he was appointed by donald trump [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=823.86s)]
*  And is a republican himself [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=828.6600000000001s)]
*  I do think he has an obligation just for [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=830.98s)]
*  The public to know that and if people don't care then they're free not to care [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=833.62s)]
*  But might as well tell that story [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=838.9000000000001s)]
*  I'm sure you i'm sure we'll get to read it in a book coming out in october 2025 [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=842.1s)]
*  Maybe he can maybe he can do a press conference with jim comey [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=845.7800000000001s)]
*  Maybe they can do i'll send i'll send him a invite link to substax see if he can get started early [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=848.26s)]
*  also, I think there and um jvl made this point, uh in his uh newsletter tonight [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=852.74s)]
*  Bullwork that anything anything? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=857.86s)]
*  that the uh that the people who oppose trump or at least the people who want to defend our democratic institutions anything they do to sort of [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=860.74s)]
*  delay [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=868.32s)]
*  um trump and his minions from uh [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=870.0200000000001s)]
*  Doing what they want to do is a good thing and so cash patel getting in [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=874.26s)]
*  Uh earlier than he would have if we had to go through chris ray getting fired [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=879.46s)]
*  um, you know, it's [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=883.5400000000001s)]
*  It would have been nice would have been nice and any any delay tactics here are probably helpful. Um, so that's [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=885.78s)]
*  Don't don't I have not heard a really good argument for uh [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=892.18s)]
*  For chris ray doing it the way he did, but maybe he'll speak up soon [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=896.5799999999999s)]
*  um [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=900.42s)]
*  One factor that seems to be making the rain news tougher to swallow [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=901.6999999999999s)]
*  Uh is that it's not just ray [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=904.5s)]
*  Obviously you and melissa talked about wednesday jack smith also made the decision to resign rather than get fired [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=906.66s)]
*  And in general it seems like a lot of big players corporations [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=912.42s)]
*  media outlets even some elected democrats [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=916.26s)]
*  Are employing a kinder gentler approach to trump's second term so far [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=919.62s)]
*  Um, here's an incomplete accounting from just the last few days [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=924.58s)]
*  Meta gave a million dollars to trump's inauguration after mark zuckerberg had dinner with trump [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=928.1s)]
*  amazon giving a million dollars to thanks jeff bezos the ceo of time [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=933.2s)]
*  Uh the magazine which just named trump person of the year [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=938.8199999999999s)]
*  Accompanied him to the new york stock exchange and started clapping and chanting usa usa when trump rang the bell [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=943.28s)]
*  the fuck [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=951.46s)]
*  uh democratic senator john federman joined truth social and said that not only was the [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=952.9s)]
*  hunter biden pardon correct, but that trump deserves a pardon too for his conviction in the manhattan case [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=959.14s)]
*  Uh and other democrats like congressman richie torrez and senator richard blumenthal have been praising elon musk [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=967.0600000000001s)]
*  With blumenthal calling him the tech industry's quote champion of free speech [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=973.62s)]
*  Uh rocana has said he's been trading texts with elon and called him an extraordinary entrepreneur [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=978.4200000000001s)]
*  Though said he also was clear with him where he disagreed [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=984.9s)]
*  Federman compared elon to tony stark [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=988.34s)]
*  Look [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=991.14s)]
*  So [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=994.02s)]
*  A lot of cliches you could reach for here if you can't beat him join him [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=995.38s)]
*  Discretion is the better part of valor better to be at the table than on the menu [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=998.74s)]
*  Uh, what do you think is going on here and obviously [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1005.2199999999999s)]
*  All the different people I just mentioned there they could all have different motivations [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1009.06s)]
*  There could be different degrees of kissing donald trump's ass and elon musk's ass, but what do you think is going on here? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1012.66s)]
*  So let's probably try to separate this out into a couple groups. Yeah, there are [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1019.54s)]
*  corporations [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1024.3999999999999s)]
*  Which are staring down the prospect of an all you can eat buffet of corporate corporate greed under donald trump [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1025.7s)]
*  Less taxes we're getting to that. Yeah, we're getting to that less regulation and just fucking pay to play left and right and they are chomping at the bit [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1033.1399999999999s)]
*  A lot of these are tech companies who like this probably somebody with meta who are [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1040.98s)]
*  Have felt like they could not [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1046.02s)]
*  Acquire other companies under lena kahn's ftc because of biden's very good antitrust policies [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1048.58s)]
*  So the corporations are they are they're going to be donald trump's friend because donald trump's going to do [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1055.22s)]
*  Uh what they want? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1059.62s)]
*  And I think if they think and they know they know if you're friends with donald trump is just he is like an old school [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1061.3s)]
*  Corrupt politician if you're friends with him, he will hook you up with some government contracts some other stuff [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1066.02s)]
*  Then you have democrats who are trying to figure out how to deal with elon musk as a public figure [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1070.82s)]
*  Someone who is quite popular with a group of voters that we lost right namely young men and [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1077.86s)]
*  That he in understanding that he is a world famous very successful [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1084.18s)]
*  business person and [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1089.94s)]
*  He is taking on a task and I think that they are and I think rocana in particular probably pretty smart about this and he [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1092.82s)]
*  Has a relationship with elon from [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1098.34s)]
*  Long time in california [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1100.34s)]
*  But I mean he was a commerce department appointee in the obama administration when elon was hoovering down [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1101.94s)]
*  solar tax credits for tesla, but [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1108.26s)]
*  Huge fan of the recovery act that elon musk [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1111.94s)]
*  the [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1115.46s)]
*  But I think the way we navigate the doge commission requires some deafness because what they are want to do [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1116.5s)]
*  At the service level is quite popular get rid of waste and fraud and abuse in government like everyone agrees with that [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1123.6200000000001s)]
*  And so you want to be in the situation where you promise you're agreeing to work with them and then when they come back with [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1129.6200000000001s)]
*  Other social security cuts in their elimination department of education then you hammer them [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1134.02s)]
*  So I think that's the appropriate way there. I can't I don't know what I can't speak to what john federman's doing [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1137.7s)]
*  I don't really understand the [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1141.8600000000001s)]
*  Going on going on true social. Yeah, that's fine. Gavin newson did that a long time ago. That doesn't bother me [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1144.1000000000001s)]
*  Um offering suggesting trump get a pardon that seems primarily like trolling. I don't really get that but [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1150.3400000000001s)]
*  And then I think there's this other thing that I think we all have to remind ourselves [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1155.62s)]
*  As we think about the next four years, we are never running at santa trump again. Yeah [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1160.1799999999998s)]
*  He is not our opponent the first four years of trump was about every single day trying to [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1164.9799999999998s)]
*  Increase the likelihood that we could beat him in the 2020 election and we succeeded [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1171.62s)]
*  Not as well as we would like but we did succeed because he's back [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1176.8999999999999s)]
*  But this time are we have a different set of tasks so we don't necessarily have to [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1179.86s)]
*  Have to if we agree with trump on something that is popular it is okay [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1183.7s)]
*  To agree with him and then like take that issue off the table [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1189.3799999999999s)]
*  Like we don't have to oppose him on every single thing if it is an area of potential agreement [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1193.1399999999999s)]
*  We also don't have to chase him down every rabbit hole, right? [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1197.94s)]
*  We can our task is not to beat trump. It is to rebuild our brand and then separate [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1200.8999999999999s)]
*  The new trump coalition from the republican party that comes after trump [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1207.3799999999999s)]
*  And so we have to think with that mentality and that does mean it's just a very different approach than resistance 1.0 [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1210.8200000000002s)]
*  My critique is with none of that [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1217.0600000000002s)]
*  And I don't think that what you just said is necessarily reflective of what any of these fucking characters are doing or saying right now [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1219.22s)]
*  Like I think roe roe is my exception to this right? I roe is the exception but I even think that [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1226.5800000000002s)]
*  You don't need to call elon musk anything nice at all [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1234.02s)]
*  To be willing to play ball [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1239.94s)]
*  With the doge thing and say and putting out a list of reforms that you want [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1242.5s)]
*  I mean I was saying this I think the democrat should should put out their own list before [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1248.02s)]
*  Elon and vivek have their own list and make it about the corporate subsidies. We want to get rid of [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1252.58s)]
*  Uh, the tax breaks we want to get rid of other waste and abuse that we're comfortable getting rid of like let's do our [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1258.98s)]
*  Own thing and then when they don't then when they don't agree to it [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1263.86s)]
*  Then we can hit them over it, right? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1266.98s)]
*  like let's have a let's be constructive on policy [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1269.0600000000002s)]
*  And governing when we agree and let's be really tough [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1273.8600000000001s)]
*  On policy and governing when we disagree but like we don't have to say nice fucking things about these people [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1278.74s)]
*  We don't have to kiss trump's we don't have to we shouldn't we shouldn't chase trump down every rabbit hole for sure [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1284.98s)]
*  We also don't need to fucking kiss his ass and also this is like you think democrats are kissing his ass [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1290.3400000000001s)]
*  No, no, no, not not trump. Elon musk stuff is a little bit [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1295.78s)]
*  Dick blumenthal what that's crazy. That's crazy. He's a champion of free speech. He's not a champion of free. There is there is a moment [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1299.22s)]
*  When you lose election, everyone loses their fucking mind for like 90 days. That's what's good. That's dumb shit, right? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1307.94s)]
*  And also they overreact mark zuckerberg like there that's a did it's that there are a few humans more full of shit [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1313.22s)]

*  Those are the taxes he wants to cut. Yes. Yes. Those are the taxes he wants to cut [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1643.3000000000002s)]
*  Under this [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1648.5800000000002s)]
*  So trump lowered the corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent in the 2017 tax cuts [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1649.86s)]
*  Now he wants to lower it to 15 percent [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1657.9399999999998s)]
*  He says he wants to do it 15 percent [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1660.9799999999998s)]
*  Uh, and there's a new twist on it with like if you if you invest in america if you do business here [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1663.3s)]
*  I don't know how that works, but a 50 in general a 15 percent [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1668.26s)]
*  corporate tax rate [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1673.3s)]
*  would give the largest 10 companies in america a [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1675.1399999999999s)]
*  23 billion dollar tax cut for 10 companies that reported more than 520 billion dollars in profits [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1678.96s)]
*  Uh, this was a cap analysis over the summer meta [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1687.14s)]
*  His new pal mark zuckerberg would get 1.4 [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1690.8200000000002s)]
*  Billion dollars just for meta from trump's plan united health. Have you heard about united health lately? [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1694.4s)]
*  United health would get 1.3 [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1701.7s)]
*  billion dollars a tax cut and [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1704.16s)]
*  Five largest grocery companies because of obviously trump was elected to lower prices for people. That's what he told us [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1707.46s)]
*  Um, but he doesn't want to give the five largest grocery companies 1.7 billion dollars in tax cuts [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1713.5400000000002s)]
*  These are five, uh grocery companies that made 29 billion dollars in profits as a bunch of people [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1720.5s)]
*  Could not afford their groceries and now he wants to give him another 1.7 billion dollars [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1727.0600000000002s)]
*  You think they're going to use that 1.7 billion dollar tax cut to lower the cost of food? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1730.98s)]
*  So people can buy their groceries probably right isn't that what happened when they did the exact same thing in 2017? [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1735.62s)]
*  Yeah, no, yeah, 40 points. Yeah, they they passed the savings onto their consumers and their employees [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1740.98s)]
*  Lots of people and yeah, oh wait wait ceo bonuses and stock buybacks. That's right. That's right. Yes [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1745.7s)]
*  So that is what trump promised [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1752.58s)]
*  um [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1754.82s)]
*  now [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1756.42s)]
*  you know [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1757.46s)]
*  We knew this during the campaign [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1758.8999999999999s)]
*  Uh that I think kamala [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1760.8999999999999s)]
*  Hit trump on this a few times the corporate tax cut, uh, obviously did not work or at least it did not work well enough [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1764.02s)]
*  um [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1771.94s)]
*  What is your advice here to democrats on how to make it stick in the next year? Uh in a way that we [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1773.06s)]
*  Did not do as successfully as we could have [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1780.26s)]
*  during the campaign [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1783.3799999999999s)]
*  She did mention you said the operative word here was she hit him on it a few times [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1784.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and there were a lot of ads on it. There wasn't the most the [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1788.98s)]
*  Ad that future forward the super PAC spent the most money on was on this very topic [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1792.3400000000001s)]
*  It was called the buddy ad and it had a guy [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1795.78s)]
*  Watching an ipad of trump saying to the people at marl the donors at marlago your riches hell [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1798.5800000000002s)]
*  And i'm gonna cut your taxes and then went on to say what kamala harris was going to do to raise taxes on billy nose [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1802.18s)]
*  But it was never a centerpiece of the campaign. It never was a defining issue [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1807.46s)]
*  we can never make it stick and that I think has more to do with the [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1810.66s)]
*  Short runway the harris campaign had maybe [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1816.66s)]
*  You know some just the dominance of inflation as an issue [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1820.18s)]
*  Uh that it didn't stick like I do not take the fact that trump won as evidence that all of a sudden tax cuts for corporations are popular [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1824.34s)]
*  Far from it, and I think this is our best [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1831.14s)]
*  bet to [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1834.58s)]
*  Really begin to [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1837.46s)]
*  Make some cracks in the trump coalition right people elected trump to lower their costs [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1839.8600000000001s)]
*  And so our message is pretty clear [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1845.38s)]
*  Trump is not lowering your costs. He's lower. He's cutting taxes for the wealthy corporations the very companies who are [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1848.0200000000002s)]
*  Making billions of dollars by jacking up prices on your groceries and your gas [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1855.3000000000002s)]
*  He's going to give them a tax cut and you're not going to get and he's not trying to help you [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1859.38s)]
*  We're trying to help them [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1862.5s)]
*  And then there's a second element of this which I think is important which is we have to make this all seem like [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1863.5400000000002s)]
*  as it is [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1867.8600000000001s)]
*  giant fucking corruption [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1868.98s)]
*  You have him promising it to his donors [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1871.14s)]
*  You have a bunch of billionaires who are going to benefit from these working in the government [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1872.9s)]
*  You have trump himself working in it. You have companies given a million dollars the inauguration who are going to get huge benefits [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1875.94s)]
*  Like we have to show that this is the exact [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1881.38s)]
*  Corruption that people trump said he was going to fix and now he is not fixing it [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1884.0s)]
*  He's exacerbating it to help the rich at your expense [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1887.7s)]
*  And so and then the the last piece of this is how is this all going to get paid for in the end? [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1891.14s)]
*  it's going to add trillions of dollars to deficit and or and [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1895.38s)]
*  Elon musk and vivek are going to want to pay for it by cutting social security medicare and getting rid of the affordable care act [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1898.1000000000001s)]
*  Is that what we're going to do? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1902.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and so I think those are sort of the three steps there [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1903.94s)]
*  I [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1907.22s)]
*  Totally agree with all that. I also think [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1908.26s)]
*  like we've got to be able to [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1911.06s)]
*  Make this real for people and tell stories about it that are not just sort of the typical [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1913.78s)]
*  He's giving tax cuts to the rich and not you, you know, like that's that is the that's the message [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1920.9s)]
*  But we've got to sort of um add some color to the message so that it breaks through I think a fair [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1925.54s)]
*  lot of critiques [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1931.7s)]
*  From the left about kamala harris and the campaign and all this we've heard them all we're not going to do it all here [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1933.14s)]
*  I think one that is fair [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1939.14s)]
*  is [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1941.14s)]
*  I don't think she is someone who like [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1942.42s)]
*  feels the [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1945.6200000000001s)]
*  the populist anger [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1947.8600000000001s)]
*  towards [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1950.18s)]
*  Like companies that are price gouging and taking advantage of people and making record profits while people can barely [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1951.14s)]
*  Get by like she doesn't really feel that in her bones [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1957.38s)]
*  At least that doesn't come across during the campaign. I realize it was a short campaign and to be fair [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1960.66s)]
*  You don't get that from a lot of democrats [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1966.18s)]
*  um, and [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1968.3400000000001s)]
*  I you know, I don't know which podcast I said this on but i've been complaining about [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1969.94s)]
*  the glorification of uh, and the hero status awarded to luigi mangione [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1975.6200000000001s)]
*  but I also think there is a [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1982.1000000000001s)]
*  large space between that [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1984.02s)]
*  And saying eh, whatever rich people are rich people health care companies make profits. That's what they do, right? [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1986.74s)]
*  Like I do think that people should be going out the democrats should be going out there every day talking about [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1992.58s)]
*  These companies that are going to get a huge fucking windfall for nothing who have been gouging consumers [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=1998.9s)]
*  Raising prices in a country where people are really struggling to get by with their costs and like tell a story about it [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2004.74s)]
*  Every single day make it the message over and over and over again [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2010.42s)]
*  And you've got to be creative and you've got to figure out ways to break through [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2013.94s)]
*  And you can't just be saying the same fucking words over and over again [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2017.1399999999999s)]
*  That seemed like they came from a poll that tested really well, like you've got to really you know [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2019.3799999999999s)]
*  Make it make it real for folks [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2024.42s)]
*  And so that's what i'm kind of hoping democrats do in this fight like it's not enough to just do the same old same old [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2026.02s)]
*  One simple way to do that is to juxtapose the tax rates of these corporations with the tax rates of people [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2031.86s)]
*  right [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2038.02s)]
*  then yeah [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2038.8999999999999s)]
*  Walmart's gonna pay a lower tax rate than people who work at walmart or shop at walmart [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2040.18s)]
*  And and then I know I could already hear our fucking econ policy buddies saying it's totally unfair to compare individual corporate tax rates [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2044.3400000000001s)]
*  But I do not care [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2049.86s)]
*  Go go on another podcast complain about that. All right [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2052.58s)]
*  People think it's like oh, it's the corporate money that's doing this and it's the donors that have captured the democrats [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2055.62s)]
*  It's like no, it's like the fucking wonks [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2060.34s)]
*  No, that's not the reason we know we know all the reasons [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2064.34s)]
*  Why you know that we know that corporate greed is not the only reason that people are struggling to get by we know that but [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2068.18s)]
*  It is disgusting that people are getting tax breaks [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2074.2599999999998s)]
*  CEOs executives shareholders [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2079.3599999999997s)]
*  When so many people are struggling and we're still dealing with high prices that it's fucking it's it's crazy [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2083.06s)]
*  So but like it should feel crazy [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2089.3799999999997s)]
*  To the democrats going out there and talking about it [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2092.34s)]
*  And it should feel like it is a mission and that they are like offended on behalf of the american people by it [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2095.3s)]
*  And that's the kind of energy I think we we need in this fight [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2102.34s)]
*  the people who [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2105.86s)]
*  Get who decided this election for trump did not send him to washington to cut taxes for corporations [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2107.38s)]
*  No, they're gonna be fucking shocked. That's one of the first things he does [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2113.3s)]
*  well, look i've [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2116.9s)]
*  i've seen the polling on this right like tax cuts for [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2118.26s)]
*  The one percent for billionaires like they are less popular sometimes than corporate tax cuts because what they try to do [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2121.78s)]
*  When they talk about corporate tax cuts they say well, it's a lot of small businesses and when you give them tax cuts [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2127.38s)]
*  Then they create jobs [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2132.82s)]
*  And so if if corporations are doing well, then they hire more people and then wages go up and like they do this whole [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2134.1000000000004s)]
*  Fucking song and dance. I really think you got to hammer the fact that like we're talking about some of the most profitable [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2139.0600000000004s)]
*  Corporations in the country who last time they got this tax cut used it to enrich their executives and their shareholders [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2145.78s)]
*  And did not do anything about prices and did not hire more people and did not raise wages [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2152.6600000000003s)]
*  like one of the [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2157.3s)]
*  Thing we could do 17 podcasts and we will do 17 podcasts on the corporate tax fight on the tax on the larger tax [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2159.2200000000003s)]
*  I come up one thing democrats can do [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2163.78s)]
*  Is you pick an income level by which you agree to extend them but anything below x you're gonna understand and then you make the [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2166.26s)]
*  which is what [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2172.1800000000003s)]
*  Uh eventually happened with obama and the bush tax cuts and then the fight becomes about anything above that number [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2173.2999999999997s)]
*  and so like we'd say we'd pass it tomorrow that everyone who makes under [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2178.02s)]
*  300 000 a year i'm just picking a number out of out of the sky [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2182.7999999999997s)]
*  Uh that there's tax that we send it but anything above that [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2186.1s)]
*  That they're fighting over that and so you got to isolate the fight for the very very wealthy in the corporations. Yeah, I agree [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2189.7799999999997s)]
*  Uh, well speaking of that [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2195.54s)]
*  so [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2197.22s)]
*  part of the time person of the year routine is you you sit down for a lengthy interview with the magazine which [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2197.9399999999996s)]
*  Trump did at mar-a-lago in late november [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2202.6600000000003s)]
*  Uh, it just was released on thursday. So it's a little uh little dated but uh interviews very long [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2205.94s)]
*  Most of it wasn't very newsy but few notable things we hadn't heard before [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2211.7000000000003s)]
*  At one point the reporters asked trump quote if the prices of groceries don't come down [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2215.7000000000003s)]
*  Will your presidency be a failure and his answer? [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2220.7400000000002s)]
*  I don't think so. Look they got them up. I'd like to bring them down [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2224.02s)]
*  It's hard to bring things down once they're up, you know, it's very hard [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2228.4199999999996s)]
*  Uh, and then he goes on to talk about his solutions which are just [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2232.98s)]
*  Fixing the supply chain which joe biden has been doing for the last four years [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2236.8199999999997s)]
*  Um and lowering energy costs which is involves [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2240.66s)]
*  Drilling more for oil that won't do anything about uh that won't do anything to lower gas prices for years [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2244.8999999999996s)]
*  If they start drilling now because also we're producing more oil than any time uh in history. Um [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2250.74s)]
*  Kind of a wow moment there trump's saying I don't know if prices will actually go down [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2257.3s)]
*  Uh, uh, we find out on the day that he goes to the stock exchange and is like, but your taxes are going down wall street [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2261.38s)]
*  That's the juxtaposition right there, right? Which is he's not going to lower [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2268.9s)]
*  He's not going to lower your costs [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2271.94s)]
*  But he's going to lower he's going to lower the taxes for the wealthy in the corporations like that's sort of where you sit there [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2273.78s)]
*  as if it's like it's not a wow moment for people who took like [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2278.42s)]
*  Two semesters of econ, but it is it runs but we should make [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2281.62s)]
*  Absolute hey because it's what he promised he promised he would lower costs [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2285.7s)]
*  And we have to hammer him when costs do not go down. They will continue to go up. They always do [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2289.4599999999996s)]
*  and [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2294.74s)]
*  We like make that point make them own it, right? [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2295.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and I think we need a we need to come out with some uh plans of our own to lower costs for people [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2298.8199999999997s)]
*  um, and and do so in a way that is you know [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2306.2599999999998s)]
*  achievable real [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2310.24s)]
*  that are paid for that, uh, you know isn't just government spending money but also sort of regulating companies and making companies actually [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2313.06s)]
*  Like do well by their workers, right? Like I think that there's a like a good [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2322.8199999999997s)]
*  Progressive populist agenda here that also like makes sense to most americans [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2327.7s)]
*  Um that we should uh, we should be pushing here, but I don't know what you I don't know what the answer [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2332.4199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, we should have plans sure we should have plans, but we need a [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2337.46s)]
*  We need a simple idea [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2341.62s)]
*  that would also probably anger the econ nerds, but that like I think it's something that we [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2344.02s)]
*  We don't understand the power the the power of symbolism in our ideas and we're more focused on the substance [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2350.5s)]
*  It's like yes, we're gonna have a 12-point plan and it's gonna do all these things [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2355.54s)]
*  It's just like you know like trump building the wall in getting mexico to pay for it [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2358.42s)]
*  Like the voters know that that was an absurd thing [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2362.26s)]
*  But it sent a signal about them. So what like the the wealth tax was an example of an idea that [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2364.9s)]
*  is [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2372.42s)]
*  Tells a story about who you are more than the specifics of the policy [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2374.1s)]
*  and so I think we need some things like that coming comminers is [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2377.94s)]
*  Uh enforcing the law against companies the price gouge [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2381.3s)]
*  Which I know she sort of backed away from uh for parts of the campaign was one of those things right where it's like [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2384.5s)]
*  It's not going to pass your brookings test over is it going to solve all the problems blah blah blah [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2389.14s)]
*  But it sent a signal that about who she is and what she would fight for and I think we need to sort of think [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2393.38s)]
*  In some big picture [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2398.42s)]
*  less white papery ideas on how to do this [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2400.5s)]
*  Well, I think they need I think part of it is these ideas need to be paired with [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2404.02s)]
*  um [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2409.46s)]
*  Like who we're holding accountable? [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2410.42s)]
*  um and and [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2412.82s)]
*  Because I think that sometimes it's just like a it's a positive agenda, which is great [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2414.82s)]
*  but I think it feels more urgent and [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2418.58s)]
*  Is more appealing to people when you also talk about how you know [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2422.98s)]
*  These big companies and ceos and everyone are like making money hand over fist and and are more profitable than ever before [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2427.14s)]
*  And so and you're not and and you're still struggling and so we're going to help you blah blah blah and make sure that [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2432.98s)]
*  They're paying their fair share, you know [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2439.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, we need an enemy reporters ask trump whether it's a a conflict of interest to let elon musk [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2441.62s)]
*  Oversee, uh the budgets of agencies that could grant huge contracts to his businesses [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2447.12s)]
*  Uh trump said I don't think so and added I think that elon puts the country long before his company [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2452.42s)]
*  I mean, he's in a lot of companies, but he really is and i've seen it [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2457.62s)]
*  Okay [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2462.34s)]
*  uh [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2463.86s)]
*  You think this matters to people elon's getting to regulate his own businesses and [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2464.66s)]
*  Might some of his budget cuts might affect his biggest competitor nasa like what? [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2469.54s)]
*  I [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2476.02s)]
*  I think there there is a chance that [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2477.3s)]
*  People think elon is so rich that he doesn't care about money they sort of felt that way about trump in some ways [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2479.54s)]
*  But I think that I don't think we should accept that premise of that argument [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2485.1400000000003s)]
*  and [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2488.98s)]
*  I believe that our best argument against trump and republicans is corruption. It's all crap [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2490.02s)]
*  This is so fucking corrupt that the richest man in the world spent over 100 [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2494.34s)]
*  Million dollars to get that on trump like 200 million dollars to get trump elected [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2498.7400000000002s)]
*  And is now going to get billions of dollars in tax cuts and gets to pick the people who regulate his companies [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2502.1800000000003s)]
*  Like tell that story and you can go down the line with all of trump's appointees the people are in and out of government [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2506.7400000000002s)]
*  David sacks who invests in a whole kinds of companies being at the ai and cryptos are [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2513.3s)]
*  All of these things that tell that like this really is, you know [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2518.9s)]
*  I don't know if you listen to rom emanu on ezra's podcast. Um, it's i'm almost taking it [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2522.1800000000003s)]
*  You're taking this it's been out for weeks [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2528.02s)]
*  You're just doing it. I think you told me you were starting doing a lot of stuff [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2530.34s)]
*  Yeah, you just like I love rom can use it. Sorry [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2534.18s)]
*  You're just like I can only take rom in seven minute doses at a time. So it's gonna take basically. Yes 10 days get there [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2537.38s)]
*  Rom use i'm at the part where rom, you know is is talking about the bill clinton 1992 new hampshire [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2542.34s)]
*  Uh, the hits i've taken are nothing like the hits your family's taking i'm like, oh man, we're here now [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2549.46s)]
*  you're about three minutes away from a [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2554.58s)]
*  A obama reference. It's gonna feel equally dated to a lot of people who listen to this podcast. Cool. Cool. Cool. Great, but [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2557.06s)]
*  Rom use the term, uh that the oval office is ebay now that is a that is not the term I would use also so rom [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2562.66s)]
*  That's such a it's it's it's a very it's like a 90s term. Yeah, but there the gala gave him that line [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2568.98s)]
*  Right. That is the image he might have given that line in 1998. Um, but the image that we want to [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2574.98s)]
*  Do that we want to sell is that they are these people are all fucking corrupt [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2582.74s)]
*  That they are all making money hand over fist at your expense. You got all these rich people in there doing it [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2586.58s)]
*  They're getting tax cuts from self. They're picking the regulators [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2591.78s)]
*  They're getting away with stuff you could never get away with and we have if we can tell that story vividly [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2594.5800000000004s)]
*  I think we really do have a chance to reverse the politics on a lot of this [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2599.3s)]
*  Can I just I think there's something that we need to add to the corruption message because [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2603.78s)]
*  I think if you told most americans that uh trump and all of his goons in the white house are uh, [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2608.42s)]
*  Using it to enrich themselves [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2616.1800000000003s)]
*  but also [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2618.82s)]
*  You're getting richer too [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2620.26s)]
*  And your costs are going down or you're getting a tax cut or you're getting something then people be like, yeah [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2622.0200000000004s)]
*  It's not great that they're doing that [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2626.26s)]
*  But honestly kind of figured that was the case when we elected him and and i'm getting like [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2627.38s)]
*  It's it almost goes back to the the famous ad, you know [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2632.98s)]
*  Kamala's for they them and donald trump's for you like we've got to make it seem [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2636.98s)]
*  Which is is is going to be the reality that donald trump and elon musk and all these idiots [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2642.1000000000004s)]
*  They're just there for themselves [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2648.1000000000004s)]
*  They are just there to take care of themselves their businesses their people [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2649.7000000000003s)]
*  And everyone else is getting screwed like that's the corruption. I think that really gets people pissed [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2653.94s)]
*  And not just the like yeah, we're we're making a lot of money. But so are you everyone's making money. It's great [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2659.5400000000004s)]
*  Well, I mean that's where the that's where the prices matter, right? If yes, the corruption message is going to matter more [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2665.38s)]
*  just like people turn [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2670.82s)]
*  Against the wealthy like in occupy wall street they turn against uh [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2672.6600000000003s)]
*  the poor and people on government assistance in times of economic strife and if [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2677.22s)]
*  The prices really don't go down and people continue to be angry to say about the economy [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2683.06s)]
*  They're going to have much less tolerance for these guys fucking throwing parties for themselves in the in the oval office with just [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2686.66s)]
*  Lighting money on fire. Yeah [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2692.74s)]
*  Uh, one of the exchanges that got the most attention was a question about trans rights and so-called bathroom bills [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2694.66s)]
*  The reporters reminded trump that he said in 2016 that trans people should be able to use whatever bathroom they want [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2699.94s)]
*  And asked whether he still felt that way and trump said quote [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2705.2200000000003s)]
*  I don't want to get into the bathroom issue because it's a very small number of people we're talking about and it's ripped apart our [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2708.82s)]
*  Country and he added we're talking about a very small number of people and we're talking about it and it gets massive coverage [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2713.62s)]
*  And it's not a lot of people [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2718.7400000000002s)]
*  Reporters then brought up the house bill to ban sarah mcbride from women's bathrooms [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2720.42s)]
*  But instead of asking whether he supported that bill they asked whether he agreed with sarah that we should focus on bigger issues [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2724.98s)]
*  And he said yes [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2731.3799999999997s)]
*  And then they asked about the anti-trans ad that the campaign ran and he didn't take the bait there either [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2732.66s)]
*  What did you think about his answers on this? [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2737.9399999999996s)]
*  Do you remember in the primary when trump would go to rallies and he would be like [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2741.54s)]
*  Every time I bring up the trans issue you guys all applaud so I keep bringing it up, right? [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2745.8599999999997s)]
*  Like he was sort of mystified by the power of it. Um, well, I just [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2749.62s)]
*  So I think it is something that he has followed the unlike immigration [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2754.8999999999996s)]
*  This is not an issue that has been a long cause of his he just is [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2758.66s)]
*  Sort of following the applause in the room. I think it's fucking gross to say [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2763.14s)]
*  Oh, it doesn't matter [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2766.98s)]
*  Oh, it's not a big issue after you mentioned it all the fucking time on the campaign trail in the most in the grossest most bigoted [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2767.7799999999997s)]
*  way possible [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2772.8999999999996s)]
*  um [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2774.1s)]
*  I generally think [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2775.62s)]
*  He also was probably surprised to be reminded that he said that about bathrooms in [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2777.7s)]
*  2016 or whatever he said that and so he's just now trying to square all the circles in his little head that I was right [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2783.52s)]
*  then i'm right now and then they gave him an obvious out by the way they asked the question about the Sarah McBride question about Sarah McBride statement [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2788.34s)]
*  so we could just [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2795.06s)]
*  uh push it push them both aside and I really not really have to answer I will say like even if [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2796.1800000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump himself [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2802.02s)]
*  Does not want to spend a lot of time focusing on [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2804.02s)]
*  trans rights [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2808.02s)]
*  um [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2809.46s)]
*  And and and not a lot of time, you know beating up on trans people like he did during the campaign [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2810.42s)]
*  cynically, um [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2817.06s)]
*  I do think this is an issue that's going to [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2818.98s)]
*  Come to him and democrats are going to have to still deal with it's not just a oh [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2821.46s)]
*  We're going to argue about it past the campaign [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2825.54s)]
*  We're going to argue about it in the context of the campaign kind of kind of thing [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2828.42s)]
*  um, I spoke to a rolling stone reporter, uh, jel holzman, um, who [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2831.94s)]
*  wrote a [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2838.18s)]
*  Really great piece that everyone should uh, and it's an important piece that everyone should read about how this is going to come up [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2839.86s)]
*  in congress, which is that republicans [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2846.66s)]
*  um want to do a [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2850.26s)]
*  hide like amendment [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2852.82s)]
*  um that will [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2854.98s)]
*  withhold government funding from any health care provider that gets government that gets money from the federal government [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2857.04s)]
*  Um to make sure that they do not provide any gender affirming care [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2864.18s)]
*  So just like now the hide amendment is you know federal money cannot go to any provider any hospital that performs abortions [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2867.86s)]
*  That's why a lot of abortions uh federal that's why a lot of hospitals do not perform abortions [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2875.06s)]
*  Why they're abortion clinics because of the hide amendment and they want to do something like that [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2880.02s)]
*  um for gender affirming care and the question will be [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2886.2599999999998s)]
*  Like do enough democrats [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2891.54s)]
*  Stand up and stop this [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2893.94s)]
*  Um, and I think it could not just be done through reconciliation [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2895.86s)]
*  I think you would need to overcome a filibuster in the senate to actually get this done because that's the same thing with the hide amendment [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2899.46s)]
*  You can't get rid of that through reconciliation either. So you can't just do 51 votes in a budget bill [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2905.78s)]
*  So I think we would have those to stop it, but you could imagine the argument from republicans [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2909.7000000000003s)]
*  And then you can see what trump will do which would be you know, well, no [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2915.78s)]
*  taxpayers shouldn't fund gender affirming care taxpayers shouldn't do this and [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2920.8s)]
*  And [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2924.9s)]
*  What do you think like how do you think democrats respond to that because I think this is one where [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2926.1s)]
*  Fuck the polls on this like we just that is you got to stand up for it [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2930.82s)]
*  And I think what we have to do is figure out a way to [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2935.3s)]
*  Message it so that it is as popular as possible even knowing that it may not be a majority position [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2939.2200000000003s)]
*  And that they might think that this is a wedge issue that that does uh that helps them politically [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2946.58s)]
*  I think and this goes to one of the lessons of how the trans issues played out in the campaign [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2951.4599999999996s)]
*  Which is you have to engage you can't ignore them and you have to engage by going bigger because when you get to the bigger issues [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2957.54s)]
*  of [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2963.7799999999997s)]
*  Human rights and civil rights and treating people with tolerance [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2964.5s)]
*  We have the high side of the argument both morally obviously but also politically and when republicans are able to narrow focus it [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2967.7799999999997s)]
*  around sports teams [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2974.5s)]
*  bathrooms [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2976.56s)]
*  The you know the the taxpayer funded surgeries in the in the infamous ad then [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2978.74s)]
*  They often they often went that and so we should absolutely take it on we should we should it would be [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2984.9799999999996s)]
*  It would be so demoralizing to people in our party if [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2990.5s)]
*  Senate democrats were unwilling to use the filibuster to stand up to protect us [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2994.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and I will say for you know the in the piece, uh holzman [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=2998.8199999999997s)]
*  you know was [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3003.62s)]
*  expressing the concern of a lot of [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3004.9799999999996s)]
*  Activists groups that like maybe you know there's not enough democrats to stand up on this [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3007.2s)]
*  I do think the ones the one silver lining of um [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3012.18s)]
*  Uh the democratic caucus right now in the senate, which is um, you know, it's quite safe [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3015.38s)]
*  It's it's quite safe. It's gonna say yeah, it is it is more we lost mansion. We lost cinema [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3019.7s)]
*  Uh, we also lost the majority but the people left are like mainstream to progressive [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3024.7400000000002s)]
*  You know like we don't have a lot of centrists and and center-right folks in the caucus anymore [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3029.94s)]
*  And so I I do expect that the senators will stand up for that [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3034.7400000000002s)]
*  But it's something but it's something that's coming and people should prepare for it [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3037.86s)]
*  So that they don't just uh, it doesn't surprise everyone and you know [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3040.7400000000002s)]
*  And then just a hundred percent agree that I do maybe maybe this is naive on my part [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3044.5s)]
*  But I do believe that senate democrats would fight would stop this [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3048.5s)]
*  The other thing is what donald trump says on trans issues is also not that important because what you have to really watch is [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3053.6200000000003s)]
*  What's going to happen in his administration? Yes, that's project 2025, which basically [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3058.34s)]
*  Uh compared, uh [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3064.02s)]
*  Being trans to pornography [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3066.66s)]
*  Yeah, and uh, just a series of very dangerous policies are likely to be implemented whether trump wants to have the issue or have the conversation [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3068.5s)]
*  Or not and we're gonna have to fight every single one of those that we can [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3076.58s)]
*  Politically at the ballot box [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3080.9599999999996s)]
*  Legally, etc [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3082.98s)]
*  Well, and this this is an issue that's come up right now even before trump takes office because the defense authorization bill [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3084.18s)]
*  Uh, mike johnson slipped in a provision that says, um [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3089.8599999999997s)]
*  the children of [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3093.06s)]
*  service members [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3095.12s)]
*  Uh are not allowed to get gender affirming care [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3096.34s)]
*  Through the coverage that their parents get by being in the military [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3100.18s)]
*  Most democrats in the house revolted against this obviously we didn't have the votes because the republicans controlled the house [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3103.94s)]
*  so now that goes to the senate and you know, I don't I don't know what's going to happen there, but [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3109.38s)]
*  This is the kind of these are the kind of things that they're going to try to do [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3114.26s)]
*  They're going to try to chip away at it [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3116.66s)]
*  Uh chip away at trans rights and gender affirming care bit by bit [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3118.34s)]
*  And uh, and then I think test democrats to see if they stand up for it [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3122.0200000000004s)]
*  And if they do then say oh see they're still obsessed with the trans issue [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3126.0200000000004s)]
*  They lost on it and they're still obsessed with it. Like that's what they're gonna do [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3128.7400000000002s)]
*  So this is one of the things things there aren't a lot of benefits to be in the minority [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3131.3s)]
*  But one of them is that you can't just do the right thing sometime. Yeah, that is correct. That is correct [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3134.1000000000004s)]
*  um speaking of the uh, the house bathroom bill and its sponsor congresswoman nancy mace of south carolina, um [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3138.5s)]
*  Mace is now set on making sure everyone knows she's the real victim here on tuesday [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3145.54s)]
*  She spoke at an event for foster care providers and alumni in one of the house office buildings [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3149.94s)]
*  This is a wild story a foster care advocate apparently came up to her after she spoke [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3154.9s)]
*  And said something about how uh trans kids need advocacy, too [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3160.34s)]
*  What happened next is disputed but a police report says that this person quote [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3165.2200000000003s)]
*  Began to aggressively and in an exaggerated manner shake her arm up and down in a handshaking motion [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3171.1400000000003s)]
*  Uh, this is the police report was filed by nancy mace and her staff. So this is their side of the story [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3177.94s)]
*  The advocate has pleaded not guilty to misdemeanor assault. Some of the people in the room say they didn't see anything out of the ordinary [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3183.54s)]
*  Just a handshake [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3189.7000000000003s)]
*  Uh, regardless mace is now wearing her arm in a sling and making a big thing of it [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3190.9s)]
*  Publicly reassuring her many fans about her odds of survival and so on [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3196.02s)]
*  Um, she went on benny johnson show sling in full effect, uh to accuse trans people of having a mental illness [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3199.7799999999997s)]
*  If I didn't have a medical degree, I don't know if I would be accusing other people of having a mental illness [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3207.14s)]
*  If I was nancy mace, but that's just me [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3212.34s)]
*  uh [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3214.58s)]
*  What what do you think's going on here? [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3215.54s)]
*  This just like [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3218.74s)]
*  I mean, I guess reporters have um [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3220.18s)]
*  Requested the security footage. So like we're gonna find out what the handshake was like [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3223.3s)]
*  At some point and you know, maybe nancy mace [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3228.82s)]
*  Famous truth-teller is just telling the truth about being assaulted with a violent handshake. It's totally possible nancy mace [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3232.6600000000003s)]
*  um, but it's possible that [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3240.9s)]
*  Uh, it's also possible that maybe she was looking for attention. Who knows nancy mace looking for attention. It's crazy [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3243.0600000000004s)]
*  I know I know I am not accusing her of that. I just want you to know [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3248.98s)]
*  I'm saying it is a possibility that that could be one of the outcomes [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3253.7s)]
*  It is also possible that she that someone came up and asked her a question and violently assaulted her hand [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3257.3s)]
*  By shaking it. That is a common technique for injury is the yeah the old handshake switcheroo. That [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3263.3s)]
*  I've if i've seen it once i've seen it a hundred times stan [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3269.7799999999997s)]
*  I would just say look I I as a person who waits for the facts [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3272.2599999999998s)]
*  I will I anxiously await the security footage to be released probably directly to benny johnson or tucker carlson or someone like that [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3276.34s)]
*  Yeah, it'll be with the january 6 footage that mike johnson has been sitting on that nancy mace has a long history of [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3283.22s)]
*  Stunts to get attention and so this would not be out of line one of her former staffers posted on twitter [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3291.22s)]
*  This is the same woman who told staff myself included during january 6th that she wanted to get punched in the face by a rider [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3298.4199999999996s)]
*  So she could get on tv and be the face of the anti-trump movement [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3306.9799999999996s)]
*  That's what back when she wanted to be part of the anti-trump movement and was so mad at him for the riot on january 6 [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3311.22s)]
*  She wanted to get punched in the face [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3317.3799999999997s)]
*  That story was first reported in the washington post and that's now her former staffer confirming it on twitter. So that's nancy mace [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3321.2999999999997s)]
*  One last thing in the time interview before we go [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3330.02s)]
*  They asked trump all about his thoughts on the campaigns his campaign strategy the campaign in general why he won why harris lost [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3332.42s)]
*  He said his campaign was flawless. He didn't take any days off in the last 72 days [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3340.1s)]
*  He called it he's got a name for it. He said it's called the 72 days of fury [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3344.58s)]
*  He said that he thinks the issue of immigration was a bigger factor in his victory than the economy [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3350.5s)]
*  And that he won because the republican party has become the party of common sense [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3355.62s)]
*  He also said kamala harris's worst mistakes were one taking the assignment because you have to know what you're good at [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3359.7000000000003s)]
*  And two not doing enough interviews [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3366.26s)]
*  Uh, so that's his that's his assessment [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3368.26s)]
*  um [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3371.0600000000004s)]
*  What do you think were we missing anything? Did you did you read that and think maybe I was missing something there? [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3372.42s)]
*  Maybe he's got a point [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3377.46s)]
*  No, I did not I read that whole interview top to bottom and no point without a long interview [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3380.1800000000003s)]
*  And at no point was when I read that I was like, you know what? I know why magazines have fallen down [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3385.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, let me just tell everyone who's listening we're really we're doing it for you here you do not have to go read this interview [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3392.5800000000004s)]
*  We are we're we're basically just an ai bot reading these and telling you the best parts [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3397.8599999999997s)]
*  It is but I read that whole interview and at no point was that like man [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3403.14s)]
*  He's kind of got a point there that did not happen. It's particularly on this part. I'm trying to figure out what the 72 days were [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3406.18s)]
*  Um, I think because kamala harris got in with 107. Oh [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3412.58s)]
*  Maybe it was post debate maybe or post uh post uh dnc [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3417.2999999999997s)]
*  Maybe I don't know maybe or it's a maybe he doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about because he [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3422.98s)]
*  Yeah, i'm gonna go with that one. I'm gonna go with that one [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3426.98s)]
*  I the thing it's now the second time I think that he has said that immigration was a bigger issue than the economy [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3430.26s)]
*  Yeah, and I just think that is something to keep in mind because his actions suggest [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3435.94s)]
*  He does not understand why he was elected and it had a lot more to do with inflation than with immigration immigration was a big [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3440.18s)]
*  Issue i'm not going to take that i'm not going to suggest it wasn't but particularly for a lot of the voters who? [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3445.46s)]
*  Picked him over kamala harris or who moved to him who would vote for biden 20 [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3450.18s)]
*  Inflation was their top issue and if you focus on things other than inflation you will pay a price for that before too long [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3454.18s)]
*  yeah, I do there's something to the [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3459.78s)]
*  People came to believe that the republican party party of common sense [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3462.98s)]
*  Uh, I don't think they think that about the republican party necessarily [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3466.98s)]
*  But they thought that somehow the trump and what he was selling was a little more common sense [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3470.02s)]
*  And I think it's hard to square right because you're like common sense. He seemed fucking nuts and look in exit polls [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3474.58s)]
*  More voters said that he was more extreme than kamala harris [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3481.14s)]
*  Um, so there's that but when he was saying common sense, he was talking about the economy [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3484.98s)]
*  He was talking, you know, he's like people realize that they shouldn't be paying so much for groceries and people think and on immigration [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3490.18s)]
*  Right. Like I do think people probably saw his view on [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3495.86s)]
*  immigration as more common sense than [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3500.56s)]
*  Where the democrats were even though I think I could make an argument [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3503.7s)]
*  That's we're much more common sense on immigration, but I don't think that came through to people [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3508.58s)]
*  We could spend a lot of pods and we will talking about why but I I I do think there's probably some truth to that. I think [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3512.7400000000002s)]
*  the democrats [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3519.86s)]
*  Became the party to some voters of [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3521.3s)]
*  out of touch extremism [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3524.82s)]
*  Yeah, and that is a process that began long before kamala harris was the nominee. It was exacerbated by [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3526.82s)]
*  Um probably our [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3533.86s)]
*  Above all the party sticking with joe biden for a long time [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3535.86s)]
*  It was exacerbated by that the the trans ad we talked about exacerbated by kamala harris saying on the view that there was she couldn't think of any [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3538.58s)]
*  Replace this up. She had nothing would come to mind in terms of where she would differ from biden [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3546.2599999999998s)]
*  But it also has been going on since covet where we have been sort of relentlessly defined out of the mainstream [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3549.86s)]
*  As a party and it doesn't mean that people are fully on board with trump or think he is the party of common sense [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3556.34s)]
*  But I think we seemed a little less in touch with working-class people that made a lot less in touch with working-class people [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3560.9s)]
*  And that's and that's why he won. Yeah [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3567.1400000000003s)]
*  I think it would be fair to say that people perceived us is no longer or less of a party of common sense than [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3568.82s)]
*  Yes, he was more, you know, like yeah, I don't think they did anything to help. No one was a party of common sense, right? [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3575.54s)]
*  Yeah, but we seemed like less less of a party of common sense than maybe we had in the past [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3580.6600000000003s)]
*  So that is and look again, it's not all democrats fault [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3585.1400000000003s)]
*  But you know, we have control over what we say and and how we act and how we approach politics [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3589.2200000000003s)]
*  So something to keep in mind [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3594.6600000000003s)]
*  All right, that's our show for today [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3597.46s)]
*  Tommy love and I will be back with a new show on Tuesday [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3600.6600000000003s)]
*  Everyone have a great weekend. We'll see you later. Bye everyone [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3604.42s)]
*  You [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU1WNFn1LEE&t=3618.26s)]
