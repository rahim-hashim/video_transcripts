Video Description: Donald Trump and Elon Musk make their bromance official in a joint interview with Sean Hannity, but polls suggest the American people may already be souring on DC's new it-couple. Trump takes his feud with Volodymyr Zelenskyy to dangerous new levels, calling Ukraine's leader a "dictator." And, after claiming he wouldn't cut Medicaid, Trump sides with the House GOP on a massive reconciliation bill that would do just that. Jon and Dan discuss how Trump is reshaping our relationship with Russia and the world, the potential political ramifications of cutting entitlements, and the latest with the DOGE firings. Then, Dan is joined by former federal prosecutor Andrew Weissmann to talk about the Justice Department purges, the prospects for the corruption case against Eric Adams, and more.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Donald Trump Suddenly Sides With Putin and Russia, Attacks Zelensky in Stunning Betrayal
**Pod Save America:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0)
*  Welcome to Pod Save America, I'm Jon Favreau. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Dan Pfeiffer. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2.6s)]
*  On today's show, Donald Trump and Elon Musk make their bromance official during a joint [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4.0s)]
*  interview with Sean Hannity, but is the honeymoon over for the American people? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=8.5s)]
*  How's that for a cable-esque tease, Dan? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=12.84s)]
*  That's almost sports radio-esque. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=17.56s)]
*  We'll talk about why these two men are so in love, and why new polling shows problems [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  for both of them. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=26.02s)]
*  Even hours after telling Hannity he'd never support cuts to Medicaid, Trump endorses the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=27.9s)]
*  House budget resolution, which drastically cuts Medicaid, even as Republicans in Congress [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=31.9s)]
*  are starting to squirm about all the doge cuts and firings that are hurting their constituents. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=37.019999999999996s)]
*  And later, Dan talks to former federal prosecutor Andrew Weissman about the purges going on [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=43.18s)]
*  at the Justice Department, the prospects for the corruption case against Eric Adams, and [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=47.66s)]
*  much more. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=51.78s)]
*  But first, I know it's hard to keep up with all the news lately, and that people don't [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=53.62s)]
*  tune into this particular podcast to hear the two of us just riff on global affairs. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=58.76s)]
*  Their mistake, not ours. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  I do think it's important for everyone to understand that this week America has essentially [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=66.97999999999999s)]
*  switched sides in the war between Russia, a repressive, brutal dictatorship, and Ukraine, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=74.1s)]
*  the neighboring democracy that Russia invaded. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=83.02s)]
*  On Tuesday's episode, Tommy and I talked about how Trump and his administration have been [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=86.58s)]
*  speaking about negotiating an end to the war in a way that mass murderer Vladimir Putin [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=91.86s)]
*  couldn't have scripted better himself, including Trump's claim that Ukraine started the war, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=97.82s)]
*  which the whole world knows isn't true, including the vast majority of Americans. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=104.78s)]
*  Putin has said repeatedly that Ukraine isn't a real country, that it belongs to Russia, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=109.58s)]
*  and that Russia wants it back. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=114.22s)]
*  That's why he invaded Crimea in 2014. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=115.74s)]
*  That's why he invaded Ukraine three years ago when Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=118.54s)]
*  gently corrected Trump on this point by telling reporters that he greatly respects President [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=124.62s)]
*  Trump but worries that he lives in a, quote, disinformation space. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=131.14s)]
*  Trump of course lost it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=136.54s)]
*  He posted an angry truth on his way to his beach club in Miami, and here's how he responded. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=139.44s)]
*  He refuses to have elections. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=149.2s)]
*  He's low in the real Ukrainian polls. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=150.84s)]
*  I mean, how can you be high with every city is being demolished? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=154.0s)]
*  It's hard to be high. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=157.0s)]
*  Somebody said, oh no, his polls are good. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=158.64s)]
*  Give me a break. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=160.12s)]
*  A dictator without elections, Zelensky better move faster. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=161.12s)]
*  He's not going to have a country left. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=165.12s)]
*  Got to move. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=166.72s)]
*  Move fast because that war is going in the wrong direction. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=167.72s)]
*  In the meantime, we're successfully negotiating an end to the war with Russia. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=170.96s)]
*  Something I'll admit that only Trump is going to be able to do in the Trump administration. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=176.92s)]
*  We're going to be able to do it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=180.6s)]
*  I think Putin even admitted that. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=182.44s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=184.56s)]
*  That's Trump speaking in Miami at an investment conference organized by Saudi Arabia because [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=187.0s)]
*  of course. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=191.84s)]
*  Then on Thursday in the White House briefing room, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=192.84s)]
*  got this question from Fox News' Peter Ducey. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=197.51999999999998s)]
*  Who does he think is more responsible for the Russian invasion of Ukraine? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=199.92s)]
*  Putin or Zelensky? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=204.76s)]
*  Well, look, his his goal, Peter, is to bring this war to an end. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=206.76s)]
*  Period. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=211.44s)]
*  Some of the rhetoric coming out of Kiev, frankly, and insults to President Trump were unacceptable. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=212.44s)]
*  Who's to say who's to say who's responsible for the Russian invasion of Ukraine? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=218.76s)]
*  It's right there in the question, Dan. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=224.51999999999998s)]
*  It feels like the absolute craziest resistance Russia conspiracies from 2017 have now come true. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=228.28s)]
*  What is your reaction to all this? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=238.0s)]
*  As I do whenever I want to understand what's happening in the world, I listen to Pod Save the World [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=239.88s)]
*  so I can have Tommy and Ben explain it to me. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=243.28s)]
*  And like this obviously felt like a big deal in the moment and seems crazy and insane. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=245.8s)]
*  But I think Ben and Tommy would put it in a perspective that I did not fully comprehend [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=251.2s)]
*  at the beginning of this, which is this is not just the shift between Biden's foreign policy [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=256.24s)]
*  and Trump's foreign policy. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=262.96000000000004s)]
*  This is the abandonment of the entire bipartisan principles that have undergirded US foreign [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=264.48s)]
*  policies since World War II. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=271.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  We have decided that we are no longer a leader in the forces of democracy that we are going [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=274.84000000000003s)]
*  to side with autocracy. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=281.24s)]
*  And that is deeply alarming. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=282.88s)]
*  It is incredibly scary. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=285.32s)]
*  You have the President of the United States not just siding with Putin, but calling Zelensky [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=286.52s)]
*  an unelected dictator and then no one in the administration be willing to say that Putin [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=294.59999999999997s)]
*  not exactly known for free and fair elections to call him for what he is. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=299.15999999999997s)]
*  It is truly insane through the looking glass stuff. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=303.88s)]
*  And it has huge consequences for the United States' role in the world going forward. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=308.76s)]
*  And our safety and security. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=314.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, I'd say when the week started, my anxiety over this was at like a six or seven, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  which is your natural resting state, to be clear. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=321.59999999999997s)]
*  Exactly. Exactly. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=323.44s)]
*  Last few days bumped it up to a nine. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=325.28s)]
*  And honestly, part of that was listening to Pod Save the World, which I know that's a [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=327.84s)]
*  tough plug for Pod Save the World, but you should all listen to this because Ben and [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=332.47999999999996s)]
*  Tommy did an excellent job with this this week. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=335.28s)]
*  And I guess we both we both listen to it before bed. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=337.68s)]
*  Coincidentally, I listen. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=340.08s)]
*  I listen. I I'm more into sleep hygiene than you. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=341.36s)]
*  So I listen to it earlier in the day, but was thinking about it all throughout the rest [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=345.04s)]
*  of the day. OK, OK. Yeah, because I was I was texting you last night when I after I [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=349.68s)]
*  listened to it, I was texting Tommy and Ben and you and being like, that is this scariest [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=354.0s)]
*  fucking thing. Just I'm not here. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=357.52000000000004s)]
*  I'm not here to give you advice. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=359.12s)]
*  But if I were to give you advice, it's just like because I know what your sleep habits [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=360.08000000000004s)]
*  are. It's I would just I'd pick a time right before dinner and say I'm not going to say [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=363.12s)]
*  any more political bogus, even once done by two of my best friends. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=367.36s)]
*  But I've been thinking about it because, you know, we all know the polls. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=371.36s)]
*  We've talked about it. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=375.36s)]
*  You know, do Americans really care about foreign policy and even foreign wars that Americans [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=376.40000000000003s)]
*  aren't fighting in? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=383.84000000000003s)]
*  And what does that have to do with us? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=384.72s)]
*  And why are we are we sending money to Ukraine? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=385.76s)]
*  That's crazy. Well, we should spend more money home. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=387.76s)]
*  And what do we have to care about that? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=389.52000000000004s)]
*  And, you know, the global order and institutions like what does that matter? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=390.72s)]
*  Putin wants to reconstitute the Soviet Union. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=396.48s)]
*  He has for a long time. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=399.36s)]
*  He has nuclear weapons. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=400.8s)]
*  He almost used nuclear weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=402.64s)]
*  We know that from the Biden administration, from what we learned in 2022 and 2023. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=406.72s)]
*  Putin is getting help from North Korea and China to other nuclear armed dictatorships. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=412.56s)]
*  And now he knows that the entire and the entire world knows that the United States, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=419.84000000000003s)]
*  the world's other biggest nuclear power, no longer has any interest in supporting Ukraine, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=425.28s)]
*  doesn't seem to have much interest in supporting Europe either or defending Europe, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=430.96s)]
*  wants to take over Canada, might bomb Mexico, is sending asylum seekers who are escaping [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=436.08s)]
*  persecution from China, Iran, Afghanistan to a camp in a jungle in Panama, another country [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=443.44s)]
*  that Trump is bullying because he wants to take over the Panama Canal. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=454.08s)]
*  And what does all that tell Putin? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=459.2s)]
*  Like, do you think that makes him less likely to invade Europe? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=462.15999999999997s)]
*  Do you think it makes China less likely to invade Taiwan? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=466.32s)]
*  Or like what the whole world now sees the United States and see what Trump has done and thinks [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=471.68s)]
*  and all the bad actors in the world, all the bad regimes, all the nuclear armed regimes are [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=477.2s)]
*  going to say like, well, Donald Trump and the United States aren't going to step in. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=481.44s)]
*  They're looking to take over a bunch of countries themselves. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=485.2s)]
*  So why don't we do whatever the fuck we want? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=487.84s)]
*  And once Trump and his new dictator pals, who all have nuclear weapons, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=490.24s)]
*  have finished carving up the world, do we think that they're just going to relax [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=497.04s)]
*  and leave each other alone? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=502.64s)]
*  Is that how things usually happen? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=504.96s)]
*  When the world order is just a bunch of nuclear powers with fucking lunatics running them [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=507.36s)]
*  who are dictators? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=514.4s)]
*  Like what? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=515.28s)]
*  I mean, what has held the world order together is that you had the strongest military in the [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=516.32s)]
*  world, the United States, on the side of democracy, which puts you on the opposite side of the Soviet [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=524.16s)]
*  Union, then Russia, then China. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=529.2s)]
*  And if the United States leaves that, then the entire balance collapses. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=531.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=537.12s)]
*  Europe, individual European nations, Europe together, NATO without the United States, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=537.44s)]
*  cannot muster the response and certainly does not pose enough of a threat to cause [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=543.44s)]
*  Putin or China or Iran or someone else not to fulfill their ambitions. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=549.6s)]
*  And like the craziest thing, one of the craziest things Trump said this week, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=556.1600000000001s)]
*  and it sort of went under reported in his, I think it was his post about his, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=560.48s)]
*  it was like a readout of his call with Putin or maybe it was about Ukraine. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=565.12s)]
*  I don't know what it was, but he was like, what do we care about this? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=568.72s)]
*  We have a big, beautiful ocean to protect us in between. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=571.52s)]
*  It's like, do you see World War II? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=575.36s)]
*  Do you see any war with boats? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=580.0s)]
*  Any what? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=581.84s)]
*  Like what are you talking about? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=582.64s)]
*  It's fucking 2025. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=584.0s)]
*  It could be fucking 1825. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=586.0s)]
*  People have taken boats to war before. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=588.24s)]
*  How many nuclear weapons could reach the United States? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=588.88s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=591.84s)]
*  You fucking moron. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=593.2s)]
*  It is, it is really bad though. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=595.92s)]
*  And you know, like this whole thing and through the campaign, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=597.84s)]
*  isolationism, America first, we want to turn inward. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=600.72s)]
*  It's not turning inward at all, actually. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=603.36s)]
*  That's the opposite. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=605.2s)]
*  It's Trump going out there and saying, I want to be friends with the other autocrats [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=605.52s)]
*  and the, and who has he bullied? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=610.64s)]
*  He's bullied Canada, Mexico, Denmark, all our allies. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=613.12s)]
*  Germany, J.G. Vance bullied, went to Germany and bullied Germany and tried to like [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=618.8000000000001s)]
*  bolster the far right party in Germany. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=622.64s)]
*  So like, oh, then maybe we can have a far right arm to the teeth Germany. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=625.2s)]
*  That always works well. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=630.72s)]
*  Well, it's also just the fact that the United States is now on the side of [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=631.76s)]
*  the pro-Russian far right parties within European countries like Germany. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=636.64s)]
*  And like, even if that doesn't lead to another world war or nuclear war, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=643.36s)]
*  that leads to a world where millions, billions of people all over the world [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=647.68s)]
*  are brutally repressed because they live under dictatorships and they don't have rights. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=652.56s)]
*  And that's what Vladimir Putin is. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=657.4399999999999s)]
*  And that's what Xi Jinping is. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=658.9599999999999s)]
*  And that's what all of these guys that we've were now in bed with are. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=660.88s)]
*  It's bad. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=665.76s)]
*  It's bad. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=666.4799999999999s)]
*  It also seems like a fair amount of the motivation here is economic. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=667.12s)]
*  In the press briefing, Walt also scolded Zelensky for rejecting a [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=670.0799999999999s)]
*  deal where Ukraine would give us the rights to 50 percent of their rare earth minerals forever [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=674.4s)]
*  in exchange for U.S. support that somehow wouldn't include any security guarantees. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=680.8s)]
*  We talked about this a little bit on Tuesday's pod, but now they're like really mad. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=687.36s)]
*  That's let's get into like, what a deal. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=690.72s)]
*  You give us half of your half of your resources and we'll what? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=692.88s)]
*  Say that we support you. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=697.68s)]
*  We're not going to, you know, militarily support you. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=698.64s)]
*  We won't even invite you to the negotiations about your own country. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=701.4399999999999s)]
*  What kind of a fucking deal is that? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=704.64s)]
*  We also know that the Russian negotiators made, of course, an explicitly capitalist [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=707.1999999999999s)]
*  argument to the American team that American corporations stand to make billions if the [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=712.8s)]
*  U.S. will allow investment in Russia again. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=718.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=720.56s)]
*  So is the new world order also going to be autocrats like Putin and Trump just [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=722.48s)]
*  carving up the world and plundering all the wealth? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=726.0s)]
*  It seems like we're heading that direction. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=729.28s)]
*  I mean, look, in all seriousness, there is a reason that the world order exists as it [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=731.68s)]
*  does. There's a reason there are organizations like NATO. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=737.2s)]
*  There are reasons that there are alliances is that this shit is much harder than Donald [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=739.68s)]
*  Trump thinks it is. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=743.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=744.48s)]
*  Even the United States is safer, more secure, stronger when we are working with other people. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=744.8s)]
*  And even in just this deal that Trump is trying to, I mean, just you couldn't fucking script [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=752.48s)]
*  this with Putin in Saudi Arabia without Ukraine about Ukraine is how is that going to be [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=757.92s)]
*  implemented without Europe? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=762.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=764.7199999999999s)]
*  Who the United States already said they're not going to provide security. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=765.1999999999999s)]
*  So who is going to do that? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=768.0799999999999s)]
*  Trump is going to at some point need these countries for things. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=770.7199999999999s)]
*  They are major U.S. trading partners. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=773.92s)]
*  They are our allies. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=776.0799999999999s)]
*  We are involved in security agreements and intelligence agreements with them all over [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=778.7199999999999s)]
*  the world. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=782.56s)]
*  And so there is Trump puts ahead in one direction, but there is a reality to foreign policy in a [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=783.92s)]
*  complicated interconnected world that is going to make it hard. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=791.84s)]
*  Doesn't mean it can't happen, but it does put challenges into this absurd premise that [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=794.8000000000001s)]
*  trust I do. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=799.36s)]
*  I do just want to say that there is it is not a coincidence that so many rich tech people [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=800.08s)]
*  have adopted this pro-Russian stance over the in recent months and years is because [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=806.64s)]
*  Russia is right that there that is a very large market that U.S. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=812.24s)]
*  companies could be doing business in. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=815.6s)]
*  And that is causing a lot of people to throw aside what they care about to hopefully make a [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=816.8800000000001s)]
*  little bit a little bit more money. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=821.36s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=822.8800000000001s)]
*  And corruption is a is a feature, not a bug of authoritarian regimes. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=823.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=828.8800000000001s)]
*  Like the only thing dictators love as much as they love power is money. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=829.0400000000001s)]
*  And that's why they're all surrounded by oligarchs and they spend all the time stealing [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=833.44s)]
*  from their own people who then hate them. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=837.84s)]
*  And then they repress. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=840.32s)]
*  That seems familiar. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=841.28s)]
*  I can't put my finger on it, but it seems like we've been running to that recently. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=842.24s)]
*  You know what? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=847.36s)]
*  That's a great segue. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=847.92s)]
*  You know, I've read the outline. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=849.92s)]
*  I knew what we were doing. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=851.76s)]
*  You did. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=853.04s)]
*  OK, I'm glad I'm good. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=853.6s)]
*  So nice. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=854.8s)]
*  Donald Trump and Elon Musk sat for a joint interview with Sean Hannity that aired on [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=855.52s)]
*  Tuesday night, which didn't make too much news, but was mostly notable for how nauseating [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=859.36s)]
*  it was to watch. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=865.8399999999999s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=867.04s)]
*  They want you to the start. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=867.8399999999999s)]
*  They want a divorce. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=869.36s)]
*  They want you to to start hating each other. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=870.32s)]
*  Well, I respect him. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=872.72s)]
*  I've always respected him. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=873.6800000000001s)]
*  Well, I love the president. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=875.12s)]
*  I just want to be clear about that. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=875.9200000000001s)]
*  I love the president. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=876.96s)]
*  I think I'm president. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=878.0s)]
*  Trump is a good man. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=878.96s)]
*  That's the way he said that. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=880.4000000000001s)]
*  You know, it's something nice about not once have I seen him do something that was mean [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=881.5200000000001s)]
*  or cruel or or wrong. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=886.24s)]
*  I couldn't find anyone smarter. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=888.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=890.32s)]
*  We settle in this. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=890.6400000000001s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=891.44s)]
*  Yeah, I'm tech support, though. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=893.6s)]
*  But that's it. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=894.72s)]
*  Yes, it done. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=895.0400000000001s)]
*  He's a leader. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=895.6s)]
*  This guy's a very he's a brilliant guy. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=896.4000000000001s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=898.4000000000001s)]
*  He's got tremendous imagination. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=899.2s)]
*  You're much more than a technologist. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=901.2s)]
*  You are that. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=903.44s)]
*  But he's also a good person. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=904.72s)]
*  He's a very good person. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=906.16s)]
*  This is going to be hard. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=907.52s)]
*  I feel like I'm interviewing two brothers here. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=908.48s)]
*  I could get a room. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=911.84s)]
*  You do. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=913.04s)]
*  What did you make of the interview and and their budding relationship? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=915.28s)]
*  It's a phenomenal achievement that Sean Hannity can host an hour long interview [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=920.08s)]
*  with two of the world's most famous and controversial people. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=923.76s)]
*  People famous for saying interesting, crazy, insane things and have that interview make [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=926.48s)]
*  no news. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=933.12s)]
*  You said not much news. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=933.6s)]
*  No news. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=935.04s)]
*  It was ungodly boring. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=936.08s)]
*  It was like watching wallpaper dry on the wall. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=938.64s)]
*  It was so boring. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=941.28s)]
*  I just like the fact that he pulled that off. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=942.08s)]
*  Did he? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=944.4s)]
*  I just can't even imagine how that even happened. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=946.4s)]
*  Like Donald Trump has never sat for an hour without saying something interesting before. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=948.5600000000001s)]
*  Elon Musk never sat for an hour without saying something controversial or angry. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=951.12s)]
*  Just truly mind-numbingly boring and stupid. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=954.96s)]
*  As for the relationship, maybe they like each other. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=959.36s)]
*  Maybe they do. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=962.24s)]
*  It seemed like who am I to say? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=963.28s)]
*  I don't play psychologist here, but I don't think Donald Trump is not exactly known for [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=964.88s)]
*  hiding his feelings. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=968.64s)]
*  He can barely look at JD Vance when they're in a room together. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=969.6s)]
*  He can never even... [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=971.84s)]
*  It's clear he cannot stomach Mike Pence at all. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=973.1999999999999s)]
*  I thought he was just a huge goober. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=975.84s)]
*  Or his wife. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=977.92s)]
*  His own wife. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=980.48s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=981.76s)]
*  Yeah, sorry. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=982.4s)]
*  I forget Mike Pence's wife. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=982.96s)]
*  I thought you meant Kara Pence. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=984.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=984.96s)]
*  No, no. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=985.44s)]
*  It definitely doesn't like her. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=985.92s)]
*  But no, he doesn't even like Melania. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=986.88s)]
*  It's... [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=989.44s)]
*  I mean, maybe they do. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=990.16s)]
*  It is... [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=990.96s)]
*  Elon Musk is one of the few people in the world who Trump needs more than they need Trump. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=993.44s)]
*  Right? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1000.0s)]
*  He's got... [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1000.24s)]
*  He spent a quarter billion dollars to get him elected. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1000.64s)]
*  He has this cudgel for Trump as he tries to implement his policy because [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1004.32s)]
*  Musk keeps saying he'll fund primaries against people who don't vote for his nominees. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1009.6800000000001s)]
*  That clearly was quite effective since the earlier... [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1013.9200000000001s)]
*  On Thursday, we confirmed Cash Patel as FBI director. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1017.0400000000001s)]
*  So anything goes. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1020.08s)]
*  And Elon Musk controls his favorite social media platform. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1022.72s)]
*  And so I don't know if they really like each other or not, but Trump is not... [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1026.88s)]
*  He is more forgiving of Musk or more willing to tolerate him than he is anyone else. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1031.6s)]
*  I... [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1037.76s)]
*  My main takeaway from the interview besides, yes, that it was boring. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1038.56s)]
*  Yes, that Sean Hannity somehow managed to sit for an hour with these two and never [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1043.2s)]
*  brought up anything interesting. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1049.28s)]
*  It was just a love fest the entire time. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1050.96s)]
*  And it was nauseating to watch. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1053.44s)]
*  But as I watched it, I was like, I think I was completely wrong about... [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1054.64s)]
*  And I think all of us were wrong about all of the guesses about this relationship and like, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1058.88s)]
*  when's the divorce coming? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1064.64s)]
*  When is the falling out? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1066.3200000000002s)]
*  And like, I think you're right that Trump needs Elon and uses Elon, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1067.92s)]
*  but Trump needs and uses a lot of people and doesn't love them. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1072.4s)]
*  Or doesn't even like them or doesn't show that kind of affection for them. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1077.04s)]
*  I think they genuinely like each other because they're just... [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1080.8000000000002s)]
*  They're kindred spirits. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1083.92s)]
*  Like, Trump in his first term was extremely frustrated that he couldn't do whatever he wanted. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1086.16s)]
*  You know, it was lawyers and his advisors and people in the federal government telling him, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1092.8000000000002s)]
*  no, or this is against the law, or this is a bad idea, whatever. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1098.88s)]
*  And now he's got another famous rich dude, authoritarian, who doesn't care about laws, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1102.24s)]
*  doesn't care about other people's opinions, thinks he knows everything, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1110.64s)]
*  and is willing to be his enforcer. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1114.5600000000002s)]
*  And that's what he needed, right? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1117.8400000000001s)]
*  No one else has been able to take what Donald Trump wants to do, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1120.0s)]
*  much of it illegal, much of it corrupt, and do it for him. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1125.3600000000001s)]
*  And I think the reason that Elon does it is because he's been radicalized. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1129.3600000000001s)]
*  He craves attention. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1134.24s)]
*  He craves recognition. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1135.92s)]
*  Wants to be even richer and more powerful. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1138.4s)]
*  And, you know, of course, also he confuses attention and recognition. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1142.0800000000002s)]
*  And both of them, both of them do, both of them have this like, this deep, bottomless need [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1148.88s)]
*  to be loved. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1155.2s)]
*  And they can't get it. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1157.2s)]
*  And neither of them are truly happy until they just keep wanting, wanting, wanting. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1158.96s)]
*  They want more money, more power. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1164.4s)]
*  And they found a kindred spirit in each other. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1166.24s)]
*  I think they genuinely like each other. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1168.4s)]
*  It's interesting because, like you point out, they're very, very similar people. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1170.0800000000002s)]
*  And usually two people are exactly the same, particularly powerful people, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1173.76s)]
*  butt heads immediately. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1177.12s)]
*  Because you can see in the other person what you subconsciously don't like about yourself. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1178.6399999999999s)]
*  But that doesn't seem to be the case here. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1183.84s)]
*  And I think maybe with Trump, it is he respects two things more than anything else. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1185.04s)]
*  Money and attention or fame. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1190.32s)]
*  And Elon Musk has more of both than any other person on the planet. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1193.44s)]
*  He's the only person. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1196.0s)]
*  Very good point. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1196.96s)]
*  Especially good point on the attention. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1197.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1198.96s)]
*  He's the only, that is why, I agree with you that they genuinely like each other. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1199.76s)]
*  But even if they didn't, it's one of the reasons why Trump is, I do not think a divorce is coming [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1204.16s)]
*  is because if they're the only person on the planet that Trump would probably be worried [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1208.48s)]
*  to get into a online spat with would be Musk. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1212.64s)]
*  He controls Twitter. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1216.88s)]
*  He gets more attention. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1218.0s)]
*  He is better at it. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1219.2s)]
*  And like he is, he is, no one else has a megaphone as big as Trump's with the possible exception [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1220.72s)]
*  of Elon Musk. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1225.2s)]
*  Small thing. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1226.3200000000002s)]
*  But at one point, I think we played the beginning of it in the clip, which is when [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1226.96s)]
*  Hannity's like, oh, they're trying to get, they're trying to drive a wedge between you two. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1231.04s)]
*  And Trump responds by saying like, I know I saw that. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1234.8s)]
*  He's like, it's so, because they're so bad at it. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1238.32s)]
*  Democrats are so bad at it. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1240.48s)]
*  I used to think they were good at it. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1241.76s)]

*  He was even like about 15 points lower than Joe Biden. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1617.76s)]
*  At the same point, he is the only modern [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1622.16s)]
*  president with lower approval ratings at the outset of the presidency than Donald Trump in 2025. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1625.6000000000001s)]
*  It's Donald Trump in 2017. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1630.96s)]
*  But having said that, it is the direction of the polls is very clear. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1633.3600000000001s)]
*  He is now back. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1638.3200000000002s)]
*  He's back to mid 40s, which was in most of these polls, which is where he was, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1640.0s)]
*  that's sort of his, sort of his, the high end of his range for much of his first term. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1646.48s)]
*  And there are three reasons for this. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1652.4s)]
*  And they're pretty clear in the polling. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1653.76s)]
*  One issue pointed out is the economy. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1655.68s)]
*  His economic approval rating in the Reuters poll has dropped to 39. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1657.52s)]
*  It has dropped significantly over the last month. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1660.08s)]
*  You saw this in the CBS poll that two thirds of voters thought he wasn't focused enough [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1662.24s)]
*  on lowering prices. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1666.24s)]
*  The second reason is people don't like his agenda. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1669.44s)]
*  You have majorities who in the Washington Post poll who do not agree with what he's been doing. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1674.24s)]
*  And that makes complete sense. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1680.56s)]
*  He ran on lowering prices and securing the border, but all of the news is about slashing [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1682.16s)]
*  government, weaponization, and cozying up to Putin, all of these things. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1688.0s)]
*  And it's like presidents get in trouble when they campaign on one agenda and govern on another. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1691.92s)]
*  And he campaigned as it was bullshit, but he campaigned as a populist who wanted to fight [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1697.2s)]
*  for the working class. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1703.2s)]
*  He's governing it on a Medicaid cutting government slashing austerity agenda. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1704.0800000000002s)]
*  That's not what people voted for in that sort of game. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1708.72s)]
*  The last thing is that Elon Musk is dragging him down in some ways. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1710.8799999999999s)]
*  And one of the more interesting things is Elon Musk's favorability ratings are fine. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1713.68s)]
*  44. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1718.32s)]
*  It's not great, but he's actually more popular than just about every politician who's not [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1718.8s)]
*  named Barack Obama right now in Donald Trump. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1723.6s)]
*  But the better question to ask is do you approve of the job he's doing? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1727.52s)]
*  Because the favorability rating includes, do you like him? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1731.04s)]
*  Seems highly unlikely. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1734.08s)]
*  But what do you like? [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1735.2s)]
*  But also all the Tesla, SpaceX, everything he's accomplished for the world and the planet, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1736.24s)]
*  which some of it is quite good. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1741.1200000000001s)]
*  When you ask, is he doing, do you approve of how he's doing his job in government? [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1744.08s)]
*  Only 34% of people in the Washington Post approve of him. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1749.2s)]
*  They had quotes from some of the respondents in the Washington Post poll about why they [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1751.84s)]
*  supported Trump or opposed him or whatever. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1757.92s)]
*  And I saw one woman who voted for Trump said, Elon's a smart guy. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1759.92s)]
*  And I think he's really smart with his companies. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1765.84s)]
*  But I really don't like what he's doing, cutting all these programs. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1768.24s)]
*  He's got too much influence in there. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1770.8799999999999s)]
*  And you see that in like 26% in the Washington Post poll, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1773.12s)]
*  support approve of Elon Musk shutting down federal agencies and 52% oppose. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1778.8799999999999s)]
*  You have six in 10 people who think you are concerned that Elon Musk and the Doge team [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1783.12s)]
*  having access to sensitive personal information. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1786.72s)]
*  Elon Musk is a political, he is helping Trump accomplish his agenda, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1789.36s)]
*  but he is hurting him politically and how he's doing it because the agenda he's accomplishing [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1794.24s)]
*  is unpopular. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1797.76s)]
*  It's not what people voted for, it's not what they want. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1798.72s)]
*  I think there's also something instructive in all these numbers for [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1800.32s)]
*  Democrats and anyone trying to oppose Trump right now and wondering what we should do [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1804.48s)]
*  and does anything matter? [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1809.36s)]
*  Which is like when you ask people, there's been some analysis that Trump's approval ratings, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1810.72s)]
*  at least for the last couple of weeks, have been relatively high, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1816.56s)]
*  partly because he's taken action and he's doing stuff. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1819.44s)]
*  And people like presidents who take action. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1823.12s)]
*  And I think that's right, that analysis is correct. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1826.3999999999999s)]
*  And when you ask people, oh, well, what do you think about him making government more efficient? [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1829.12s)]
*  People like the idea of making government more efficient. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1834.6399999999999s)]
*  They, unfortunately, you know, a slight majority likes the deportation agenda. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1837.6s)]
*  That's also because they think he is deporting undocumented immigrants with criminal records, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1843.9199999999998s)]
*  which he is clearly, that is only a small portion of the immigrants he's deporting. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1849.76s)]
*  We can talk about that some other time. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1855.12s)]
*  But when you get into the programs he's cutting, what Elon is doing, even with something like USAID, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1857.92s)]
*  when we talked about this, six in 10 oppose closing USAID, even when it's talked about like that, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1865.68s)]
*  just, you know, which has now become famous. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1872.32s)]
*  The reporting around Doge, what Elon has been up to, what the Doge bags have been up to, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1874.4s)]
*  the cuts, the firings, and what Democrats have been saying about this and the noise that people [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1882.3200000000002s)]
*  have been making just across the country about this. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1888.48s)]
*  I think it is, it's breaking through and people are hearing it. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1891.3600000000001s)]
*  And so we're starting to see it in the polling that yes, maybe people liked him taking action. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1895.2s)]
*  And yes, they want government to be more efficient. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1901.1200000000001s)]
*  But the way that they're seeing it happen, they despise. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1903.36s)]
*  And just as a point, and this is a good, if we continue on the right trend, this could go down [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1907.12s)]
*  as one of the great political miscalculations in history is let's say Donald Trump had put Russell [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1912.3999999999999s)]
*  vote in charge of Doge. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1917.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's interesting. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1920.0s)]
*  No one would know. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1921.52s)]
*  But because they put a person who gets more attention than almost anyone else on the planet [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1923.04s)]
*  in charge of implementing the popular agenda, people know about the unpopular agenda. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1928.32s)]
*  Elon Musk is a figure and this is sort of how the media environment works. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1932.72s)]
*  This is if you have people who are controversial, who you talk about, and then you get engagement, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1936.0s)]
*  you create this incentive structure for more and more people to talk about it. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1942.08s)]
*  No one is getting more TikTok views or ex reposts or whatever you call them or skeets or whatever [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1945.04s)]
*  else talking about Russell vote or Kevin Hassett, the NEC director, anything like that. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1952.0s)]
*  But if you put a huge, giant, famous celebrity who loves attention in charge of doing things [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1957.44s)]
*  that you probably wish people did not know, you're probably going to suffer politically [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1962.96s)]
*  from that down the line. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1966.88s)]
*  Who has the one of the biggest megaphones in the world and is literally narrating what he's [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1969.1200000000001s)]
*  doing minute by minute, including many of his fuck ups. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1974.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1979.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1979.8400000000001s)]
*  I mean, it is a wild choice. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1980.24s)]
*  Which is, and I know you wrote another message box on this, like whether it's the right strategy [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1983.44s)]
*  for Democrats to focus on Elon Musk. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1987.92s)]
*  I say yes. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1990.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1992.4s)]
*  I mean, that's the conclusion you came to as well, but I don't see any downside to this. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1992.5600000000002s)]
*  I think you have to do it in the right way. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1997.5200000000002s)]
*  The reason you have to do it is we can't get attention for our message. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=1999.92s)]
*  We have to go where there is attention. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2002.96s)]
*  We can't make attention. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2005.68s)]
*  We have to go get it. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2007.0400000000002s)]
*  And it is with Elon. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2007.92s)]
*  Democrats have been attacking Donald Trump for a decade now. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2009.1200000000001s)]
*  That is not in and of itself news and interesting. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2012.08s)]
*  If you attack Elon Musk, you're going to get more attention. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2014.1599999999999s)]
*  I do think it's important to weave it into a larger narrative and not just simply calling [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2016.3999999999999s)]
*  Elon Musk a dick. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2022.1599999999999s)]
*  Although it was quite funny when Robert Garcia did that. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2023.1999999999998s)]
*  That's not exactly what we have to do here. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2026.3999999999999s)]
*  We have to make Elon Musk be a data point in a larger story. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2027.6s)]
*  And that's just about Trump because barring a dramatic change to the Constitution, he's [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2030.3999999999999s)]
*  not running again, but about the Republican Party that's going along with this, right? [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2035.12s)]
*  The corruption about the influence of the world's richest man rooting around in our [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2038.48s)]
*  government affecting agencies that are investigating his or regulating his companies. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2043.04s)]
*  It has to be part of a larger story about corruption because the polls show that people [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2047.2s)]
*  are very concerned about the influence of corporations, billionaires, and Elon Musk [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2050.7999999999997s)]
*  specifically. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2055.2s)]
*  And so we shouldn't make that part of the story. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2055.7599999999998s)]
*  And how it's affecting you. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2057.36s)]
*  And like, you know, he's destroying jobs and he's breaking government services that [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2058.64s)]

*  Trump and the relationship and all that kind of stuff. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2072.64s)]
*  And it's just it's a it's a little bit of a sideshow because I think what's going to [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2074.7999999999997s)]

*  880 billion dollars. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2165.52s)]

*  I would just want to focus on the NIH one for a second. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2171.28s)]
*  I saw a post social media about this, which is the most impactful and innovative research [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2174.7200000000003s)]

*  They're making real progress with therapeutic drugs in recent years and could be close to [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2181.92s)]
*  some sort of treatment or cure. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2187.84s)]
*  The way it was described was basically cutting funding for the NIH right now is like taking [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2190.4s)]
*  away your kid's bike the day the training wheels come off just after someone told you [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2198.0800000000004s)]
*  that they have the possibility of entering the Olympics. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2201.52s)]
*  It's like we're close to doing something and you're gutting it and all of these things [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2204.88s)]
*  do matter and they do break through to people because they're basically finding something [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2208.88s)]
*  that every person in America cares about. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2213.44s)]
*  They everyone cares about different things, but and then cutting it and affecting it. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2214.96s)]
*  Why are they doing this? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2219.76s)]
*  Not I can't possibly fathom. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2220.88s)]
*  You just have a bunch of people who know nothing about government who don't seem to care about [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2222.96s)]
*  people who view government as the enemy trying to just meet some number of fired employees, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2228.48s)]
*  budget cuts without really thinking in any holistic way about how you actually help people [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2236.48s)]
*  because they don't think government should help people. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2241.04s)]
*  That's not what they believe. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2242.48s)]
*  We have seen this to a lesser degree in when George W. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2244.2400000000002s)]
*  Bush was president and he got he put a bunch of hacks in at FEMA and Katrina happened. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2247.44s)]
*  We are in dangerous territory and this is what happens when people who hate government are in [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2254.72s)]
*  charge of government. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2258.0s)]
*  The Medicaid thing is going to be a huge problem for them because either they don't touch Medicaid [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2259.04s)]
*  like Trump said on Hannity, which means that if they don't touch Medicaid and they're not [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2264.0s)]
*  going to touch Medicare or Social Security and they're going to add to defense spending, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2270.8s)]
*  there's just not enough money to cut anything else and also pay for a $4.5 trillion tax cut. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2276.08s)]
*  Basically, then you get down to drastic cuts to all the other spending in government, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2281.6800000000003s)]
*  food inspection, NIH, healthcare, all this other stuff. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2290.0s)]
*  You still have just you just add a huge, huge amount to the deficit because you just give [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2294.6400000000003s)]
*  a huge tax cut to rich people. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2299.76s)]
*  So that's one option. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2301.1200000000003s)]
*  The other option is an $880 billion cut to Medicaid, which is what is in the House [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2304.0s)]
*  Republican budget that Trump endorsed. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2309.44s)]
*  They talk about work requirements and, okay, well, if you get Medicaid, you should work. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2312.64s)]
*  Now, that's kind of bullshit because work requirements end up. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2318.0s)]
*  What happens when you institute work requirements in a state that is giving people Medicaid [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2323.28s)]
*  is you end up just a lot of people lose their coverage. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2327.76s)]
*  It's not like they're not working because they don't want to work. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2330.64s)]
*  A lot of times they're not working because they can't work. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2334.08s)]
*  Regardless, if you instituted work requirements, it would save you about $100 billion in [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2339.52s)]
*  Medicare. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2344.56s)]
*  Okay, so they want $880 billion. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2345.04s)]
*  So you still get $780 billion to go. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2347.68s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2349.84s)]
*  Medicare covers 72 million Americans. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2350.56s)]
*  It covers nearly half of all births in this country. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2355.2000000000003s)]
*  Half, two thirds of all nursing home stays. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2358.4s)]
*  Working class people who are just above the poverty line are on Medicaid. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2362.16s)]
*  And so you start, and by the way, a lot of these people who are on Medicaid, probably [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2367.12s)]
*  most of the people who are on Medicaid now are in red states and are Trump voters, which [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2372.9599999999996s)]
*  is why Steve Bannon's out there saying, why would we cut Medicaid? [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2378.64s)]
*  We can't cut Medicaid. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2382.08s)]
*  And they're going to have problems both on their right flank, I think, cutting Medicaid [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2383.6s)]
*  among some of the like the populace like Bannon. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2389.2s)]
*  And they're going to have a ton of problems. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2392.7999999999997s)]
*  They already are with Republicans, House Republicans and Senate Republicans who were [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2394.4s)]
*  in vulnerable districts and states in 2026. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2398.96s)]
*  So I don't know how they're going to get all the math done here and get all these [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2403.6s)]
*  cuts done because you start, you cut 780 billion, 880 billion from Medicaid. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2407.92s)]
*  You are throwing millions and millions of people off their healthcare. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2413.76s)]
*  I mean, it's a politically insane thing to do and how they get it done. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2416.96s)]
*  I mean, the most likely scenario is it has passed the whole thing. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2421.04s)]
*  One way which they can do is they just pass it with no pay-fors. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2424.08s)]
*  You can do some things on how they do the CBO scoring, the congressional budget office [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2427.12s)]
*  scoring to make it seem less added to the deficit. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2430.7200000000003s)]
*  And you can make it nine years instead of 10 years. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2433.84s)]
*  You can have the budget when there's all this nerdy stuff you can do. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2436.08s)]
*  It's still unpaid for. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2437.92s)]
*  It's all gimmicks and lies. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2439.44s)]
*  But can they get House Freedom Caucus members who are demanding trillions of dollars and [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2441.76s)]
*  cuts to go for that? [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2445.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2446.88s)]
*  Maybe, maybe Trump just is like, do it or else Elon Musk will fund a primary challenge [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2447.6s)]
*  and I'll send my pardon January 6th goons after you. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2452.4s)]
*  Well, he got them last time, right? [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2455.28s)]
*  He did get them to do this. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2456.8s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2458.0s)]
*  This is how things played out in 2017 when they passed their tax cut. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2458.56s)]
*  Now it's a much narrower majority now. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2463.04s)]
*  You can lose by the time this happens three people probably. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2465.44s)]
*  But it's fascinating that they are taking on this sort of truly insane thing to do. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2470.08s)]
*  It's even more insane now that the Republican Party is branding itself as this multi-racial [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2478.2400000000002s)]
*  working class coalition that you're going to kick most a lot of your coalition off health care. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2482.4s)]
*  It's actually probably it is by the numbers way worse politics than repealing Obamacare. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2487.04s)]
*  Way worse. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2493.84s)]
*  It's more people for more things and more parts of the country. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2494.7200000000003s)]
*  And Bannon gets it and like Josh Hawley gets it. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2498.1600000000003s)]
*  But then I guess they were in their their Senate caucus meeting and Ted Cruz was like [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2501.84s)]
*  Medicaid cuts must be on the table. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2505.92s)]
*  And there was like a lot of applause because it's still a lot of still Paul [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2507.84s)]
*  Ryan's party and I bet I bet we're going to see Elon Musk tweeting about how we need to [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2511.6s)]
*  gut Medicaid fraud in Medicaid so much. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2517.36s)]
*  Oh it's gonna be a whole thing. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2519.6s)]
*  I mean he's already doing it on Social Security so I don't think that's going to help their [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2520.96s)]
*  cause either. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2524.4s)]
*  One thing that might help their popularity is the idea they're floating now to take [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2526.48s)]
*  some of the savings that Doge is allegedly making and return that money to taxpayers [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2531.6s)]
*  in the form of tax refunds or checks or something. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2537.6s)]
*  There's this idea floating around that they take 20 percent of the savings the Doge [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2540.3199999999997s)]
*  savings and they they use it to pay down the deficit. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2544.3999999999996s)]
*  They take another 20 percent and they and they hand out refunds to everyone a five thousand [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2547.4399999999996s)]
*  dollar checks a five thousand dollar check for every family. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2552.08s)]
*  What do you make of that proposal? [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2556.24s)]
*  It seems like it's probably great politics. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2558.08s)]
*  It seems like Trump is going to love it because he loves sending checks to people like in his [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2561.12s)]
*  somewhat simplistic brain. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2566.96s)]
*  Just giving people money means that they'll support you. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2568.6400000000003s)]
*  So I think he would like it. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2571.6000000000004s)]
*  I think there are some real challenges to doing it. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2572.7200000000003s)]
*  One almost certainly would increase inflation. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2575.52s)]
*  So that's one. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2580.0800000000004s)]
*  Although Kevin Hassett who is an economist I believe and Trump's economic advisor said [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2580.88s)]
*  it would not which means he should have to turn in his because he said if you give people [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2585.44s)]
*  money they'll spend it. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2589.2000000000003s)]
*  It's like yeah yeah that's yeah that's that you're overheating the economy. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2590.0s)]
*  So that's one to Mike Johnson speaker of the house today said that it was essentially said [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2595.92s)]
*  it was a nonstarter for him because his caucus wants to that's more spending right. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2601.36s)]
*  He wants to take those things. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2606.2400000000002s)]
*  He's doing the math to get to get to five thousand dollars of family right. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2607.6s)]
*  And first of all they cut out everyone who doesn't pay income taxes which is 40 percent [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2612.2400000000002s)]
*  of people in the country right. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2615.52s)]
*  So then you're given five thousand dollars and it basically it's four hundred billion [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2617.44s)]
*  dollars is 20 percent of the trillion that they're thinking they're going to save in [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2621.52s)]
*  spending cuts. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2625.36s)]
*  But first of all Doge has saved a couple billion so far. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2626.0s)]
*  So the idea that they're going to get from a couple billion to a trillion and then give [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2630.48s)]
*  everyone a rebate seems a little fanciful. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2634.0s)]
*  But I wouldn't be surprised if at the end of the day the tax cut package includes some [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2637.92s)]
*  something that they call a Doge rebate that is some number much smaller than five thousand [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2644.0s)]
*  dollars that Donald Trump and Elon Musk both signed together with hearts over their eyes [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2649.04s)]
*  and their names and then well you're never this is what George W. Bush did in the 2001 [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2653.84s)]
*  tax cut. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2657.92s)]
*  He sent people to us. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2658.64s)]
*  It's too appealing to Donald Trump and to Elon Musk to avoid. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2660.16s)]
*  So I could see some version of it ending up in the final but it's certainly not five thousand [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2664.32s)]
*  dollar checks and they're certainly not finding a trillion dollars in Doge cuts that aren't [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2668.72s)]
*  incredibly unpopular. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2672.4s)]
*  Yeah that's right. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2673.84s)]
*  All right one more thing before we go to your interview with Andrew Weissman. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2675.04s)]
*  Right before we were recording Elon Musk did take the stage at CPAC and he didn't make a [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2679.44s)]
*  lot of news but the appearance was so special that I asked the team to put together some [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2687.6s)]
*  highlights so that you and I could react to them in real time for the first time. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2696.08s)]
*  Have you seen any of this? [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2700.88s)]
*  I caught like one part of it maybe but I was rushing and I just told Saul you give us the [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2702.48s)]
*  supercut and Dan and I will react. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2708.48s)]
*  Yeah I was doing the Andrew Weissman interview immediately before we recorded and I learned [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2712.08s)]
*  about his appearance not long ago. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2715.92s)]
*  So cool. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2718.72s)]
*  Let's do this. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2719.2s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2719.68s)]
*  This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2720.32s)]
*  In Europe they put people in prison for memes. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2726.32s)]
*  Yeah we want to go see it and just make sure like somebody did a spray paint some letters [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2728.88s)]
*  of them you know. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2732.0s)]
*  Yeah like is this real gold? [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2732.56s)]
*  We're fighting the matrix big time here. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2736.08s)]
*  Legalize comedy. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2738.0s)]
*  I am become meme. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2739.44s)]
*  What is it like inside your mind? [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2741.92s)]
*  I mean my mind is a storm. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2743.6s)]
*  So it's a storm. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2746.48s)]
*  So he walked out Dan he's got sunglasses on indoors and a heavy gold chain and he's holding [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2749.2000000000003s)]
*  a chainsaw. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2757.04s)]
*  I don't think he was okay. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2760.48s)]
*  He seemed really he seemed to kind of fucked up. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2761.6s)]
*  I don't know if he was just a little little punchy little silly but he wasn't making much [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2765.28s)]
*  sense. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2770.4s)]
*  Something else that happened while he's on stage literally while he's walking out with [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2771.76s)]
*  the chainsaw there is a tweet from Grimes replying to Elon and it says Grimes is a mother [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2775.6s)]
*  of his some of his children. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2783.84s)]
*  Please respond about our child's medical crisis. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2786.96s)]
*  I am sorry to do this publicly but it is no longer acceptable to ignore the situation. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2789.52s)]
*  This requires immediate attention. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2793.84s)]
*  If you don't want to talk to me can you please designate or hire someone who can so that [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2795.6800000000003s)]

*  That's heartbreaking. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2800.8s)]
*  Dark. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2802.32s)]
*  Dark and this is now the second mother of his children this week that has reached out [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2804.0s)]
*  to him on his platform. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2810.8s)]
*  Ashley St. Claire apparently is fathering his fathered a child with her. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2813.52s)]

*  I was going to say I don't need to talk about them and also I couldn't even if I wanted [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2820.64s)]
*  to because it's too complicated to understand. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2824.8799999999997s)]
*  But this is what was happening while he was out on stage talking about how he is meme [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2827.52s)]
*  and we should legalize comedy and he's yelling and he's talking about his mind and going [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2834.4799999999996s)]
*  to the this whole thing now that he and Trump have about going to Fort Knox to make sure [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=2839.3599999999997s)]

*  So arts as well. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3021.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3024.32s)]
*  Andrew let's start with the shakeups of the Department of Justice this week Trump ordered [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3024.56s)]
*  the firing of all the Biden area US attorneys saying the department is too politicized. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3030.16s)]
*  This has caused quite an outcry and levels of concern from people out there. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3035.36s)]
*  Is this normal? [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3042.2400000000002s)]
*  Is it concerning to you? [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3043.28s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3045.04s)]
*  So of all the things that have gone on the all the actions of the FBI the Eric Adams case the [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3046.56s)]
*  resignation of the chief of the criminal division in the DCU attorney's attorney's office [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3054.64s)]
*  all of that as well as the statements being made and by a male bovey and all of [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3061.12s)]
*  Pam bondy's sort of day one memos at the bottom of the list is asking the presidential appointed [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3068.0s)]
*  US attorneys to resign. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3078.24s)]
*  So that is fairly standard. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3080.72s)]
*  It's not standard the way it's done. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3083.44s)]
*  I mean it's it's usually not sort of as abrupt and it's not talking about [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3086.16s)]
*  weaponization and politicization. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3091.04s)]
*  Um the US attorneys typically typically do change over when there's a change in party control. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3093.7599999999998s)]
*  So that's not that's the least of it in in my book. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3103.44s)]
*  You know when if I remember this correctly when Obama came in in 2009 and he did the same thing [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3106.8s)]
*  as other previous presidents have done he did leave in place the North the bush appointed North [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3112.4s)]
*  Carolina US attorney because that US attorney was in the midst of investigating Democratic [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3118.48s)]
*  presidential candidate John Edwards and he didn't want to seem like he was interfering with that. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3123.36s)]
*  Are there any open cases or investigations here that could be affected by these firings? [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3127.12s)]
*  So the answer is yes but we already have we have bigger problems exactly we have so many [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3133.2s)]
*  other things that are are going on. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3141.6s)]
*  I mean those kinds of wonderful norms let's just start with President Obama brought in [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3144.24s)]
*  the new US attorneys and what he told them is I know that I have nominated you and the [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3151.3599999999997s)]
*  Senate confirms you but you need to understand your allegiance is to the Constitution not to me. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3156.72s)]
*  That is which of course is like any fourth grader would understand that that's the way [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3164.64s)]
*  it's supposed to work except that in the world we're in that needs to be retaught because that's [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3171.52s)]
*  the opposite of what Donald Trump in my view wants he wants it first to be you are loyal to me. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3176.88s)]
*  Well that's a great segue into the Eric Adams case this is I listened to your whole podcast [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3184.24s)]
*  on this on major messages was fabulous and we could have a whole podcast conversation about it but [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3189.12s)]
*  could you at least explain give the short version to our listeners what happened here and why this [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3193.7599999999998s)]
*  was such an unusual decision and process from the Department of Justice. Sure Mayor Adams is [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3200.08s)]
*  somebody who was charged during the Biden administration with five felonies he is a [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3206.72s)]
*  Democrat and so any sort of claim about politicization it's a little weird because [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3213.2799999999997s)]
*  it was a Biden administration that charged him. He was charged about nine months before the [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3219.36s)]
*  the primaries here in New York City. This is what's unusual the first sort of way this blew up is that [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3226.48s)]
*  the acting U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York that has the case sent a letter to [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3235.76s)]
*  Pam Bondi saying I have been ordered to dismiss the case and I've been told to dismiss the case [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3242.8s)]
*  not because there's a factual issue not because we've got the law wrong but because this is going [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3249.68s)]
*  to among other things interfere with Eric Adams ability to carry out the Trump administration [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3257.8399999999997s)]
*  immigration policies and that is a quid pro quo using from her point of view using the [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3266.16s)]
*  the criminal case to get somebody to do the political bidding of the president [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3272.8s)]
*  and to make sure that he's doing that she says they want us to not dismiss the case for good [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3280.0s)]
*  and that could be achieved also by the president pardoning Eric Adams but they don't want that [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3286.48s)]
*  they want to do is dismiss it without prejudice so that it's dangling over his head like a choke [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3291.28s)]
*  chain but so that he has to do their bidding and in fact he has done that he then appeared [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3298.16s)]
*  on Fox News saying that he would allow ICE agents to come into New York City to effectuate arrests [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3306.96s)]
*  in locations that's against the law right eggs that's exactly right so so one point I made with [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3315.7599999999998s)]
*  Jen Psaki is this the current mayor of the city of New York is under indictment federally currently [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3322.72s)]
*  with five felonies he is out on bail and he is on tv saying ICE agents should come in and violate [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3330.9599999999996s)]
*  local law so that's the state where a motion has been made by the acting deputy attorney general [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3339.6s)]
*  to the judge overseeing the case to do just what he had directed the southern district prosecutor [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3349.04s)]
*  to do the reason he had to do it is I think we're up to eight I might have my math wrong I never do [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3356.96s)]
*  math in public so it's either seven or eight prosecutors career people some with stellar [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3364.48s)]
*  sort of conservative credentials have resigned over this as they should because the idea that [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3371.44s)]
*  you would use the criminal law to do your political bidding is imagine Dan that the next step is [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3377.84s)]
*  I'm going to ask a congress a democratic congress person I'm going to say you know what I'm willing [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3387.44s)]
*  to suspend your criminal case but you're going to vote with the Republicans during that time and [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3394.0s)]
*  let's see how your voting record goes and if you toe the line I mean that is a quid pro quo also [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3399.36s)]
*  or imagine that Eric Adams said to a bill Bovi I'm going to give you a bag of cash [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3405.52s)]
*  to do this I mean all of those things are why you're seeing so many career people say [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3412.96s)]
*  this is not the role of the justice department and just think about that awesome power that would give [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3420.88s)]
*  the president and the department of justice to actually bend people to their will [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3428.08s)]
*  on the pain of being criminally prosecuted and going to jail the there was a hearing in this case [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3435.44s)]
*  uh this week as you pointed out that the deputy general had to make the argument himself because [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3441.92s)]
*  it appears like no one else would do it what recourse does the judge have here could the judge [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3447.12s)]
*  deny the motion to dismiss and if that were to happen who would prosecute the case so the law [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3452.24s)]
*  is extremely favorable to the government because prosecutorial discretion is something that is [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3458.0s)]
*  recognized as almost uniquely an executive branch function and as you point out Dan if the court [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3464.48s)]
*  were to say you have to go forward the southern district of New York or now the public integrity [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3471.6800000000003s)]
*  section because the case was moved from the southern district to the public integrity section [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3476.88s)]
*  by the deputy attorney general where by the way he moved it and the what happened was prosecutors [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3480.96s)]
*  resigned in the southern district he moved to the public integrity section the public integrity [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3487.44s)]
*  section that's people reside because people are like i didn't sign up for this um so what can the [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3490.96s)]
*  judge do um he has a narrow ability to say i'm denying the motion uh and if necessary he could [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3496.64s)]
*  appoint somebody uh to go forward he could uh decide that he's going to have the case dismissed [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3505.76s)]
*  but with prejudice not with not uh not without prejudice so that there isn't this sort of [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3513.04s)]
*  damocles or choke chain uh component to it um he could hold a factual hearing that's what i would [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3518.96s)]
*  do um because you need to know what is the is there a quid pro quo and what's the nature of it [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3527.2s)]
*  and make people have to testify at your oath one of the little tidbits that i want to make [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3534.96s)]
*  sure people understand is danielle sessi and the southern district um acting u.s attorney who resigned [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3539.28s)]
*  noted in her letter that when they had a meeting with the acting deputy attorney general but the [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3546.96s)]
*  trump former trump criminal defense lawyer a new york minute ago um that he ordered her people to [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3552.48s)]
*  stop taking notes and then confiscated them and the acting deputy attorney general has not denied [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3560.32s)]
*  that he has admitted that he did it but he says he did it to prevent leaks that is not facially [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3568.88s)]
*  plausible to me that that's the reason because you know how you you can't prevent leaks by taking [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3577.44s)]
*  notes right people can leak without having notes of their conversation all it does do is that [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3583.04s)]
*  eliminate the written record so that you can lie about what happened could if there is such a [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3589.84s)]
*  factual hearing took place could they could the judge demand those notes presumably they haven't [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3596.56s)]
*  found the bottom of a paper shredder somewhere in main justice so the answer is yes he can demand [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3602.32s)]
*  the notes and if they have been destroyed uh that is one it can be used by the judge to as evidence [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3607.12s)]
*  that they would have been favorable to danielle sessian's position that there was a quid pro quo [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3617.7599999999998s)]
*  i mean to me it's i mean this is you don't have to be a lawyer to understand that if you [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3622.8s)]
*  if you confiscate the notes and shred them you're entitled to draw inferences from the fact that you [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3628.0s)]
*  did that um if they were helpful for you you don't destroy them right right you put you put them in [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3632.96s)]
*  a safe somewhere right exactly um so uh the other thing he could do is um something that emet sullivan [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3638.0800000000004s)]
*  did in the michael flinn case uh so that is in trump 1.0 where remarkably this is like the only [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3645.92s)]
*  other time i've ever heard anything like this happening and i was a prosecutor for 21 years [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3654.48s)]
*  the only other time i can think of a situation like this is from trump 1.0 of course um and um [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3659.44s)]
*  there what the judge did is he appointed somebody to represent the public interest he said you know [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3667.6s)]
*  i've got the government in the defense um aligned here but that they may not be presenting everything [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3673.84s)]
*  because i have danielle sessian's letter saying that's not what happened here so emet sullivan [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3680.56s)]
*  was in that situation and he appointed a former judge john gleason to represent and advocate with [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3686.2400000000002s)]
*  respect to the law and what else the judge should consider it doesn't mean the judge had to agree [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3694.0s)]
*  what that that's uh amicus said but it was important to have another voice at the table [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3699.9199999999996s)]
*  when the whole idea is that um there's a collusion between the government and um the defense at issue [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3706.3199999999997s)]
*  last question on this i'm sort of obsessed with it so i've gone a long time on it but [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3714.3999999999996s)]
*  could uh a local prosecutor maybe alvin brag take up this case absolutely so this is like music to [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3718.24s)]
*  my ears because i wrote a short piece for just security can i just give a big plug because [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3725.36s)]
*  i'm pleased even though i'm on the board there the people who do the day-to-day work are so great [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3730.08s)]
*  trust security is affiliated with my law school where i teach um it's just a great place for [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3735.6800000000003s)]
*  independent smart analysis it's also got a litigation tracker so if you're trying to keep [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3742.6400000000003s)]
*  track of the you know i think we're up to 80 cases that have been filed since january 20th with [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3747.36s)]
*  respect to um the actions of this administration um you can sort of see it there but i did a short [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3753.12s)]
*  piece set pointing out that alvin brag the manhattan district attorney um has definitely has the legal [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3758.64s)]
*  authority to do this and he has the state crimes that are entirely comparable to the federal crimes [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3765.92s)]
*  and i sort of matched them up and i think your listeners know that alvin brag has done this [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3773.12s)]
*  before where he has stepped into the breach obviously most famously with respect to the [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3780.16s)]
*  donald trump case when the feds balked but he did it in the steve bannon case as well could he get [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3785.04s)]
*  access to i can't remember what happened in that case whether the u.s attorney's office shared the [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3791.44s)]
*  evidence that they had gained with alvin brag but here i imagine the uh pam bondi uh torn dresses [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3796.56s)]
*  would not do that for brag this time around i agree with you that if it has not happened already [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3803.44s)]
*  their position would be they would not want to do it but uh there's reason to think that it may [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3809.36s)]
*  have happened already we would just know it because it would be under seal but the prior when daniel [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3816.6400000000003s)]
*  sesson was still uh you know the the acting u.s attorney um she could have shared that it is [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3822.4s)]
*  legal to do that under just to be nerdy federal rule of criminal procedure six that governs [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3830.7200000000003s)]
*  federal grand jury secrecy there's a provision that permits the federal government to share [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3836.08s)]
*  that information with the state prosecutor and so that may have happened and it's worth remembering [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3841.36s)]
*  that although it's not on the same charges alvin brag has a case involving public corruption of a [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3847.12s)]
*  principal advisor to mayor adams so it's already in the mix now it's not the same scheme i just [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3857.28s)]
*  want to make sure as people know it's not it's not apples to apples but all of that suggests to me [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3864.8s)]
*  if i were in the you know in the southern district of new york i would have been thinking about [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3871.44s)]
*  making sure that the evidence that i've amassed lives somewhere independent of people who want to [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3877.84s)]
*  engage in bad behavior on a separate topic the interim u.s attorney of washington dc has [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3889.12s)]
*  been making uh has been suggesting that he's going to investigate and probe people who make threats [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3895.68s)]
*  he sent a letter to center center schumer about a comment center schumer made uh four years ago [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3900.56s)]
*  about uh concern about supreme court justices he's there's been some contact with congressman [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3905.92s)]
*  robert garcia's office just what is your reaction to this like i know weaponization is a there's a [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3911.84s)]
*  real term that doesn't mean anything anymore after trump's in charge but this sort of weaponization [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3919.52s)]
*  of a u.s attorney's office so can i just say with the word weaponization like this is [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3923.76s)]
*  that is a real thing i don't want donald trump to be able to co-opt it to say no you're doing it [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3931.44s)]
*  no i'm doing facts matter and what we're seeing is the actual weaponization of the department of [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3938.08s)]
*  justice um and so um you know i'm big on if you want to use a label where are the facts to support [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3943.44s)]
*  it um and that that isn't something that they have um what in my view what ed barton is doing [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3951.6s)]
*  i mean he's never as i as far as i know has never been a prosecutor he's he's engaging in behavior [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3959.2s)]
*  that is completely thuggish um and you know this is one of those things where at some point [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3965.12s)]
*  the worm will turn and he will not be in that position if he engages in behavior that is [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3972.4s)]
*  criminal there are sanctions for that um if he engages in behavior that violates professional [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3978.7999999999997s)]
*  norms i know this seems small bore but he can be sanctioned and actually disbarred so one of the [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3986.08s)]
*  things that i think there's already a bar complaint against him is he is the acting u.s attorney [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=3992.16s)]
*  he previously was um doing defense work and was actually the council of record on january six [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4001.44s)]
*  cases for those defendants there's nothing wrong with that i mean if you're being a defense lawyer [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4009.04s)]
*  on controversial cases can be a very noble thing he did both at the same time he was he actually [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4014.0s)]
*  sought to dismiss cases where he was the prosecutor and the defense that is not allowed in the legal [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4021.6s)]
*  profession you know you've mentioned daniel sassoon and these members of the public integrity [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4027.44s)]
*  section who have resigned and resigning is you know is a principal thing but also maybe the other [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4032.0s)]
*  way of thinking about it is the principal people keep leaving the department at a time when it [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4037.2s)]
*  really needs principal people like you know you're a longtime veteran of uh the department of justice [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4040.96s)]
*  what do you think they should be doing what's the right thing to do here what's the best way [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4046.88s)]
*  is there a way to protect the rule of law from within the department in the situation there [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4050.72s)]
*  right that's that is a tough and great question here's here's um so when i think it's a very [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4055.52s)]
*  individualized decision about sort of what you do but at some point there is no choice because [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4062.0s)]
*  you are being directed to do something that you have determined um is either illegal [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4071.04s)]
*  unethical or just violates you know whatever principles you have and you can't stomach um [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4078.0800000000004s)]
*  for instance i don't believe in the death penalty if somebody directed me and said you have to [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4083.6000000000004s)]
*  prosecute a death penalty case um i would either say you have to fire me or i'm going to resign [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4088.6400000000003s)]
*  i'm not i don't really i think that's sort of dancing on ahead of a pin about which way you [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4094.8s)]
*  do it um the arguments either way so at some point if you're in that position where you're [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4098.8s)]
*  directed to do something that you actually have no choice i mean you can't it i mean you can't go [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4104.08s)]
*  forward you're and look at yourself in the mirror um i think it's um i think the harder situation [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4110.0s)]
*  is purportedly when um amiel bovey was trying to find somebody to do the evil deed of like filing [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4116.4s)]
*  this motion um and the he takes the southern district of new york prosecutors off and then [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4124.48s)]
*  he goes to public integrity of all places the public integrity section of his public corruption [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4129.68s)]
*  cases and he basically is of zoom is like putting him in a meeting and it's basically cough up [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4134.88s)]
*  somebody or i mean what i understand is it's cough up somebody or you're gone that's sort of the [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4140.64s)]
*  message um and that's where there's a i think a healthy debate about what's the best way to [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4146.72s)]
*  deal with that do you cough somebody up uh do you all resign i mean i think there are pros and cons [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4153.6s)]
*  what ultimately happened was one person who was near retirement said i'll sign it uh and essentially [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4160.56s)]
*  he then saves what i'll call the good people because they don't then all get fired and so [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4167.68s)]
*  that is a positive and if you look at the actual filing that he signed it's really interesting [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4173.92s)]
*  because the the attorney who signed it did not make any factual representations that were false [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4180.24s)]
*  everything was the acting deputy attorney general has determined the following the acting deputy [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4189.2s)]
*  attorney general believes this the acting deputy attorney general has directed x so the person put [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4195.84s)]
*  their name on it but was not going to represent anything as being true or or his own beliefs and [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4202.24s)]
*  one other point when this actually went to court you've noted that only amy el bove came and i [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4209.12s)]
*  think there's a reason for that because if the other lawyer had shown up um and this is essentially [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4216.0s)]
*  what happened in the roger stone case um when the same similar situation happened and career [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4222.48s)]
*  prosecutors withdrew from the case if you have that person show up that would have given judge [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4228.24s)]
*  hoe the ability to say tell me what happened like what happened why are you here why did you sign [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4234.16s)]
*  it um what's going on and all of the facts about what happened and what amy el bove had said to [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4239.92s)]
*  the group of public integrity people would have spilled out on the record so in some ways amy el [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4246.0s)]
*  bove was smart to be the person to stand up but dan that's another thing that's just so unusual [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4251.12s)]
*  not only is it completely unheard of to see career people resign last time i can think of it was [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4257.5199999999995s)]
*  trump 1.0 and prior to that of note it's it's the saturday massacre um but the deputy attorney [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4264.08s)]
*  general does not go to court right that's right they're busy theoretically he's been very busy [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4271.68s)]
*  clearly um last question for you these are obviously very dangerous scary times um for lots of people [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4279.04s)]
*  the you know as you point out trump is and ed martin and amy el bove are weaponizing the [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4286.16s)]
*  department of justice things are going to get a lot scarier cash patel was confirmed on thursday [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4291.12s)]
*  to be fbi director uh there have been explicit threats made to you steve bannon uh suggests [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4295.28s)]
*  that you should go to prison for a long time how are how are you processing that what is your [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4300.88s)]
*  reaction to it how are you thinking about the the personal risk for yourself well um i'm in very [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4305.5199999999995s)]
*  good company uh there are lots and lots of people um on that list uh i still after all this time i'm [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4312.24s)]
*  still an institutionalist who believes that facts and law matter since i i haven't done anything [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4322.32s)]
*  wrong uh doesn't mean they can't make my life and a lot of other people's lives um you know hell and [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4329.04s)]
*  misery but um there are judges in this country and there are juries in this country and there are [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4335.92s)]
*  grand juries and there are trial juries and that so far is not in those institutions have not been [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4342.56s)]
*  undermined uh it's a very sad state that we're sort of where we are um but i i tend to not try [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4351.52s)]
*  to not sort of personalize it and just think about some big picture where we are and [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4359.2s)]
*  going back to what you were we were talking about when you asked what should career people do [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4365.84s)]
*  i don't really have any other choice because i'm not going to stop speaking what's on my mind and [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4374.0s)]
*  saying what i think and like the day i stopped doing that it's like i can't look at myself in [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzOAIw3bqV0&t=4379.92s)]
