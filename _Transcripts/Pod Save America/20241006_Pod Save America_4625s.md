Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

*  Welcome to Pod Save America. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=36.22s)]
*  I'm Jon Favreau. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=37.42s)]

*  I'm Dan Pfeiffer. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=49.26s)]
*  We got a great show for you tonight. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=52.379999999999995s)]
*  Your next senator from the state of Michigan, Alyssa Slockin, is here. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=54.86s)]
*  And we're so lucky to have tonight University of Michigan legal scholar and strict scrutiny [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=57.86s)]
*  co-host, Ann Arbor's very own, Leah Littman. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=68.34s)]
*  All right, guys. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=72.86s)]
*  We are 30 days out from the election. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=78.94s)]
*  How's everyone feeling? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=83.1s)]
*  You're going to win? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=84.1s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=87.1s)]
*  So, the vibes in this race have gone from bad in the spring to great in the summer to [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=89.1s)]
*  extremely anxious right now. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=95.1s)]
*  NBC News reports that the Harris campaign is planning on using these final weeks to, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=98.1s)]
*  quote, more aggressively attack Donald Trump. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=104.1s)]
*  You guys like that? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=107.1s)]
*  It's not for you. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=110.1s)]
*  Well, they see it as the best way to win over the small but decisive group of undecided [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=114.1s)]
*  voters because as one Harris campaign official said to NBC of this extremely close race, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=121.1s)]
*  quote, the numbers aren't moving. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=128.1s)]
*  Harris certainly made the contrast with Trump clear here in Michigan on Friday. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=131.1s)]
*  She did a rally in Flint and Detroit. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=136.1s)]
*  In Flint, she was with Michigan state legend Magic Johnson. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=140.1s)]
*  And she attacked Trump's record on labor and manufacturing. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=144.1s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=148.1s)]
*  Donald Trump's track record is a disaster for working people. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=149.1s)]
*  And he's trying to gaslight people all over our country. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=154.1s)]
*  But we know the facts and we know the truth. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=158.1s)]
*  He is an existential threat to America's labor movement. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=162.1s)]
*  America lost nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs when he was president, including tens [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=166.1s)]
*  of thousands of jobs in Michigan. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=175.1s)]
*  And those losses started before the pandemic, making Donald Trump one of the biggest losers [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=179.1s)]
*  of manufacturing jobs in American history. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=192.1s)]
*  She really leaned into that losers thing, huh? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=200.1s)]
*  Really leaned in. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=203.1s)]
*  So, Dan, the Harris campaign told NBC that internal research is showing that the most [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=204.1s)]
*  effective message for voters, for undecided voters, the ones they're still trying to persuade, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=211.1s)]
*  is that Trump is unstable, which is a bit of a shift in thinking from the conventional wisdom [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=215.1s)]
*  we've talked about up until now, that people have already made up their minds about Trump, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=221.1s)]
*  and the best message is about Kamala Harris, her values, and what she'd do as president. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=226.1s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=232.1s)]
*  This is a shift, but I don't think it's as dramatic a shift as people think it is. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=234.1s)]
*  Because up to this point, Kamala Harris has run most of her ads been positive, but about half of them [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=238.1s)]
*  have had some form of negative in them, usually either a fully negative ad on Trump or contrast [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=244.1s)]
*  ad that has some positive about her and some negative about Trump. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=248.1s)]
*  But the order in which she did this makes sense, which is when Kamala Harris got in this race, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=251.1s)]
*  she was an unknown figure to most of the country, and she was also a deeply unpopular figure. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=255.1s)]
*  Her approval ratings were no better than Biden's, and so over the course of the last few months here, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=260.1s)]
*  she was out campaigning, there was a convention, there was a debate, and they ran tens of millions [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=264.1s)]
*  of dollars of ads to teach people about her, who she is, her values, her visions, and her policies, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=269.1s)]
*  and that worked spectacularly. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=274.1s)]
*  Her approval rating went up 16 points, she now has a net favorability, and she's much more popular than Trump. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=276.1s)]
*  And you have to establish that bit of credibility with the electorate before you can start making [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=281.1s)]
*  negative ads, because they're not going to believe you. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=286.1s)]
*  And also, the other side of negative ads will be more effective because they are filling in a vacuum. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=288.1s)]
*  And so we are now on the closing argument phase of the campaign. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=293.1s)]
*  We are 30 days away from the election. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=296.1s)]
*  And so now is the time to make the argument against Trump. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=298.1s)]
*  It doesn't mean she's going to stop talking about herself. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=301.1s)]
*  Like, she's going to do that, these events will still be positive ads, because the New York Times [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=303.1s)]
*  Post-Debate poll said that a quarter of voters still want to learn more about her. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=307.1s)]
*  But there are voters, and I know this is hard to believe, but there are voters who feel like they need to learn [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=311.1s)]
*  more about Trump. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=315.1s)]
*  And it's about one in ten, it's true, it's about one in ten voters. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=316.1s)]
*  And those voters are not, and there's so much bad shit about Trump. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=320.1s)]
*  Like, we were just talking on the last podcast about the unsealed filing that Jack Smith made, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=325.1s)]
*  which basically has Trump cheering on the hanging of Mike Pence. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=330.1s)]
*  And these ten voters... [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=333.1s)]
*  Attempted hanging. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=335.1s)]
*  What's that? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=336.1s)]
*  Attempted hanging. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=337.1s)]
*  Attempted hanging, yes. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=338.1s)]
*  No thanks to Donald Trump. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=339.1s)]
*  We like to be fact first here. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=340.1s)]
*  Before we get to the section on conspiracy theories later. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=342.1s)]
*  And these voters are not going to hear this negative information about Trump by reading it in the news [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=345.1s)]
*  or listening to it on a podcast. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=351.1s)]
*  The only way to show it to them is to pay for it. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=353.1s)]
*  To put it in their feed when they're scoring social media, to put it on YouTube when they're looking at videos, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=355.1s)]
*  to put it on TV when they're watching college football games. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=359.1s)]
*  And so this is the right thing to do. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=362.1s)]
*  And I do think that the unstable message is interesting because it's happening in a time of sort of increased [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=363.1s)]
*  chaos around the world, insecurity about what's happening, a hurricane here, violent attacks in the Middle East. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=369.1s)]
*  And it's worth reminding people that Donald Trump is not just some normal Republican with differing views on health care and taxes. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=376.1s)]
*  He is a dangerous individual, right? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=383.1s)]
*  He is a deranged, declining, pretty dumb guy at a very dangerous time. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=385.1s)]
*  And we can't run away from that. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=392.1s)]
*  And I do think that like to Dan's point of this is not that much of a shift. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=394.1s)]
*  A lot of this is not trying to teach people that Donald Trump is unstable. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=402.1s)]
*  It is reminding people that Donald Trump is unstable, reaffirming what they already believe about Donald Trump [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=406.1s)]
*  and making an argument about why it's important, right? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=411.1s)]
*  It's not changing people's minds about Trump. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=413.1s)]
*  It's affirming their instincts about him in a way that is persuasive, which is really just, I think, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=415.1s)]
*  a continuation of what they've already been doing. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=421.1s)]
*  Leah, you live here, so you've been inundated with ads and talking to plenty of people about the race. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=424.1s)]
*  What are you hearing and what do you think of the strategy? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=431.1s)]
*  So first, I just have to say something about the weirdest ad I have seen repeatedly. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=434.1s)]
*  There is an ad that runs on cable that tells me to vote for Donald Trump, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=439.1s)]
*  and it's a woman who's a health care provider, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=444.1s)]
*  and she tells me that under Joe Biden, she had to provide health care to someone she didn't want to. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=446.1s)]
*  And I pause and I think you are running an ad that reminds people you want to deny people health care, right? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=452.1s)]
*  Like when you want to weaken the Affordable Care Act, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=461.1s)]
*  you want to send women to emergency rooms where they can't obtain health care. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=464.1s)]
*  This is nuts, and yet this is the ad I see repeatedly. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=468.1s)]
*  You know, on the strategy of going negative on some level, I like it. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=472.1s)]
*  You know, I like to be reminded that there is room in the Democratic Party for shit posters and mean girls. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=477.1s)]
*  Like, I feel very seen. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=483.1s)]
*  On the other hand, I think focusing on Trump and Trump being uniquely bad [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=485.1s)]
*  misses an opportunity to remind people what the Democratic Party has done in Michigan and could do still, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=493.1s)]
*  because we have had, yes, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=501.1s)]
*  our Democratic legislature has done clean energy reform. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=509.1s)]
*  They have expanded voting rights. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=516.1s)]
*  They have protected the queer community in Michigan. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=520.1s)]
*  And they've done all of this with a small majority, so we need to keep the state house blue. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=525.1s)]
*  And we also need to focus on the down ballot races, which again aren't about Trump. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=530.1s)]
*  There's a nonpartisan section on the Michigan ballot for the Michigan Supreme Court. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=539.1s)]
*  And the reason why we have a reproductive freedom for all amendment in Michigan [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=546.1s)]
*  is because the Michigan Supreme Court ordered the board of canvassers to allow the people to vote on the amendment. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=553.1s)]
*  The Michigan Supreme Court is a critical, critical race, and Justice Kyra Bolden [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=560.1s)]
*  and Kimberley and Thomas are the justices we need on the Michigan Supreme Court. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=566.1s)]
*  So Kyra and Kim for the win. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=576.1s)]
*  It's not just about Trump being a shitty, dumb, deranged individual. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=579.1s)]
*  And we got to spend some time with them today. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=583.1s)]
*  They are so, so impressive. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=585.1s)]
*  You're not just getting to vote for them, you're getting to vote for really amazingly qualified people. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=587.1s)]
*  Easy to remember. Kyra and Kim for the win. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=592.1s)]
*  I didn't meet them because I was in Ohio. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=594.1s)]
*  I can't believe you. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=600.1s)]
*  I had a great time. I had a great time in Ohio. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=601.1s)]
*  He was at a Buckeyes game. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=604.1s)]
*  Speaking of going negative, I do think there's a way to combine both, which is, we've talked about this, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=606.1s)]
*  but the most effective testing ads are not just negative ads about Trump, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=613.1s)]
*  they're not just positive ads about Kamala Harris, they are contrast ads [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=619.1s)]
*  where you, again, you need to frame the election as a choice. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=623.1s)]
*  Here's the future under Trump, here's the future under Kamala Harris, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=627.1s)]
*  and it's not even just reminding people about Trump. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=630.1s)]
*  It's like every single day he gives us new material so that Kamala Harris can stand up there and say, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=633.1s)]
*  this is what you'll get for another four years if you elect him, and this is what you'll get if you elect me. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=639.1s)]
*  So I think that you could probably do both. Love it. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=643.1s)]
*  Kamala was focused on an economic contrast with Trump here in Michigan. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=645.1s)]
*  She also talked about the great economic news we got this week, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=649.1s)]
*  250,000 jobs created last month, unemployment down, wages up 4% from a year ago. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=653.1s)]
*  Polls have consistently shown that most voters still don't feel great about the economy, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=659.1s)]
*  and they tend to trust Trump more on the issue, though that gap has narrowed considerably [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=666.1s)]
*  since Kamala Harris has become the nominee, especially in the last month. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=672.1s)]
*  Do you think that shifting in terms of what she should be able to say, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=676.1s)]
*  can Kamala make economic progress part of her closing argument about the choice between her and Trump? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=680.1s)]
*  Yeah, I think she is doing that. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=687.1s)]
*  And the point that Dan made, I mean, a shift in approval of a politician of this magnitude and this short of time, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=689.1s)]
*  it's extraordinary, never before seen, nothing like that has happened before. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=697.1s)]
*  And actually, in more subtle ways, I think the same thing is happening in this economic argument. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=700.1s)]
*  There was a poll that came out today or yesterday that showed that among women for the first time, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=706.1s)]
*  they believe Kamala Harris's policies on the economy are better than Donald Trump's policies on the economy. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=711.1s)]
*  There's an AP poll from last week where she's basically kind of fought to even on whose policies would be better for you. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=718.1s)]
*  The other part of this is that most people do not have a clean line in their mind between where an economic policy ends [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=725.1s)]
*  and a health care policy begins. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=733.1s)]
*  She's been out there hammering the contrast on health care. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=735.1s)]
*  And if you're going to make prescription drugs more affordable, that is an economic issue. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=738.1s)]
*  So I think it's incredible how much progress they've made and how different this campaign sounds on the economy [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=742.1s)]
*  than the Biden campaign sounded on the economy. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=750.1s)]
*  Is it possible for her to win on this issue? Maybe, but maybe also she doesn't have to, right? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=753.1s)]
*  Like, we need to win on health care and abortion. We need to win on these issues of extremism and stability. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=758.1s)]
*  We have a deficit on immigration. We have a deficit on the economy. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=765.1s)]
*  But it seems like she's doing the things that you would do to try to fight to a draw. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=772.1s)]
*  I think the interesting change here is when it was Biden versus Trump, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=776.1s)]
*  it was a choice between the past and the present, the Trump economy and the Biden economy. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=780.1s)]
*  What Kamala Harris has done is she has tried to make it a choice about the future. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=785.1s)]
*  Because we could argue all day about what the macroeconomic numbers say about the economy and how people feel. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=790.1s)]
*  And you're not going to convince people that what they feel is not real, because prices are still high. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=799.1s)]
*  Inflation is down, but the prices have remained high. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=803.1s)]
*  And so the key here is about who's going to fight for you in the future between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=806.1s)]
*  And she has framed that, which is why she's narrowed the gap in a way. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=811.1s)]
*  Tommy, a lot of nervous Democrats, which is all Democrats, have been urging the Harris-Walls campaign [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=814.1s)]
*  to get the candidate out there, doing more interviews, more events, more of everything. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=822.1s)]
*  Kamala's sitting down with 60 Minutes on Monday night. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=827.1s)]
*  She's got a Univision town hall on Thursday. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=831.1s)]
*  And she apparently just recorded an episode of Alex Cooper's massive podcast, Call Her Daddy. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=834.1s)]
*  Daddy gang in the house, sorry. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=840.1s)]
*  Does all that count as being out there more? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=844.1s)]
*  Are there other places she should go, other people she should sit down with? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=847.1s)]
*  It does. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=850.1s)]
*  Pod Save America, of course. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=851.1s)]
*  Of course. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=852.1s)]
*  Thank you for that pity booking applause. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=853.1s)]
*  We do want to know why 60 Minutes is on on Monday. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=859.1s)]
*  The thing about 60 Minutes is it's usually on on Sunday, which comes after a football game, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=862.1s)]
*  which gets them a big audience, but we won't complain too much. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=867.1s)]
*  Yes, I mean, so I've talked to the Harris campaign and Tim Walz's people a lot about this. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=870.1s)]
*  What happened was Joe Biden drops out on July 21st. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=875.1s)]
*  They have to, she has to get the nomination. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=879.1s)]
*  She has to pick a VP. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=882.1s)]
*  They have to vet them. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=883.1s)]
*  They have to do a plan, a convention, a convention speech and then prepare for the debate. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=884.1s)]
*  And then Walz goes down a similar path and his debate happened on October 1st. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=888.1s)]
*  And so basically their bet was the debates were going to be the single biggest important single biggest moments [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=893.1s)]
*  of the campaign with the most eyeballs on the candidates. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=900.1s)]
*  So they had to do well. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=902.1s)]
*  Now that they are past those big moments, they're going to do more interviews. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=904.1s)]
*  And I think that Call Her Daddy is a really good idea. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=908.1s)]
*  I mean, she should do more traditional interviews like the 60 minutes, like the Univision town hall. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=913.1s)]
*  They should be gaggling with their traveling press corps every couple of days. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=918.1s)]
*  They should talk to all the local press they can possibly talk to. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=923.1s)]
*  I mean, Kamala Harris already started doing that. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=926.1s)]
*  She did local Philly TV was, I think, her first interview. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=928.1s)]
*  But then they have to think, OK, what's the audience we need? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=931.1s)]
*  We're the voters we need. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=935.1s)]
*  And how do we reach them? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=936.1s)]
*  And so I imagine for Call Her Daddy, they know that there's probably a lot of people watching or listening to that show [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=938.1s)]
*  who don't know that abortion is under threat in this country. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=945.1s)]
*  And they don't know that Donald Trump is going to make sure that they don't have access to it in every state, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=951.1s)]
*  let alone sort of the patchwork of laws that we have now. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=956.1s)]
*  And they need to reach them. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=959.1s)]
*  They also know that a lot of the persuadable voters that still exist are women under 50 [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=960.1s)]
*  without college degrees who are independents. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=967.1s)]
*  And they think, OK, how do we find those people and sort of reverse engineer a strategy from that? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=970.1s)]
*  Kamala Harris also did a show called All the Smoke. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=974.1s)]
*  It's an NBA focused podcast. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=977.1s)]
*  I imagine they did that because they know that she's been struggling with younger men, black and Latino men in particular. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=979.1s)]
*  And people who watch that show are there to consume NBA news or sports news. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=986.1s)]
*  They probably don't get a lot of political news in their lives. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=991.1s)]
*  And that's a way to reach them or reach an audience that they might not talk to ever except for through paid media. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=994.1s)]
*  So I think the critique of the campaign was a little bit unfair before the debates. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1001.1s)]
*  Now it's legitimate, but they are clearly hitting the gas. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1009.1s)]
*  And I think they need to do more. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1012.1s)]
*  But, you know, this is a good start. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1014.1s)]
*  I love the call her daddy thing. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1016.1s)]
*  Like it's not strict scrutiny, but it's really awesome because I think it drives home the contrast between Democrats and Republicans. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1018.1s)]
*  Democrats are the party that allows you to have fun and are normies. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1026.1s)]
*  Right. Like you can like Taylor Swift beer, football, freedom and all of these things and have fun and be a Democrat. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1030.1s)]
*  Whereas the Republicans are going on these like men's rights in cell podcasts. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1036.1s)]
*  Like we get a new clip from JD Vance every week from some weird podcast. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1040.1s)]
*  He went on saying weird shit. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1044.1s)]
*  And so Kamala Harris is doing a cool podcast and it's going to be fun and awesome. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1046.1s)]
*  And so I like the contrast. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1050.1s)]
*  Yeah, no, I agree. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1052.1s)]
*  All right. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1054.1s)]
*  We will be back in a bit with more news. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1056.1s)]
*  And we're back. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1064.1s)]
*  This week, Donald Trump started several new conspiracies. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1068.1s)]
*  Wouldn't you know it, Laura Ingraham was standing by to help spread the bad word. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1071.1s)]
*  So now it's time to break it down in a segment we call OK, stop. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1074.1s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1080.1s)]
*  Let's see how Fox News handled its duty to viewers during this serious natural disaster. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1082.1s)]
*  OK, stop. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1088.1s)]
*  It's not the clip we talked about. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1098.1s)]
*  That's not the clip. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1100.1s)]
*  That's not the clip we talked about. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1102.1s)]
*  What is that? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1104.1s)]
*  What do we see on the screen? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1106.1s)]
*  It seems like there's somebody who's about to gone too soon. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1108.1s)]
*  Gone too soon. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1112.1s)]
*  Run into some mud. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1114.1s)]
*  All right. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1116.1s)]
*  Well, let's roll the clip. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1118.1s)]
*  OK, stop. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1122.1s)]
*  Did that hurt? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1124.1s)]
*  That looked like it hurt when your hair was rubbing against the net. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1126.1s)]
*  You were all muddy. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1128.1s)]
*  It's more on the knees and the legs. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1130.1s)]
*  You're in the gravel. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1132.1s)]
*  It's mud, but under the mud is dirt. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1134.1s)]
*  You can't see what's down there. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1136.1s)]
*  And also lifting these giant cubes. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1138.1s)]
*  They did me a nice job in the edit because when I was whipping this rope off of the column, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1140.1s)]
*  I really got Rachel in the face. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1144.1s)]
*  She got hit in the face with the rope. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1146.1s)]
*  And then Jeff said something on screen where he compared me to a movie cowboy. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1148.1s)]
*  And I said, I think I said, shut up, Jeff. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1154.1s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1160.1s)]
*  OK, let's keep rolling this. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1164.1s)]
*  John whipping that rope. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1168.1s)]
*  Wow. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1170.1s)]
*  You're good, got it. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1172.1s)]
*  Sierra and Andy. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1174.1s)]
*  There's mud on my left. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1178.1s)]
*  OK, stop. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1180.1s)]
*  So is that the only outfit that got dirty the whole time? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1182.1s)]
*  No, there are other outfits that also got dirty. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1192.1s)]
*  As you know, I did miss three dinners. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1196.1s)]
*  I just want to point out that this is a very funny moment because Sam is like, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1200.1s)]
*  is there mud on my lip? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1204.1s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1206.1s)]
*  Mud on your whole body, man. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1208.1s)]
*  So you got a little annoyed with Sammy for asking that and then you almost hit Rachel with the rope. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1210.1s)]
*  I did hit Rachel with the rope. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1216.1s)]
*  So we're wondering why you got voted off. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1218.1s)]
*  I don't think anybody's wondering why I got voted off. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1220.1s)]
*  All right. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1222.1s)]
*  Mud, we're going to win this challenge and every challenge that follows. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1224.1s)]
*  My name is Andy. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1228.1s)]
*  I live in Boston right now. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1230.1s)]
*  We don't really know each other, but this is a tribe that can win challenges because we did. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1232.1s)]
*  Are you from Los Angeles? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1236.1s)]
*  OK, stop. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1238.1s)]
*  Annika has gotten a lot of shit for that because it's like I'm gay and I'm from Los Angeles. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1242.1s)]
*  We ho? No, not we ho. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1246.1s)]
*  But she didn't deserve it. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1248.1s)]
*  Yeah, no, I think she was just trying to make conversation. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1250.1s)]
*  But here you go. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1254.1s)]
*  I want to see this part. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1256.1s)]
*  This is great. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1258.1s)]
*  And then I started a podcast called Pod Save America. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1260.1s)]
*  Well, how many of you listen to it? [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1264.1s)]
*  I haven't listened to it. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1266.1s)]
*  OK, stop. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1268.1s)]
*  When I first saw this and heard this, I was in tears. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1278.1s)]
*  I almost pissed my pants. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1282.1s)]
*  Maybe, maybe. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1284.1s)]
*  I like the person just trying. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1288.1s)]
*  I should pretend that I've listened to his fucking podcast. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1290.1s)]
*  They'd all heard of it. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1293.1s)]
*  Maybe, maybe. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1295.1s)]
*  They'd heard of it. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1297.1s)]
*  Did you change the way you speak to go on Survivor? [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1299.1s)]
*  You have like a new tone of voice, a new voice. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1301.1s)]
*  Is this like faux humility? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1303.1s)]
*  Like, oh, then I kind of started a podcast. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1305.1s)]
*  It's like no big deal. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1309.1s)]
*  Homophobic, homophobic. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1311.1s)]
*  Never do that impression again. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1315.1s)]
*  Shame on you. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1319.1s)]
*  I hate the spotlight. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1321.1s)]
*  The other one's named after me. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1323.1s)]
*  I never said I hate the spotlight. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1325.1s)]
*  Never said I hate the spotlight. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1327.1s)]
*  How big could it be? [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1329.1s)]
*  That's a funny thing to say. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1331.1s)]
*  I thought, what do you want to do? [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1333.1s)]
*  It gets very, very popular. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1335.1s)]
*  We sell out theaters in Ann Arbor. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1337.1s)]
*  What's that going to do for me? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1343.1s)]
*  I was trying to keep it light. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1345.1s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1347.1s)]
*  I'm going to show the clip. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1349.1s)]
*  I feel like your podcast is huge, right? [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1351.1s)]
*  You're right. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1353.1s)]
*  See? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1355.1s)]
*  What are you supposed to say? Shut up. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1357.1s)]
*  What do you say there? [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1359.1s)]
*  Yes, it's huge. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1361.1s)]
*  It's always at the top of the charts. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1363.1s)]
*  It's us fighting it out with Michael Barbaro. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1365.1s)]
*  There's your best friend. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1367.1s)]
*  Your best friend, Andy. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1369.1s)]
*  I want you to know, when I got to the hotel last night, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1371.1s)]
*  I turned on the TV and Survivor was on. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1373.1s)]
*  Andy, still going strong. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1375.1s)]
*  I'm aware. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1377.1s)]
*  We wish him the best, wherever he is. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1379.1s)]
*  And our special guest for tonight. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1383.1s)]
*  I will say, the silver lining to all of this, Leah, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1391.1s)]
*  is that, imagine what we would have done with every episode of just material. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1395.1s)]
*  I don't know that I could have survived it. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1405.1s)]
*  I know. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1407.1s)]
*  I couldn't survive the Survivor, but I don't know that I could have survived watching it. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1409.1s)]
*  If I connect with two people, it would actually be very hard to get voted out. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1413.1s)]
*  I'm Vine. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1417.1s)]
*  I'm gay. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1419.1s)]
*  Vine! [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1421.1s)]
*  Do you know that one? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1423.1s)]
*  Uh, okay. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1425.1s)]
*  I'm not that old. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1427.1s)]
*  I love Vine. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1429.1s)]
*  I was still a young person. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1431.1s)]
*  Looking at my tribe, I'm realizing I'm not getting to know a group of people. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1433.1s)]
*  I'm getting to know a group of young people. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1437.1s)]
*  I am 41 years old. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1439.1s)]
*  Okay, so I'm old now. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1441.1s)]
*  No, I really like Vine. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1443.1s)]
*  There's so much back in my day stuff coming out of my mouth. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1445.1s)]
*  But being a speechwriter, I learned. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1447.1s)]
*  Okay, stop. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1449.1s)]
*  Your interactions with them in the scene, I'm really sorry. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1451.1s)]
*  They remind me of JD Vance in the donut shop. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1455.1s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1457.1s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1459.1s)]

*  Fuck you. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1463.1s)]
*  Fuck you. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1465.1s)]
*  Oh, are you sorry? You're not sorry. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1467.1s)]
*  I'm not sorry. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1469.1s)]
*  I'm not sorry. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1471.1s)]
*  Oh, please. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1473.1s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1475.1s)]
*  How dare you. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1477.1s)]
*  The rule said you weren't going to fact check me. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1479.1s)]
*  This is the moment when we were watching where Emily was just like, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1485.1s)]
*  Oh, they gave him the old edit. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1489.1s)]
*  Finish the fucking thing. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1495.1s)]
*  But you need to be able to put yourself in other people's shoes. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1497.1s)]
*  I'm addicted to TikTok. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1499.1s)]
*  First person voted out of Survival 47. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1501.1s)]
*  John, that's four, that's enough. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1503.1s)]
*  You need to bring me your torch. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1505.1s)]
*  John, the chopper's broken. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1509.1s)]

*  I'll say something nice. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1513.1s)]
*  If Mike Pence has the courage to do the right thing, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1515.1s)]
*  you could still win Survivor. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1517.1s)]

*  Thank you, guys. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1527.1s)]
*  Bye, John. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1529.1s)]
*  Just like, okay, I am the host here. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1531.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1533.1s)]
*  I like you, but I am the host. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1535.1s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1537.1s)]
*  Look at Andy. Good job, Andy. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1539.1s)]
*  What a dick. That guy sucks. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1541.1s)]
*  We wish Andy... [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1543.1s)]
*  We'll talk that way about one of Love It's closest friends. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1545.1s)]
*  Yeah, that's my best friend you're talking about. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1547.1s)]
*  And that's okay, stop. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1551.1s)]
*  So, while Kamala Harris was here in Michigan, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1559.1s)]
*  Trump spent his Friday in Georgia and North Carolina, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1561.1s)]
*  focused on his core message, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1565.1s)]
*  a new conspiracy theory that the federal government [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1567.1s)]
*  isn't helping people who've been devastated by Hurricane Helene, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1569.1s)]
*  because Joe Biden and Kamala Harris [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1573.1s)]
*  spent all the money on people who came here illegally. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1575.1s)]
*  Trump has been spreading this garbage everywhere. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1577.1s)]
*  Elon Musk has been promoting even crazier conspiracies on Twitter. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1581.1s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene tweeted this about Democrats, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1585.1s)]
*  quote, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1589.1s)]
*  Yes, they can control the weather. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1591.1s)]
*  It's ridiculous for anyone to lie and say it can't be done. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1593.1s)]
*  That is ridiculous. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1597.1s)]
*  Hey, John, first of all, shame on you. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1599.1s)]
*  I've heard mixed stuff about that. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1601.1s)]
*  I've heard other people say that she was talking about Democrats. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1603.1s)]
*  Yeah, I think... [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1605.1s)]
*  Who is the space lasers? [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1607.1s)]
*  You do the math. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1609.1s)]
*  Anyway, even though FEMA, journalists, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1611.1s)]
*  Democratic and Republican officials in the affected states, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1613.1s)]
*  including Republican officials who support Trump, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1617.1s)]
*  keep begging Trump, Elon, others to stop spreading these lies, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1621.1s)]
*  Trump is not going to be able to do that. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1625.1s)]
*  Trump refuses. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1627.1s)]
*  Here he is on Friday. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1629.1s)]
*  It's been a terrible response from the White House. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1631.1s)]
*  They're missing a billion dollars that was used for another purpose, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1635.1s)]
*  and nobody's seen anything like that. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1639.1s)]
*  Now, from that standpoint, it's been terrible. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1641.1s)]
*  Now, a lot of the money that was supposed to go to Georgia [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1643.1s)]
*  and supposed to go to North Carolina and all of the others is going [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1647.1s)]
*  and has gone already. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1650.1s)]
*  It's been gone for people that came into the country illegally. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1652.1s)]
*  Look, we have a president that spends most of his time on the beach sleeping. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1656.1s)]
*  I never saw a guy could sleep in front of a camera. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1660.1s)]
*  Does anybody think of it? [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1663.1s)]
*  I don't sleep that much. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1665.1s)]
*  I toss and turn. I think, I think, I think. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1667.1s)]
*  I'm always thinking. Do you ever do that? [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1669.1s)]
*  You're sweating and you're thinking and you're trying to figure out [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1671.1s)]
*  how to beat this one, that... [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1674.1s)]
*  Look, how to make our country great. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1676.1s)]
*  But I toss and I turn. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1678.1s)]
*  He's thinking, he's thinking, he's thinking. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1682.1s)]
*  I think he's, I think he's confusing thinking and acid reflux. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1684.1s)]
*  I think you're describing anxiety. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1690.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1692.1s)]
*  He's just, he's trying to, he's just, he's losing sleep trying to figure out [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1693.1s)]
*  how to make this country great. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1696.1s)]
*  Tossing and turning. It's a lot of, it's a hard, it's a lot of, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1698.1s)]
*  it's a big thing to toss. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1701.1s)]
*  I think it's the diet coke. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1703.1s)]
*  Yeah, he's having diet cokes too late in the day. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1704.1s)]
*  Tommy, what is the truth here? [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1706.1s)]
*  Did the White House send a hurricane to devastate Trump supporters [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1708.1s)]
*  and then spend all our disaster relief money registering non-citizens to vote? [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1712.1s)]
*  Is that what happened? [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1717.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1718.1s)]
*  It was obviously, it's such a brazen and unbelievable lie. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1719.1s)]
*  And of course, with all Trump lies, there is an element of projection. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1723.1s)]
*  Because in 2019, he did divert a bunch of DHS disaster relief money [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1727.1s)]
*  to the southern border to build detention facilities for migrants. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1731.1s)]
*  So maybe that's part of this. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1735.1s)]
*  But the administration, the Biden administration has already allocated [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1737.1s)]
*  $110 million for disaster relief. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1741.1s)]
*  That is just the very beginning. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1743.1s)]
*  But Biden has also told Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1745.1s)]
*  Tennessee, and Virginia that the federal government is going to cover [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1749.1s)]
*  100% of the cost of things like debris removal, first responders, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1753.1s)]
*  emergency food and shelter. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1757.1s)]
*  So there's way more money to come. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1759.1s)]
*  But, you know, as you noted, like Elon Musk, Trump, Mark Robinson, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1762.1s)]
*  like the worst people in Republican politics, thank you for hissing at those [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1767.1s)]
*  people, are spreading these conspiracy theories. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1771.1s)]
*  And the result is you have Republicans in North Carolina begging them to stop, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1774.1s)]
*  begging them, because this is not just a political problem. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1780.1s)]
*  You have people calling these offices, you know, people who are in need, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1784.1s)]
*  who are stranded, who are worried, calling their local officials saying, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1789.1s)]
*  I'm reading that FEMA is going to repossess my assets or take over my farm. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1794.1s)]
*  And they're flooding these lines and people can't get good information. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1799.1s)]
*  They can't get the help they need. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1803.1s)]
*  Local offices are being inundated. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1805.1s)]
*  So this is a real problem that's putting people at risk. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1807.1s)]
*  And so, you know, what seems to have happened is the Republican party has [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1810.1s)]
*  turned into just a bunch of Alex Joneses. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1815.1s)]
*  You know, it's the worst of the worst spreading the biggest bullshit. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1818.1s)]
*  And, you know, we went we spent years having Republicans tell us that social [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1822.1s)]
*  media was lefty and rigged. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1827.1s)]
*  And now you've got Elon Musk buying Twitter. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1830.1s)]
*  You've got Facebook no longer caring about content moderation. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1833.1s)]
*  God knows what's happening on TikTok. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1836.1s)]
*  And this is kind of the like the lay of the land going into an election where [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1839.1s)]
*  we're going to have some very close calls and delayed election results. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1843.1s)]
*  And it's pretty unnerving. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1847.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's been if anyone has seen this on Twitter or on TikTok, it is a [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1849.1s)]
*  nightmare. Some of the conspiracies are even like some of them are funny. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1853.1s)]
*  They're so crazy. Some of them are not. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1856.1s)]
*  There's one about how the government directed the hurricane to western North [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1857.1s)]
*  Carolina because there's lithium there. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1861.1s)]
*  And so they wanted to destroy the town so they could get the lithium and I guess [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1864.1s)]
*  then make batteries like a doll goes back to the electric cars. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1868.1s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, there's stories that they're confiscating people's homes. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1874.1s)]
*  The theme is going and taking people's homes like it's wild. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1879.1s)]
*  Dan, the White House has been working really hard to debunk these conspiracies and [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1882.1s)]
*  show the president, vice president, FEMA doing everything they can to help. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1887.1s)]
*  Kamala Harris today is in North Carolina meeting with first responders, FEMA, Roy [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1891.1s)]
*  Cooper. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1897.1s)]
*  But of course, we know how easily disinformation, misinformation spreads in [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1898.1s)]
*  this environment. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1903.1s)]
*  How much does all this worry you and is there anything else you think they could [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1904.1s)]
*  be doing? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1908.1s)]
*  Well, John, I know you're famously offline, so you may not know this, but our [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1909.1s)]
*  information ecosystem is pretty shitty. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1913.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1916.1s)]
*  I mean, we really are at a point where there are no rules, no regulations, no [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1917.1s)]
*  referees. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1920.1s)]
*  It's like Mad Max Fury Road out there. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1921.1s)]
*  And it's a huge problem and it's not going to get fixed anytime soon because [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1923.1s)]
*  this is one case where the traditional political press can deservedly get a lot [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1928.1s)]
*  of shit for how they cover things. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1932.1s)]
*  But they are out there pushing back on this left and right and it doesn't matter [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1934.1s)]
*  because their reach is so diminished from what it was before and their [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1939.1s)]
*  credibility is so diminished that the people most likely to believe this stuff [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1943.1s)]
*  are the least likely to believe the press. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1947.1s)]
*  In fact, they usually view a fact check from the press as evidence of the [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1949.1s)]
*  conspiracy because the media would be in on it. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1953.1s)]
*  And so we're going to live in this world for a long time politically. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1956.1s)]
*  And it is, as Tommy sort of referenced, it is very scary when you think about [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1959.1s)]
*  the election and the sort of conspiracy theories about voter fraud and whatever [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1962.1s)]
*  else Trump wants to put out there to try to set up the big lie 2.0 is going to [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1968.1s)]
*  spread around faster with fewer checks than it did in 2020 exponentially. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1972.1s)]
*  And so the question is, what do you do about it? [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1976.1s)]
*  And there are no easy answers here. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1979.1s)]
*  And so the two things I would say is, one, all of us have agency here. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1981.1s)]
*  You know, we're not, I'm not suggesting that people here in the audience are [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1985.1s)]
*  listening today try to convince their deeply red-pilled uncle about this stuff. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1988.1s)]
*  But there are a whole bunch of people in your lives who are checking into politics [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1993.1s)]
*  right now for the first time, and they're going to ask some questions. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1996.1s)]
*  And they're more likely to trust you than they are to trust CNN or the New York [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=1998.1s)]
*  Times or the Wall Street Journal or someone like that. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2002.1s)]
*  So we should think about ourselves as the fact checkers for our friends. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2004.1s)]
*  And I think that's really important because we have real power to influence [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2008.1s)]
*  the people we know. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2010.1s)]
*  The second thing is, it's very hard because if you're in the perspective of [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2013.1s)]
*  the White House or the Harris campaign or just Democrats, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2018.1s)]
*  you don't want to go around playing whack-a-mole on all these things because [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2021.1s)]
*  you'll never get your message out. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2024.1s)]
*  You're just, and just if your whole campaign can't be Trump said X, but the [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2025.1s)]
*  reality is Y. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2029.1s)]
*  And so you have to take it a little bit bigger. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2030.1s)]
*  And so instead of playing his game, you have to call out his game. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2032.1s)]
*  And you have to call out why he is lying about these things, why he is trying to [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2034.1s)]
*  divide us to help him to get power for himself, to help his rich friends, and [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2038.1s)]
*  make it part of your overall message that he is trying to pull the wool over [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2041.1s)]
*  the American people's eyes so that he can gain power, avoid illegal [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2045.1s)]
*  accountability, and give tax cuts to his rich friends. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2049.1s)]
*  To our earlier discussion about the slight shift in strategy where she's going [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2052.1s)]
*  to be doing more contrast and more sort of attacks on Trump, I would, if I was [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2056.1s)]
*  Kamala Harris, I'd go and kick the shit out of him on this. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2061.1s)]
*  Like I would go out and you can't do that in the first week, right? [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2064.1s)]
*  She's done everything she should be doing. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2067.1s)]
*  She went to visit Georgia. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2068.1s)]
*  She's in North Carolina. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2069.1s)]
*  But at some point, she could just go out there and talk about and call out the game [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2070.1s)]
*  and what he's trying to do and how there are Democrats, Republicans, local [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2074.1s)]
*  officials, people like in red states, blue areas of red states working together to [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2080.1s)]
*  help people to clean this up. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2086.1s)]
*  And then there's Donald Trump who wants to win an election, right? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2088.1s)]
*  Which is just like what he's done with everything, every other issue. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2091.1s)]
*  Everything is about him trying to win an election. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2094.1s)]
*  And I think that I would just, I would just tell people, because then it, it [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2096.1s)]
*  shows the contrast that like if she's president, right, this is how she's going [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2099.1s)]
*  to handle dealing with a natural disaster, dealing with disaster relief. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2104.1s)]
*  Donald Trump's president. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2108.1s)]
*  Well, first of all, we know how he's handled natural disasters and he's just [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2109.1s)]
*  going to, he's going to do it again. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2112.1s)]
*  The other piece of this is why I think it's really important that we have to be [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2114.1s)]
*  doing this right now is there are still Republican governors that are willing to [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2118.1s)]
*  be honest about this to say that the Biden administration is doing a great job. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2123.1s)]
*  There's still that last piece of tether to the old earth where these people are [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2126.1s)]
*  willing to tell the truth about it. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2131.1s)]
*  And that's a, those Republicans are probably doing more good than anything a [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2132.1s)]
*  Democrat could say right now. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2136.1s)]
*  Right. That really matters. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2137.1s)]
*  And there's a ton of like AI images going around and they look silly. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2139.1s)]
*  They look, they don't look believable. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2143.1s)]
*  They may be fooling a certain subset of people who want to be fooled, but like [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2144.1s)]
*  it's not high on the list of things we talk about for why it's important to [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2148.1s)]
*  defeat Donald Trump and defeat this form of Republicanism. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2151.1s)]
*  It is very clear that like the technology is going to enable people to make up [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2154.1s)]
*  whatever they want. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2158.1s)]
*  The AI is going to become more persuasive. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2159.1s)]
*  Our only hope is defeating this form of Republicanism because the fact that like [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2161.1s)]
*  so many of these elected Republican leaders went to this form of politics so [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2166.1s)]
*  quickly, there will be no stopping them. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2170.1s)]
*  Leah, Politico ran a story Friday that says the politics of federal, the politics [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2172.1s)]
*  of federal disaster relief is a topic that Trump has always been keenly attuned [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2178.1s)]
*  to. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2182.1s)]
*  Is it your sense that Donald Trump has always been keenly attuned to the politics [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2183.1s)]
*  of natural disasters? [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2187.1s)]
*  Well, so he has been attuned to it in the following sense, which I think gets at [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2188.1s)]
*  your point about Vice President Harris being able to drive home a contrast [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2193.1s)]
*  between herself and Donald Trump. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2197.1s)]
*  You know, it came out this past week, the reports that when California needed [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2199.1s)]
*  federal support in order to get that federal support from Donald Trump, his aides [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2204.1s)]
*  went to him and basically showed him you actually have a large number of voters [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2210.1s)]
*  in California before he would actually accede to the request for federal relief [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2215.1s)]
*  in California. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2221.1s)]
*  And this is the lie that he is trying to attribute to the Biden administration [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2222.1s)]
*  now. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2228.1s)]
*  And it's exactly what people warned about. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2229.1s)]
*  It came up at his impeachment trial regarding the effort to extort Zelensky to [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2232.1s)]
*  accuse Biden of misdeeds. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2237.1s)]
*  You know, law professor, Stanford law professor Pam Carlin testified and she [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2239.1s)]
*  invited lawmakers. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2244.1s)]
*  Imagine you live in a state that experiences severe weather events and your [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2245.1s)]
*  governor goes to the president and is requesting disaster relief and he says to [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2250.1s)]
*  your governor, what are you going to do for me? [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2255.1s)]
*  And this is the exact problem with Donald Trump. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2258.1s)]
*  And he is, again, telling everyone that the Biden administration is doing exactly [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2261.1s)]
*  what he did. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2266.1s)]
*  And it's just it's gross. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2267.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2269.1s)]
*  No, it is. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2270.1s)]
*  And I honestly like her talking about that. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2271.1s)]
*  It's the right thing to do. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2274.1s)]
*  But I also think like in this homestretch, this is it's politically wise to draw [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2275.1s)]
*  that contrast. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2280.1s)]
*  It look they are doing everything they are supposed to do to respond to a storm. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2281.1s)]
*  And Donald Trump, the only reason this kind of politics is successful is because [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2285.1s)]
*  people are already so cynical that they believe the government operates the way [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2289.1s)]
*  Donald Trump would operate it if he were in power. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2293.1s)]
*  It works because they believe Donald Trump will do what he would have what he [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2296.1s)]
*  already did when he was president and what he would do again. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2299.1s)]
*  And it's so fucking cynical. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2302.1s)]
*  I have nothing to say about it. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2303.1s)]
*  I'm just furious. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2305.1s)]
*  It's outrageous. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2306.1s)]
*  It's outrageous. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2307.1s)]
*  Evil. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2308.1s)]
*  Well, before we move on, we got to talk about Melania Trump, who hasn't been on [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2309.1s)]
*  the campaign trail for her husband or really anywhere this entire race until this [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2315.1s)]
*  week. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2320.1s)]
*  So a reporter at The Guardian got their hands on an early copy of her book that's [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2321.1s)]
*  coming out next week and reported that in it, the former first lady reveals that she [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2326.1s)]
*  is stridently pro-choice. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2332.1s)]
*  Once I guess. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2335.1s)]
*  Sure. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2337.1s)]
*  What are you plotting? [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2338.1s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2339.1s)]
*  Don't put your hands away. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2340.1s)]
*  What? [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2341.1s)]
*  You've lost. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2342.1s)]
*  You've lost the credibility to applaud. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2343.1s)]
*  So the report happens. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2346.1s)]
*  And once the report gets out, Melania did what anyone would do in this situation and [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2349.1s)]
*  posted the following video. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2355.1s)]
*  Individual freedom is a fundamental principle that I safeguard. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2357.1s)]
*  Without a doubt, there is no room for compromise when it comes to this essential right that [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2363.1s)]
*  all women possess from birth. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2369.1s)]
*  Individual freedom. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2372.1s)]
*  What does my body, my choice really mean? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2374.1s)]
*  It reminds me of like the first days of the pandemic when we all were doing zooms and [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2378.1s)]
*  you had like one lamp in your living room. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2383.1s)]
*  So just like the left side of your face was lit. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2386.1s)]
*  What the fuck was that lighting? [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2388.1s)]
*  It's Melania for abortion for Elizabeth Arden. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2390.1s)]
*  It's like Two-Face from Batman. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2397.1s)]
*  Leo, what did you think of that? [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2400.1s)]
*  It's a shitty 90s perfume commercial. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2402.1s)]
*  It looks and sounds like she's auditioning to be the next villain from Genovia for Princess [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2406.1s)]
*  Diaries 3, right? [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2411.1s)]
*  Like it also kind of looks like that. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2413.1s)]
*  But, you know, in some sense, it is totally consistent with everything Republicans have [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2415.1s)]
*  done on abortion and reproductive justice, which is to gaslight and insist they are not [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2420.1s)]
*  going to do the exact thing we know they are going to do. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2424.1s)]
*  You know, when Donald Trump was running, he ran on a platform to appoint justices who [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2428.1s)]
*  would overrule Roe versus Wade. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2432.1s)]
*  But then when he nominated justices, all of the Republican senators are like, what are [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2433.1s)]
*  you talking about? [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2437.1s)]
*  They're not going to overrule Roe versus Wade. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2438.1s)]
*  And they're doing the exact same thing here. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2440.1s)]
*  And there is just a special place in hell for white women who will shill for the patriarchy. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2442.1s)]
*  The music? [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2449.1s)]
*  Was the music necessary? [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2456.1s)]
*  What was the music? [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2459.1s)]
*  Let's not lose the forest or the trees here. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2460.1s)]
*  She is releasing a book three weeks before the election in which she takes the opposite [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2462.1s)]
*  position of her husband on one of the most important issues in the election. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2467.1s)]
*  That is fucking bananas. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2471.1s)]
*  Okay, so let's talk, let's, because we don't know the answer to this, but do we think it [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2473.1s)]
*  was, some people say this was a strategy from the Trump campaign with Melania that they [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2477.1s)]
*  wanted to soften his image on abortion by saying, well, you know, he kind of believes [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2483.1s)]
*  everyone can do their own thing and his wife believes something different. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2487.1s)]
*  Or was it just coincidence and Melania wants to sell books? [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2491.1s)]
*  This is like the crypto, the watches, the shoes. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2494.1s)]
*  It is a way, like the clock is ticking here because if he loses in 30 days, no one's buying [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2497.1s)]
*  that fucking book. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2502.1s)]
*  So she got to sell it now. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2503.1s)]
*  This idea that it's a strategy, okay. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2505.1s)]
*  I think that like, so remember when she had that jacket that said, I don't really care [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2510.1s)]
*  to you? [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2514.1s)]
*  Yeah, I heard she talks about that in the book. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2515.1s)]
*  I'm sure she does. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2516.1s)]
*  And there was this whole news cycle about how she's sending a message to her husband. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2517.1s)]
*  No, she was upset about her press coverage. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2521.1s)]
*  And then there's a part of the book where she, so there was a mean video that claimed [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2523.1s)]
*  that Barron had autism. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2529.1s)]
*  And Rosie O'Donnell shared it and said, oh, maybe this will help for autism awareness, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2531.1s)]
*  deleted it when she found out it wasn't true. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2535.1s)]
*  Melania writes that this was one of the cruelest things. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2537.1s)]
*  Rosie, it was on purpose. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2539.1s)]
*  It was every time you try to, people have tried to ascribe some deeper meaning to Melania [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2540.1s)]
*  Trump's intentions. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2545.1s)]
*  What you have found on the other side of it is that she's a lot like her husband, that [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2546.1s)]
*  it's about bad press. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2551.1s)]
*  It's about personal grievance. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2552.1s)]
*  It's about attention and it's about what she can get for herself. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2553.1s)]
*  Like she's married to Donald Trump. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2557.1s)]
*  And there was also a report, I think it was CNN, tried to get an interview about the [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2560.1s)]
*  book and the publisher wrote back, yes, you can have one if you give us, it was $100,000? [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2564.1s)]
*  $250,000. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2569.1s)]
*  A quarter mil. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2571.1s)]
*  Sorry, a quarter mil. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2572.1s)]
*  They were trying to extract money for an interview about a book. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2574.1s)]
*  Which is way more than most of us charge for our interviews. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2578.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2581.1s)]
*  Who do you think you are, Moe Dang? [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2582.1s)]
*  I did that joke in Love or Leave It. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2585.1s)]
*  That's a recycled joke. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2588.1s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, like whether I agree with you, it feels too complicated for it to be a strategy, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2590.1s)]
*  but obviously like Donald Trump knew what was going to be in this book. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2595.1s)]
*  The release was timed for to maximize sales in the heat of the campaign. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2598.1s)]
*  So they knew this cycle was coming. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2602.1s)]
*  This narrative, this news cycle, you know, these reports about what she says. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2605.1s)]
*  I mean, yes, because they wanted to make money. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2609.1s)]
*  Donald Trump, who is running on some sort of faux populist agenda, is selling a $100,000 [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2611.1s)]
*  gold watch right now. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2616.1s)]
*  It's a nice watch. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2617.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2618.1s)]
*  A watch. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2619.1s)]
*  And you can buy it with Cryptone. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2620.1s)]
*  $100,000. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2622.1s)]
*  $100,000 gold watch. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2623.1s)]
*  It's the guy that people trust on the economy. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2624.1s)]
*  A lot of people breaking down the cost of the watch. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2626.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2629.1s)]
*  Shocker. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2630.1s)]
*  It's not an expensive watch. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2631.1s)]
*  No. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2632.1s)]
*  No shit. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2633.1s)]
*  Well, good luck on the book, Melania. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2634.1s)]
*  All right. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2635.1s)]
*  When we come back, your next senator, Alyssa Slocka. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2636.1s)]
*  And we're back. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2641.1s)]
*  We are thrilled to welcome to the show tonight the next U.S. senator from the great state [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2648.1s)]
*  of Michigan, Congresswoman Alyssa Slocka. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2656.1s)]
*  Hi, Tommy. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2659.1s)]
*  Here's your pumpkin. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2662.1s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2665.1s)]
*  That's all the political nerds. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2667.1s)]
*  That's a good reception. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2676.1s)]
*  First of all, thank you for letting us hang out with you today. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2678.1s)]
*  It was so fun. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2680.1s)]
*  We did two events together. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2681.1s)]
*  You have a new bus that's very beautiful. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2682.1s)]
*  RV. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2684.1s)]
*  And a wrap, sorry, RV. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2685.1s)]
*  That's an RV, Tommy. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2686.1s)]
*  But it was very like, you're having some big events. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2687.1s)]
*  Saturday morning, 9 a.m., 150 people knocking doors for you. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2689.1s)]
*  I mean, Michigan's where it's at. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2693.1s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2695.1s)]
*  Duh. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2697.1s)]
*  We're where it's at. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2698.1s)]
*  Let's talk about that. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2699.1s)]
*  So Axios reported that last week you told some supporters that Kamala Harris is underwater [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2700.1s)]
*  in the state of Michigan. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2706.1s)]
*  This same report also said that Republicans believe that your race is tightening. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2707.1s)]
*  What's the truth here? [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2713.1s)]
*  I mean, how are you feeling about Kamala Harris's odds in Michigan and your race against Mike [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2715.1s)]
*  Rogers? [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2719.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2720.1s)]
*  I mean, I think anyone who's from Michigan will tell you that the minute you sleep on [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2721.1s)]
*  Michigan, it's going to go the wrong direction, right? [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2725.1s)]
*  In 2016, we voted for Trump in this state, right? [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2728.1s)]
*  And closest margin in the country. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2732.1s)]
*  And then we've been making up for it ever since, right? [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2734.1s)]
*  By electing Gretchen Whitmer and our attorney general, our secretary of state. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2737.1s)]
*  And so I think to me, I mean, look, we also watched Hillary Clinton ahead in all those [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2744.1s)]
*  polls before 2016. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2750.1s)]
*  Michiganders are an independently minded people. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2752.1s)]
*  We're still ticket splitters, a lot of people. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2755.1s)]
*  So the minute you say, you know, I'm going to be on the sugar high here and think that [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2758.1s)]
*  we're just coasting the victory is the minute you lose. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2762.1s)]
*  And so to me, it wasn't any different than what I've been saying, which is it's terribly [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2765.1s)]
*  close. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2769.1s)]
*  And we're now just within the margin of effort to win this election. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2770.1s)]
*  If we work for it, we're going to win. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2774.1s)]
*  And if we don't work for it, we're not going to win. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2776.1s)]
*  And that's the same in my race. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2778.1s)]
*  That's why you see people out, you know, in Livingston County and in Dexter today and [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2779.1s)]
*  all these folks. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2784.1s)]
*  Yeah, Livingston County. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2785.1s)]
*  And so I just it to me, the minute we get too high on our own supply is the minute we [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2786.1s)]
*  lose here in Michigan. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2793.1s)]
*  You know, you do see a lot of people in Washington who think ticket splitters don't exist. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2795.1s)]
*  It's a figment of our imagination, but you're meeting them out on the trail. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2799.1s)]
*  I mean, not only meeting them. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2802.1s)]
*  I mean, I can't see the audience, but I'm guessing most people here know even in their [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2803.1s)]
*  own families. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2808.1s)]
*  You saw me today ask people like, raise your hand if a relationship with a family member, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2809.1s)]
*  a friend, a colleague, a work partner has become uncomfortable because of politics. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2814.1s)]
*  And everyone in Michigan raised their hand. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2819.1s)]
*  I mean, it really is. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2821.1s)]
*  Thanksgiving dinner has become uncomfortable for a bunch of us. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2822.1s)]
*  And I, you know, represent a district that's very purple. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2826.1s)]
*  Most of my mayors and town supervisors are Republican. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2831.1s)]
*  And they've been sending me pictures of their absentee ballots, which have already gone [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2835.1s)]
*  out. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2841.1s)]
*  And it literally I see them filled in the box for Trump and Slotkin. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2842.1s)]
*  And, you know, we can have a conversation about the Trump part, but the ticket splitter [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2845.1s)]
*  does exist in Michigan or else we wouldn't be the swing state that we are. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2849.1s)]
*  One challenge for President Biden and now for Kamala Harris in Michigan is the uncommitted [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2853.1s)]
*  movement, which is Arab Americans, progressives, a lot of young people who are frustrated about [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2859.1s)]
*  the Biden administration's Gaza policy. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2865.1s)]
*  This group, I think, seems to be expanding to people who have ties to Lebanon, who are [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2868.1s)]
*  concerned about the Israeli ground invasion and airstrikes into Lebanon against Hezbollah. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2872.1s)]
*  Kamala Harris met with Muslim and Arab American voters before her event in Michigan on Friday, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2879.1s)]
*  so yesterday. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2885.1s)]
*  I know you've met with these voters many, many times. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2886.1s)]
*  What do you think they need to see and hear from Vice President Harris to earn back their [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2889.1s)]
*  support? [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2895.1s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, I think it's hard to overstate how this issue has roiled the state of Michigan. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2896.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2902.1s)]
*  And it's, of course, because we have the largest Arab and Muslim American population. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2904.1s)]
*  We have a large Jewish population. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2908.1s)]
*  We have a large student population. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2910.1s)]
*  But it's also because, unlike other places in the country, we're very integrated here. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2912.1s)]
*  We grow up together. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2917.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2918.1s)]
*  My parents' local public high school is literally half Jewish, half Muslim American. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2919.1s)]
*  They have off for the high holidays and for Eid. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2923.1s)]
*  We go to school together. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2925.1s)]
*  We go to the same sport teams. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2926.1s)]
*  We go to the same restaurants. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2927.1s)]
*  And that's an amazing thing. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2929.1s)]
*  An amazing thing. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2932.1s)]
*  And it, but it also makes it so personal when the conflict in the Middle East just literally [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2933.1s)]
*  comes home. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2939.1s)]
*  My dad was in and out of the hospital this year, and every single doctor and specialist [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2940.1s)]
*  was Arab or Muslim American. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2944.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2946.1s)]
*  So it just makes it so personal here. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2947.1s)]
*  And to me, the most important thing that anyone can do, myself included, but certainly Kamala [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2949.1s)]
*  Harris, is you got to keep the lines of communication open. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2955.1s)]
*  That means having hard conversations constantly. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2958.1s)]
*  That means reaching out to people and saying, look, I know you're in pain. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2961.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2965.1s)]
*  I see what's happening. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2966.1s)]
*  The saddest thing about it is that my experience is that the leaders that I talk to on all [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2967.1s)]
*  sides of this, particularly in the Arab and Muslim American community and the Jewish community, [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2972.1s)]
*  are experiencing really the mirror image of the same thing. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2976.1s)]
*  They both feel like the other Americans don't care about my dad. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2980.1s)]
*  They don't care about people who look like me and my children being killed. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2986.1s)]
*  Both communities feel like they're terrified of rising anti-Semitism, of Islamophobia. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2990.1s)]
*  They're worried about what's going on in college campuses. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2996.1s)]
*  They don't know what the future is. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=2999.1s)]
*  Both communities feel that same sense of just anxiousness and hurt. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3001.1s)]
*  So to me, keeping lines of communication open is important for her. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3007.1s)]
*  I was glad she met with people. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3010.1s)]
*  She did that at the last time she was in and the time before that. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3012.1s)]
*  I think that's important. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3015.1s)]
*  But then also, you can be as supportive of the state of Israel as you want and still [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3016.1s)]
*  show empathy for people who are dying. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3022.1s)]
*  And it makes you no less supportive of their security. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3025.1s)]
*  And so expressing that empathy and being willing to listen and learn, I think, are the key [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3030.1s)]
*  things that is my best advice to her on a very, very personal issue here. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3036.1s)]
*  That's good advice. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3040.1s)]
*  I bet a lot of people listening and here tonight are reading and watching the news [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3041.1s)]
*  and just worried about the war expanding and seeming to spiral out of control. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3046.1s)]
*  You've got the Israelis are now hitting targets in Yemen. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3051.1s)]
*  The IDF is launching this ground invasion into Lebanon. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3054.1s)]
*  Iran launched another massive barrage of missiles at Israel. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3057.1s)]
*  We are all now waiting to see what the Israelis do to respond. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3061.1s)]
*  And before you won a congressional seat, you had this really impressive career in [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3064.1s)]
*  the national security world. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3070.1s)]
*  You were the CIA, Department of Defense, a number of big jobs. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3071.1s)]
*  Can you just help people understand what is happening and how worried you are as an expert [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3076.1s)]
*  about things escalating further? [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3082.1s)]
*  Yeah, you know, what we talk about in national security circles is the ladder of escalation, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3085.1s)]
*  right? [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3091.1s)]
*  That you're trying to contain things, but sometimes without your even willingness to [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3092.1s)]
*  do it, it starts to get out of control. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3099.1s)]
*  And that's what I think a lot of us are fearing right now, right? [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3101.1s)]
*  With the expansion into Lebanon, with Iran firing a much more serious barrage of ballistic [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3104.1s)]
*  missiles, including a hypersonic that came through some of the defenses. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3110.1s)]
*  It just, that spiral is happening. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3116.1s)]
*  And I think people feel deeply concerned about it. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3119.1s)]
*  And to me, you know, any country in the world has the right to push back when ballistic [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3124.1s)]
*  missiles are being fired at it. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3130.1s)]
*  But it is just clear to me that we are on the precipice of something much more serious [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3132.1s)]
*  that frankly, as Middle East analysts used to always study in school, like what if we [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3137.1s)]
*  had full on warfare between Iran and Israel and what would happen? [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3143.1s)]
*  So, you know, it's already been a crazy couple of months, year here. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3146.1s)]
*  And I think everyone's just making sure that we don't have that cycle of escalation go [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3153.1s)]
*  completely out of control. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3157.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3159.1s)]
*  Well, hopefully they can get to a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza and start [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3160.1s)]
*  to get things under control. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3163.1s)]
*  Switching gears to Michigan. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3165.1s)]
*  I mean, Donald Trump is trying to use the Biden administration's efforts to combat climate [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3167.1s)]
*  change, especially their support for electric vehicles to drive a wedge between the Democratic [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3172.1s)]
*  Party and auto workers. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3178.1s)]
*  Do you think that effort is working? [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3180.1s)]
*  And if so, how do you think Democrats can convince the UAW, auto workers, people in [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3183.1s)]
*  the industry here in Michigan that clean energy policies aren't going to negatively [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3188.1s)]
*  impact the auto industry? [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3193.1s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, I think the UAW understands this more than most because they're the ones [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3195.1s)]
*  who are staffing the new plants that we're building. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3199.1s)]
*  We have 44 new plants being built in the state of Michigan after 40 years of not a single [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3202.1s)]
*  new plant. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3208.1s)]
*  So and here's the thing. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3209.1s)]
*  I think, you know, the other side has kind of turned this into a completely political [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3212.1s)]
*  issue here in Michigan. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3217.1s)]
*  We don't care what kind of car you want to drive. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3219.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3221.1s)]
*  I live on a farm. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3222.1s)]
*  I live on a dirt road. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3223.1s)]
*  I don't live anywhere near a charging station. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3224.1s)]
*  That's not probably in my immediate future. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3225.1s)]
*  But if the question is who wants to build the next generation of vehicles, you're damn [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3229.1s)]
*  right. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3233.1s)]
*  And I wanted to be Michigan and the United States of America and not China. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3234.1s)]
*  And I think I don't I don't understand the position of the other side. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3239.1s)]
*  They're like China's eating our lunch on this vehicle in China, China, China. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3243.66s)]
*  It's like, right. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3247.1s)]
*  So do you want to do something about it or do you want to just like kick back and watch [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3248.1s)]
*  them do that? [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3252.1s)]
*  And in Michigan, we know what it's like to miss movements on this. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3253.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3257.2999999999997s)]
*  In the 70s and 80s, Michiganders were like, why would anyone drive anything but a huge [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3258.2999999999997s)]
*  vehicle like what are these fuel efficient vehicles you're bringing in from Japan and [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3263.1s)]
*  from Korea? [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3267.5s)]
*  We put it and then they ate our lunch. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3268.5s)]
*  So we don't want to miss this. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3271.7799999999997s)]
*  We don't have to drive them, but we want to build them. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3273.22s)]
*  Well said. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3277.1s)]
*  Let me ask you about your opponent, Mike Rogers. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3280.2999999999997s)]
*  I remember him being a very conservative but not like a total Trump sycophant like some [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3282.74s)]
*  of his colleagues back in 2014, 2015. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3290.74s)]
*  But then he left office, I think, in 2015. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3294.22s)]
*  He became a lobbyist. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3296.8999999999996s)]
*  He moved to Florida, I believe. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3298.8199999999997s)]
*  And then he came back and he's just gone full mega. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3301.1s)]
*  Is this what happened? [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3304.18s)]
*  Is this the price you pay to win a primary in any Senate race now? [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3305.8599999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3310.5s)]
*  I mean, I think the simple answer is the Mike Rogers of 2014 is not the Mike Rogers of 2024. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3311.5s)]
*  I think actually for Michiganders, we understand that there's not going to be only Democrats [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3319.1s)]
*  winning elections. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3325.42s)]
*  We understand that we are a purple state. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3326.42s)]
*  And I think most Michiganders want two healthy parties that debate and push back on each [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3329.2200000000003s)]
*  other about the role of government in our lives and make policy better. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3334.5s)]
*  We dream about that, but that's not what this is. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3338.2200000000003s)]
*  And I think the saddest thing is watching someone who did and was vocal about pushing [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3341.46s)]
*  back at some points about Trump and conspiracies around the 2020 election. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3348.34s)]
*  Now talk about all the shenanigans that are going to happen in southeast Michigan for [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3353.2200000000003s)]
*  this election. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3358.38s)]
*  I mean, laying the predicate along with Trump that if he doesn't win, the elections are [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3359.38s)]
*  rigged, right? [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3364.26s)]
*  Because that's what's happening across the board. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3365.26s)]
*  So it's sad even for me, and I'm running against him. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3367.86s)]
*  It's like watching the last buffalo die. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3370.7000000000003s)]
*  It's very sad. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3372.76s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3374.26s)]
*  It's sad. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3375.26s)]
*  Speaking of dead buffaloes, maybe. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3378.6600000000003s)]
*  Your family's in the meat business and the hot dog business. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3388.34s)]
*  I'm serious. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3393.3s)]
*  You are a Hamas Hezbollah hot dog expert. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3394.3s)]
*  What's the right way to eat a hot dog? [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3398.34s)]
*  Ketchup? [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3400.2200000000003s)]
*  Mustard? [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3401.2200000000003s)]
*  Chili? [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3402.2200000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3403.2200000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3404.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, thank you. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3406.18s)]
*  There are people in the back screaming, a Coney dog. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3407.18s)]
*  Like a Coney. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3409.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3411.06s)]
*  It's a Michigan thing. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3412.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3413.06s)]
*  But, and there's, you know, dueling Coneys in downtown Detroit and right, yeah, Lafayette [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3414.06s)]
*  versus National. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3418.7s)]
*  They're all screaming in the audience. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3419.7s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3420.7s)]
*  It is literally, my preference is a good Albee Frankfurter. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3421.7s)]
*  I personally slice it a little bit, grill it flat. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3425.2999999999997s)]
*  That's me. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3429.62s)]
*  But chili, mustard, little bit of onions if that's your thing. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3430.62s)]
*  And that is what we call a Detroit Coney and you're welcome. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3434.82s)]
*  What do you say to critics who say putting chili on anything is too close to like Skyline [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3442.86s)]
*  chili from Cincinnati? [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3447.7400000000002s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if you're purposely trying to agitate me and or the crowd by mentioning [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3452.26s)]
*  Ohio. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3458.06s)]
*  This is, yeah, Ohio does kind of suck. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3460.42s)]
*  I mean, it just. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3462.78s)]
*  And so no, they can take their chili and suck it in Ohio. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3467.7000000000003s)]
*  Well said. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3472.34s)]
*  I do want to remind everyone that Love It was in Toledo today. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3473.34s)]
*  So last question. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3476.6600000000003s)]
*  You know, we were out with you today. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3480.38s)]
*  We saw people knocking on doors. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3481.5400000000004s)]
*  I know that campaigns need everything at the end, but there's a lot of people here who [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3482.86s)]
*  want to help you out. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3487.3s)]
*  There's a lot of people listening home who want to help you out. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3488.3s)]
*  What should they do? [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3489.78s)]
*  So a couple of things. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3491.42s)]
*  Just do a two hour volunteer shift, literally, especially in this area. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3493.9s)]
*  Just I know it sounds simple, but that simple act of actually engaging other people, they [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3498.9s)]
*  know that you gave a crap about their vote. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3504.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3507.1s)]
*  And just especially in this area, in the Ann Arbor area, the students have the ability to [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3508.1s)]
*  literally decide this election. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3512.5s)]
*  I mean, for the whole country. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3514.1s)]
*  And so doing a two hour shift with us, with the One Campaign, you know, whatever you want. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3516.24s)]
*  And then I think, you know, particularly in this crowd, doing a little social media and [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3522.12s)]
*  being like, you know what, this is what I'm doing. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3527.0s)]
*  This is my plan to vote. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3528.9199999999996s)]
*  Asking people and agitating about whether they're going to vote. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3530.6s)]
*  We know that at University of Michigan, they literally stood outside in 2022 for four hours [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3533.4399999999996s)]
*  to vote on Proposition 3. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3539.56s)]
*  Make it a thing and just talk, talk, talk about it every single day until the election. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3543.96s)]
*  So everyone here has committed, I think, to doing a two hour shift. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3550.32s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3553.7200000000003s)]
*  There we go. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3554.7200000000003s)]
*  Congresswoman Alyssa Slockin, thank you so much for joining the show. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3555.7200000000003s)]
*  How nice would it be to have a U.S. Senator from Michigan who knows the auto industry, [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3559.92s)]
*  who knows foreign policy, who represents and cares about you guys. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3566.08s)]
*  You have the chance to elect her. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3569.3199999999997s)]
*  And can I just say, youngest Democratic woman in the Senate. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3570.72s)]
*  I'm not young. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3576.48s)]
*  I'm young for the Senate. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3577.48s)]
*  Thanks, everybody. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3578.48s)]
*  And we're back. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3579.48s)]
*  All right. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3580.48s)]
*  Now it's time for a game. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3597.52s)]
*  I'm going to divide John, Tommy, Dan, and Leah into teams and quiz them on the absolute [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3599.32s)]
*  chaos, the hodgepodge, the unholy hontish that is the Michigan Republican Party. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3603.0s)]
*  Take a Michigander at these freaks. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3608.64s)]
*  Aka, Austin's parents are in the audience. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3610.96s)]
*  We also have a Michigan based sports game, et cetera. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3616.0s)]
*  All right. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eii4RMxpt4s&t=3620.08s)]
