Video Description: Trump's FBI Director Kash Patel picks a Deputy Director even less qualified than he is: MAGA podcaster Dan Bongino. Trump and Pete Hegseth purge the Pentagon's leadership and lawyers. Elon Musk replies all to the federal government asking what staff have accomplished lately. And, on the three-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Trump declines to call Vladimir Putin a dictator. Jon, Jon, and Tommy discuss the potential for full-blown autocracy at home, Ukraine's predicament, and the latest swing of Musk's bureaucratic chainsaw. Then, Jon talks with NOTUS congressional reporter Daniella Diaz about Trump's legislative agenda, squirmy Republicans, and mounting public anger at Trump's budget cuts.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Trump Names Inexperienced Podcaster Dan Bongino To Be Deputy FBI Director
**Pod Save America:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE)
*  It's MAGA DEI all across the government. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=0.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2.04s)]
*  It is the deepest and most infuriating irony that they have just, they are filling the [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3.04s)]
*  government with people who have no qualifications for the job, save that they are unquestionably [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=7.42s)]
*  loyal to Donald Trump. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=13.22s)]
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=14.6s)]
*  I'm Jon Favreau. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=15.6s)]
*  I'm Jon Lovett. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=16.6s)]
*  I'm Tommy Vitor. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=17.6s)]
*  On today's show, Dan Bongino, a MAGA podcaster who says his life is all about owning the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=18.6s)]
*  libs, is now the deputy director of the FBI. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=22.44s)]
*  We'll talk about why we've always been big fans of his, and we'll cover Trump's Pentagon [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=27.1s)]
*  purge of top generals and military lawyers who he viewed as insufficiently MAGA, I guess. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=31.540000000000003s)]
*  We'll also get into Elon Musk's mass email to every single human employed by the federal [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=36.620000000000005s)]
*  government demanding to know what they did last week or else risk getting fired. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=40.94s)]
*  And later, I'll talk to our friend Daniela Diaz, now a congressional reporter at Notice, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=46.2s)]
*  about whether Trump's legislative agenda is running into trouble with Republicans. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=50.540000000000006s)]
*  But first, Donald Trump held a press conference Monday afternoon with French President Emmanuel [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=55.18s)]
*  Macron on the three year anniversary of Russia invading Ukraine, which to be fair was asking [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=60.620000000000005s)]
*  for it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=66.34s)]
*  According to our new administration, Trump refused to call Putin a dictator, telling [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=67.34s)]
*  a reporter that's a word he doesn't take lightly. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=72.46000000000001s)]
*  Also a word he's now used multiple times to describe the democratically elected Ukrainian [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=75.4s)]
*  President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who said over the weekend that he'd step down if it meant [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=78.94s)]
*  peace for Ukraine. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=84.38s)]
*  Doesn't really sound like something a dictator would do. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=85.61999999999999s)]
*  The US also joined North Korea and other pro-Russian countries, our new gang, in voting against [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=89.89999999999999s)]
*  a UN resolution condemning Russian aggression in Ukraine and calling for all of its territory [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=95.61999999999999s)]
*  to be returned. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=100.46s)]
*  Not even China or Iran voted against the resolution. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=101.82s)]
*  They at least abstained. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=105.3s)]
*  I miss the old days when we only used to do that for the death penalty. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=106.3s)]
*  At the UN? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=110.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=111.82s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=112.82s)]
*  Trump was asked about this and other topics and appearances with Macron on Monday. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=114.25999999999999s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=118.02s)]
*  Can you explain the rationale in having the US vote against the UN resolution that Ukraine [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=119.02s)]
*  proposed and also the US proposed? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=123.02s)]
*  I would rather not explain it now, but it's sort of self-evident, I think. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=125.02s)]
*  Volodymyr Zelenskyy has exited. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=129.01999999999998s)]
*  Would you use the same words without him losing? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=130.01999999999998s)]
*  I don't use those words lightly. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=133.01999999999998s)]
*  I think that we're going to see how it all works out. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=136.01999999999998s)]
*  Let's see what happens. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=139.01999999999998s)]
*  People are saying it was the best month for a president in our country's history. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=140.22s)]
*  I hope that's right, but I feel it's right. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=144.22s)]
*  We've done a lot of things in a very short period of time, four weeks. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=146.22s)]
*  That's part is true. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=150.22s)]
*  Bill Clinton had a pretty good month during that shutdown. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=151.22s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=157.22s)]
*  That took me a minute. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=158.22s)]
*  Leave it to Love It to do a call back to the 90s. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=161.22s)]
*  The simpler time. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=165.22s)]
*  Tommy. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=168.22s)]
*  You know about this stuff. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=169.42s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=171.42s)]
*  Which stuff? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=172.42s)]
*  The real stuff. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=173.42s)]
*  Trump made it sound like they're close to a deal that would end the war. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=175.42s)]
*  There's also been some reporting that maybe Zelenskyy will accept this agreement to give [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=179.42s)]
*  the US 50% of its mineral rights in perpetuity forever in exchange for a, it seems like a [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=183.42s)]
*  vague security promise. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=191.42s)]
*  Awfully vague. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=193.42s)]
*  What do you make of all that? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=194.42s)]
*  It just seems like Zelenskyy's negotiating a gunpoint and he feels like he has no choice. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=195.61999999999998s)]
*  It's as simple as that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=201.61999999999998s)]
*  The war is still raging. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=202.61999999999998s)]
*  I think to honor the anniversary of the full scale invasion, the Russians fired the largest [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=203.61999999999998s)]
*  drone attack since the war started. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=209.92s)]
*  He is getting attacked by the Russians and then now the Americans are coming in to extort [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=212.82s)]
*  him. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=218.01999999999998s)]
*  If I'm Vladimir Putin, why don't I just, I would make this deal and then what's to stop [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=219.62s)]
*  him from a couple years later just saying, all right, I'll go in and get the rest of [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=228.82000000000002s)]
*  Ukraine and first I'll just talk to my new buddy President Trump and be like, hey, you [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=233.42000000000002s)]
*  can keep the mineral rights. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=239.02s)]
*  I'll let you keep those and I'll just go into Ukraine. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=240.62s)]
*  Does that sound good? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=243.42000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=244.42000000000002s)]
*  I think the theory of the, well, first of all, I mean, there was a report in the FT [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=245.82s)]
*  today that Putin said Russia was prepared to offer to help the US on some sort of cooperation [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=249.82s)]
*  on extraction of these minerals. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=254.82s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=256.21999999999997s)]
*  That's so helpful. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=257.21999999999997s)]
*  He wants it on the action. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=258.21999999999997s)]
*  I mean, the kind of Trump theory of the case is that increased economic cooperation might [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=259.62s)]
*  be seen as a deterrent to Putin to invade again. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=265.41999999999996s)]
*  I don't think that's remotely credible. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=269.21999999999997s)]
*  But I think it's very likely that Putin is viewing this as a chance to refresh his army [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=271.22s)]
*  and rearm and then try to take the rest of Ukraine in a couple of years. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=277.42s)]
*  Were you shocked by the UN resolution? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=282.22s)]
*  I mean, yes, but no. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=284.82000000000005s)]
*  Right? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=286.42s)]
*  I mean, we've picked a side and I think the UN resolution just showed how much of a change [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=287.42s)]
*  there's been in US policy. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=293.02000000000004s)]
*  At least our stalwart ally Israel voted with us as well. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=294.22s)]
*  Oh, nice. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=297.82000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=298.82000000000005s)]
*  You guys have a better plan to get all the graphite we need. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=299.82000000000005s)]
*  I'd love to hear it. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=301.42s)]
*  Wasn't there another resolution that the US had proposed that was sort of like there's [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=302.42s)]
*  been blame on both sides that we had to withdraw? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=307.12s)]
*  Yeah, it was like we very much mourn all the deaths in the conflicts between the Russian [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=309.21999999999997s)]
*  Federation and Ukraine or something like that. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=315.71999999999997s)]
*  That's like the common thread. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=317.78s)]
*  I mean, Trump refuses to say the Russians invaded. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=318.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=320.82s)]
*  Refuses to say who's the aggressor. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=321.82s)]
*  Very Charlottesville coded. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=323.78s)]
*  It's definitely. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=324.78s)]
*  There were also German elections on Sunday where the extreme right AFD party, which Elon's [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=326.73999999999995s)]
*  been boosting and JD Vance met with, came in second place with a little over 20 percent [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=330.85999999999996s)]
*  of the vote. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=335.78s)]
*  Tell me what's your take on the results there? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=336.78s)]
*  Very bad. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=339.46s)]
*  The AFD doubled its support from the last time. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=340.46s)]
*  It seems like they took votes from the two main parties, the AFD and the SPD. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=342.58s)]
*  But most of their success came from mobilizing new voters. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=347.78s)]
*  It just tells you there's a lot of energy there. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=350.17999999999995s)]
*  So there's some AFD voters who support their really disgusting policy views. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=353.58s)]
*  I think there's some people that view it as a way to give a middle finger to the system [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=357.38s)]
*  and just show a protest. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=361.22s)]
*  I've heard that before. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=362.58s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=364.3s)]
*  The more traditional conservatives, they got the most votes, but they underperformed. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=365.3s)]
*  The social Democrats had the worst result for them since 1887. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=369.46000000000004s)]
*  So tough day for Schultz, former Chancellor Schultz. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=374.38s)]
*  So it's most likely that Friedrich Merritt in the CDU will go to coalition with the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=378.06s)]
*  social Democrats. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=382.18s)]
*  And that's the next government. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=383.18s)]
*  And that's kind of the best possible outcome in terms of what's next for Germany, in terms [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=384.46s)]
*  of their ability to govern. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=389.46s)]
*  What's the worst, Tommy? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=390.90000000000003s)]
*  The worst is they form a government, they can't get anything done. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=393.22s)]
*  It collapses. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=397.5s)]
*  And then in the next election, you see the AFD do even better because the real growth [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=398.66s)]
*  in this election was on the far right for the AFD and on the far left, especially among [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=403.1s)]
*  18 to 24 year olds. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=408.54s)]
*  The far left and the far right did really well because everyone is just furious at the [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=410.70000000000005s)]
*  two traditional political parties. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=413.86s)]
*  And now we just have to see if they can form a government that seems responsive to the [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=416.38s)]
*  people. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=422.46000000000004s)]
*  And it seems like their far left party, which I think got like 9%, which was like it had [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=423.46000000000004s)]
*  crossed the 5% threshold and it like more than doubled its support from last time. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=428.58000000000004s)]
*  And they're sort of they seem they're skeptical of NATO and supporting Ukraine, just like [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=433.86s)]
*  the AFD. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=439.18s)]
*  So you can see some some horseshoe stuff happening. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=440.42s)]
*  Yeah, they're Euro skeptics. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=442.54s)]
*  And so that's worrisome in the long term. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=444.3s)]
*  And then Friedrich Merz, who's the head of the CDU, which is Angela Merkel's party, he [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=446.26s)]
*  said during the campaign that his top priority is going to be strengthening Europe as quickly [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=450.7s)]
*  as possible so they can achieve independence from the United States because they know the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=454.18s)]
*  Americans are now largely indifferent to Europe's fate. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=457.42s)]
*  And he also said that you won must interference in German elections was not less dramatic [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=461.06s)]
*  and drastic than what Russia did. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=465.26s)]
*  So they're just viewing a future without us. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=466.82s)]
*  Wonderful. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=469.90000000000003s)]
*  As is Zelensky. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=470.90000000000003s)]
*  Wonderful. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=471.90000000000003s)]
*  So now that we've covered authoritarian movements abroad, let's talk about our authoritarian [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=472.90000000000003s)]
*  takeover here at home. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=476.46000000000004s)]
*  It's just like our just like our state of the union transitions from. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=478.02000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=482.74s)]
*  As the United States is strong at home, so are we strong abroad as the social order collapses [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=484.26s)]
*  around the world. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=489.5s)]
*  New FBI director Cash Patel has named Dan Bongino as his deputy director. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=490.5s)]
*  In case you aren't familiar, Bongino is a former Secret Service agent and New York City [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=496.90000000000003s)]

*  All the favorites. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=509.18s)]
*  He's called the FBI irredeemably corrupt, accused the FBI of rigging the twenty twenty [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=510.66s)]
*  and twenty sixteen elections. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=516.22s)]
*  Got to get both of them in there. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=518.38s)]
*  Suggested that the FBI played a role in the pipe bombs that were placed outside the RNC [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=519.7s)]
*  on January 6th and said it's time to quote clean house at the bureau. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=525.38s)]
*  You'll be surprised to know he doesn't seem like the world's nicest guy. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=529.7800000000001s)]
*  Here's a selection of a recorded phone interview with reporter Mark Caputo now at Axios. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=532.4200000000001s)]

*  Fuck yourself. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=543.7800000000001s)]
*  OK. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=544.7800000000001s)]
*  You hear me? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=545.7800000000001s)]
*  You're a piece of shit. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=546.7800000000001s)]

*  Go fuck yourself. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=550.7800000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=551.7800000000001s)]
*  Well, enjoy that investigation. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=552.86s)]
*  Mark Caputo. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=556.54s)]
*  What do you guys think? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=557.54s)]
*  Right man for the job? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=559.3s)]
*  First of all, Dan Magino to be deputy director of the FBI feels like a bad joke from like [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=560.5799999999999s)]
*  2015. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=566.5799999999999s)]
*  It's like out of it. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=567.5799999999999s)]
*  Just like it's a beyond parody. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=569.5s)]
*  So this job is not only not Senate confirmed, it's the highest ranking job of the FBI. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=571.78s)]
*  The president doesn't appoint. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=577.9s)]
*  It's a job because it's a real job. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=581.1s)]
*  It's a real operations job. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=583.5799999999999s)]
*  It's not like a glad handing press conference job. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=584.5799999999999s)]
*  It's a COO type job. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=586.9599999999999s)]
*  You oversee. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=588.3599999999999s)]
*  This is why you need Dan Bongino. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=589.3599999999999s)]
*  This is why you need Dan Bongino. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=591.3599999999999s)]
*  Look, I'm preferring to see the word podcaster rather than MAGA podcaster. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=592.76s)]
*  Why aren't we standing with podcasters? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=598.0799999999999s)]
*  We could get any job we want now next administration. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=601.28s)]
*  We couldn't even get them on the fucking show. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=603.28s)]
*  They got podcasters in the fucking FBI now? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=607.0799999999999s)]
*  Egg on our face. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=609.12s)]
*  We couldn't even get a guest. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=610.12s)]
*  Yeah, we blew it. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=611.12s)]
*  Sam, I don't care what's happening with the Democratic nominee next time. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=612.5600000000001s)]
*  We are just absolutely. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=614.72s)]
*  That's right. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=617.28s)]
*  Yeah, we're not in the tank enough. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=618.28s)]
*  But so the other thing too is this is a job where you're involved in investigations earlier [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=619.28s)]
*  and in more detail than the FBI director, which is why it's been a job that was traditionally [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=624.16s)]
*  for a career FBI official. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=628.84s)]
*  And it's a job of someone you've never heard of the people that have done these jobs in [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=633.36s)]
*  the past. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=636.08s)]
*  The only two that you've heard of are Mark Felt because he was deep throat and Andrew [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=637.08s)]
*  McCabe because he got fired. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=641.1999999999999s)]
*  And that kind of tells you where we're at, right? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=643.04s)]
*  Because Donald Trump wants someone loyal to him in that job, even if it means not having [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=645.0s)]
*  the kind of person who knows how to run an investigation at the FBI when it has nothing [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=651.4599999999999s)]
*  to do with politics, nothing to do with investigating your enemies, just the day to day work of [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=656.1999999999999s)]
*  investigating terrorist cases and other crimes and corruption and all the other cases that [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=659.68s)]
*  the FBI has to get behind. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=663.8399999999999s)]
*  Because Pekash Patel, who of course we also love and have always loved, another big podcast [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=666.28s)]
*  guy told the FBI Agents Association, according to CNN, a bunch of woke libs that he was going [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=673.32s)]
*  to put a career person in that job that he was going to choose from the FBI ranks for [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=680.1600000000001s)]
*  that job until the FBI refused to go along with Emile Boves, witch hunt of agents at [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=684.48s)]
*  the FBI that were involved in the investigations around January 6. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=691.8000000000001s)]
*  The FBI refused to coordinate with the Trump DOJ. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=695.52s)]
*  By the way, Boves is not just a Trump. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=699.32s)]
*  Boves is a Boves. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=701.24s)]
*  Is it Boves? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=702.24s)]
*  It's apparently what Andrew Weisman says. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=703.24s)]
*  That's very French. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=705.88s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=706.88s)]
*  But he was Trump's lawyer. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=707.88s)]
*  Now a DOJ trying to demand these names. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=710.36s)]
*  And the second they had this kind of resistance, all of a sudden they're like, oh, we need [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=711.96s)]
*  somebody that's not a career official. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=714.5600000000001s)]
*  We need Dan motherfucking Bongino. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=716.16s)]
*  As you could hear there, he's got some temperament issues. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=720.4s)]
*  Think if an anabolic steroid morphed into a person, it would be Dan Bongino. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=724.64s)]
*  And fortunately, when you give people power, usually they settle that. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=729.08s)]
*  Yeah, they chill out. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=731.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=732.48s)]
*  And to love it's point is right about the experience. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=733.48s)]
*  I mean, the deputy director is always a career FBI agent. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=735.56s)]
*  When we were in the administration, this guy Sean Joyce, who had one of the best Boston [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=739.36s)]
*  accidents I've ever heard, but he had been in the bureau for like 30 or 40 years. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=742.28s)]
*  He did all these operational meetings. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=746.4s)]
*  He was deep in the weeds of everything. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=748.32s)]
*  He was always briefing the deputies committee. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=749.92s)]
*  Dan Bongino has none of that experience. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=751.52s)]
*  He was a Secret Service guy turned gadfly political candidate turned Fox News host [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=753.52s)]
*  turned podcaster. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=759.24s)]
*  And I think this is even more dangerous this time around because Cash Patel has no experience. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=761.4399999999999s)]
*  He's never worked at the FBI. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=766.56s)]
*  He's like, what, 44 years old? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=767.56s)]
*  He's like a little bit of experience on the Hill and a little bit of time at the DOJ, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=769.36s)]
*  but he doesn't know what he's doing. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=773.36s)]
*  And so I'm not like I know one of those people that you see a lot of liberals kind of lionizing [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=774.92s)]
*  the FBI. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=781.16s)]
*  Like how dare you criticize the institutions? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=782.16s)]
*  No, they've made a lot of mistakes. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=783.4799999999999s)]
*  They screw up a lot of stuff. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=784.7199999999999s)]
*  It's an incredibly conservative organization, by the way, very Republican. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=785.7199999999999s)]
*  But this is the FBI is supposed to protect us from terrorists, foreign intelligence operations, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=790.04s)]
*  organized crime. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=796.3199999999999s)]
*  They're not just raiding Mar-a-Lago. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=797.3199999999999s)]
*  That's not their only job. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=798.3199999999999s)]
*  And now it's run by two people have no idea what they're doing. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=800.4799999999999s)]
*  And like the only explanation for how they got the job is loyalty to Trump. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=802.64s)]
*  And you know, if if I would think of the two parts of government, you could most easily [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=806.28s)]
*  weaponize against political opponents. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=810.0999999999999s)]
*  It would be the FBI and the IRS just giving the kind of tools you have in your toolkit. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=811.8199999999999s)]
*  Well, as you said, also think about malign foreign actors or terrorists or criminals, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=817.66s)]
*  right, who now see that the FBI is led by the two least experienced people in the bureau's [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=824.18s)]
*  history, that it is probably consumed with political ambition. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=830.54s)]
*  You know, how much are they going to be able to focus on domestic terrorism, crime, all [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=837.42s)]
*  the other things that they're supposed to be doing? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=843.06s)]
*  There's thirty eight thousand employees at the FBI. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=844.8199999999999s)]
*  They couldn't find one person, let alone two people, to run the thing that had been agents [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=847.14s)]
*  before. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=852.4599999999999s)]
*  It's an eleven billion dollar agency that now two people who have never been FBI agents, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=853.4599999999999s)]
*  one was a New York City cop and the other was a lawyer at the Justice Department for [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=859.38s)]
*  a time. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=864.62s)]
*  That was it. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=865.62s)]
*  I remember after 9-11, it was a very big deal that the FBI and the DOJ moved terrorism ahead [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=867.58s)]
*  of corruption as the number one focus. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=874.74s)]
*  It was like it was a big deal. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=877.38s)]
*  And it's a reminder to you that like outside of politics, like how much we rely on, you [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=879.98s)]
*  know, just the fear of an investigation by the FBI into public corruption, like corruption [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=886.7s)]
*  is a cancer. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=891.22s)]
*  Donald Trump is cancer. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=892.22s)]
*  The corruption that they are, that is already sort of going to make America worse for decades. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=893.34s)]
*  But all across the country are people seeing that now this FBI is going to be beholden [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=899.98s)]
*  to the most corrupt president we've ever had. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=904.14s)]
*  And even if you put aside all the ways in which they could be proactively terrible, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=906.94s)]
*  proactively going against their enemies, which I'm obviously afraid they're going to do, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=911.3000000000001s)]
*  it is the things they will not care about, the things they will ignore, the things that [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=915.5400000000001s)]
*  this sends a message to people around the country that they don't care about, that is [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=919.46s)]
*  so incredibly fucking dangerous in ways we may not know. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=922.3399999999999s)]
*  We may not know for years. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=925.2199999999999s)]
*  We may not know ever the damage that this does. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=926.2199999999999s)]
*  Former senior FBI official Christopher O'Leary told NBC, we now have two conspiracy theorists [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=928.78s)]
*  and election deniers running our premier law enforcement and intelligence agency. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=933.4599999999999s)]
*  One FBI official told NBC, I didn't sleep and I want to pack my desk today. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=938.42s)]
*  And another said it's like bringing on Alex Jones or Oath Keepers leader Stuart Rhodes. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=942.62s)]
*  And by the way, Dan Bongino has supported the Oath Keepers in the past. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=946.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, last night was one of those times where I sort of thought to myself, if we were slowly [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=950.26s)]
*  sliding into an authoritarian state, what would be happening differently than a purge [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=955.34s)]
*  of the FBI and the Pentagon? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=960.74s)]
*  Did you see that the U.S. attorney for D.C., who is also Trump's former lawyer, Ed Martin, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=963.5s)]
*  put out this ridiculous statement saying, as President Trump's lawyers, we are proud [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=969.0600000000001s)]
*  to fight to protect his leadership as our president and we are vigilant in standing [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=972.9s)]
*  against entities like the AP that refuse to put America first. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=976.1s)]
*  First of all, I just want to note he put the apostrophe on the wrong side of the fucking [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=980.02s)]
*  S. So it's Trump's apostrophe, which is the least offensive piece of the statement. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=983.42s)]
*  Obviously, he's not Trump's lawyers. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=989.42s)]
*  This guy to me went from scary and I think he's still as scary in that position because [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=991.78s)]
*  that position holds a lot of power to like he's like a little thirsty to for Trump to [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=996.46s)]
*  see him and be like, hey, look what I'm doing. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1001.74s)]
*  I'm posting quote graphics on on on Twitter all the time telling you like, hey, hey, Mr. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1003.6999999999999s)]
*  Trump, I'm here for you. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1009.58s)]
*  Like I'm I think that there are probably like Trump supplicants in his administration who [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1010.6600000000001s)]
*  are looking at Ed Martin's tweets and statements and are like that. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1015.0200000000001s)]
*  Honestly, that's too much. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1017.46s)]

*  Trump didn't give a reason for firing Brown, who was the first black American to serve [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1170.38s)]
*  in the role. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1173.2600000000002s)]

*  As for the JAGS, Hegseth said they quote, existed to attempt to be roadblocks to anything [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1178.42s)]
*  that happens in his book. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1183.34s)]
*  He called them JAG OFFS and blamed them for being a bunch of prudes who insisted on rules [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1185.3s)]

*  It's just fucking terrifying, right? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1216.22s)]
*  This is about, you know, you're talking about the possibility of deploying the military [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1217.74s)]
*  in ways that are illegal on US soil and then not having anyone at the FBI or the DOJ that's [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1223.38s)]

*  We don't know how far they'll go, but they're setting up the possibility that they can go [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1232.66s)]
*  as far as they want. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1237.9s)]
*  And that is terrifying. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1238.9s)]
*  I just want to point out that before Seeky Brown was the chairman, he commanded the Pacific [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1239.9s)]
*  Air Forces. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1245.04s)]
*  He was the chief of staff of the Air Force. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1246.04s)]
*  He was the deputy commander of CENTCOM. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1247.28s)]
*  He logged 130 hours in combat. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1249.24s)]
*  This guy was like eminently qualified for the job. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1250.96s)]
*  And he was fired because he is black. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1255.06s)]
*  Pete Hegseth, as you mentioned, sort of questioned in his book whether Brown had been promoted [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1256.8400000000001s)]
*  because of his race. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1262.56s)]
*  Hegseth later said on a podcast, I think last year, that Brown had to be fired because [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1264.3999999999999s)]
*  any general involved in quote, DEI woke shit has to go. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1269.8s)]
*  In Seeky Brown's case, that meant literally just like talking about his experience as [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1275.3999999999999s)]
*  a black man in the United States after George Floyd's murder. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1279.24s)]
*  And then you mentioned the head of the Navy was fired. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1283.28s)]
*  That was Lisa Franchetti. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1285.6s)]
*  She was the first woman to lead the Navy. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1287.06s)]
*  About a month ago, Trump fired the commandant of the Coast Guard, who was the first woman [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1289.04s)]
*  ever to lead a branch of the US military. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1293.8999999999999s)]
*  So they're just pushing out all women and all people of color. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1295.9799999999998s)]
*  And again, as we talked about before, like the military is very diverse at the lowest [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1299.1s)]
*  ranks at the senior level. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1302.74s)]
*  It is almost exclusively white men. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1304.02s)]
*  And Trump is just destroying any diversity that had been improved by the Biden administration. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1307.1999999999998s)]
*  And as these guys are ranting and raving about DEI, they are putting Pete Hegseth in charge, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1314.9399999999998s)]
*  who is a weekend Fox anchor. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1320.82s)]
*  And then Lieutenant General Dan Cain is going to be the replacement chairman. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1323.46s)]
*  He's the guy that Trump always talks about, Raisin Cain, who he met in Iraq, who said [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1328.5s)]
*  I can kill ISIS in like two hours, whatever, blah, blah, blah. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1332.46s)]
*  Cain doesn't actually meet the statutory requirements needed to hold the position. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1335.7s)]
*  He was a three star. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1339.9s)]
*  You needed to have been a combatant commander or a service chief. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1340.9s)]
*  Trump can give him a waiver. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1344.3400000000001s)]
*  But again, the idea that this is like a fucking merit based appointment is ludicrous on the [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1345.74s)]
*  facts. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1350.38s)]
*  It's MAGA DEI all across the government. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1351.38s)]
*  It is the deepest and most infuriating irony that they have just they are filling the government [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1352.78s)]
*  with people who have no qualifications for the job, save that they are unquestionably [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1358.2199999999998s)]
*  loyal to Donald Trump. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1363.6599999999999s)]
*  It is the only hope right now that like the federal government will talk about what Elon [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1365.06s)]
*  is doing in a minute. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1371.2199999999998s)]
*  But like the federal government is a big, complicated beast. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1372.2199999999998s)]
*  And you're putting in these people like Dan Bongino and Cash Patel and and you're at [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1375.6599999999999s)]
*  Pete Hegseth that are just unqualified with and don't have the organizational experience [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1380.22s)]
*  to actually change these places. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1385.3s)]
*  That is going to be part of the hope that that their inability to do what they want [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1387.34s)]
*  to do and the chaos in which they do it is a kind of protection because they are putting [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1390.5s)]
*  unqualified people in whose only qualification is that they're willing to do whatever Donald [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1393.8600000000001s)]
*  Trump wants. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1396.98s)]
*  You said that Mark Milley, the former chairman, should be executed. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1397.98s)]
*  So I guess it could be worse. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1400.82s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1401.82s)]
*  I do. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1402.82s)]
*  He's going to have to go hide with Mark Caputo. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1403.82s)]

*  I'm sure people have listened to this section or like, why the fuck are you bumming us out [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1409.1799999999998s)]

*  Because this is these are appointments that, you know, unlike some of the Doge cuts and [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1417.2199999999998s)]
*  the town halls that we're seeing, like it's going to be hard to reverse. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1422.62s)]
*  I wonder what the thirty eight thousand employees at the FBI, the the United States military, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1425.82s)]
*  all the people who serve honorably in this country, like what they do and like, I don't [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1434.66s)]

*  Do you stay? [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1441.22s)]

*  decision to speak out? [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1449.42s)]
*  Like I just don't know what you do at this point, but I feel I really feel for all these [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1450.7s)]
*  people because I do think there are enough of them that if they, you know, if they stand [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1454.34s)]
*  up to some really unlawful or un-American orders, then, you know, they could they could [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1459.06s)]
*  make a difference. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1465.54s)]

*  Yeah, like it would be nice if there were some resolution we could talk about here. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1470.86s)]
*  It's a very terrible situation. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1473.58s)]
*  We're going to be in it for some time. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1474.78s)]
*  One of the reasons you have to talk about it is we have to make sure we're talking about [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1475.8999999999999s)]
*  this and and representing what the truth is here because there are tens of thousands of [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1478.54s)]
*  people serving under these leaders who need to know that they're not crazy. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1483.06s)]
*  The world has gone crazy and that there will like just because every Senate Republican [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1488.18s)]
*  has failed the greatest test of their life, even though they've ever gone to fucking every [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1492.8600000000001s)]
*  vacation. You know, every Republican senator, every vacation they've ever had, they've read [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1496.5800000000002s)]
*  a read a World War Two book and a Churchill book. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1500.26s)]
*  And then they're in the test of their lives and they don't see it like they may all be [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1502.7s)]
*  failing. But there's going to be other times we're going to expect or hope that that people [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1505.5400000000002s)]
*  in roles like this don't fail. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1510.38s)]

*  But that's where we're at. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1514.22s)]
*  You know, just I feel for these workforces because you're damned if you do, you're damned [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1515.5s)]
*  if you don't. I mean, you have to either you stay in, you maybe have to go along with [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1519.06s)]
*  something because you're ordered to that, you know, it's wrong either morally or legally, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1523.02s)]
*  or you leave and potentially someone worse and more loyal to Trump gets your job. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1527.1399999999999s)]

*  It's terrible. Or there's malicious compliance, which is a term that the MAGA folks have [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1533.74s)]
*  invented for people who are saying what they aren't able to do anymore. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1539.1s)]
*  Like, you know, just like, oh, we had a Black History Month celebration that we weren't [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1544.3799999999999s)]

*  cancel it. This is their new thing. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1553.66s)]
*  Every time something happens, it's really unpopular. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1555.62s)]
*  That's due to something that the Trump administration did. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1558.1s)]

*  Donald Trump cannot fail. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1563.54s)]
*  He can only be failed. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1564.98s)]
*  Right. That is that is the world we live in. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1566.1s)]
*  He's always a victim. Yeah. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1567.46s)]
*  All right. Let's talk about the fourth branch of government. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1568.9s)]
*  Elon Musk, who was last seen wielding a chainsaw at CPAC while wearing sunglasses [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1570.58s)]
*  indoors and mumbling about how he's, quote, living the meme, living the dream, and [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1575.22s)]
*  has helped legalize comedy again. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1580.06s)]
*  He sure has. Sure has. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1582.42s)]
*  Trump posted on Truth Social that he thinks Elon is doing a great job, but that he [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1583.82s)]
*  wants him to, quote, get more aggressive. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1587.26s)]
*  Musk then tweeted a screenshot of that post with the message, will do, Mr. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1590.14s)]
*  President. Three hours later, Elon tweeted that all federal employees, all two [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1593.34s)]
*  million of them would be getting an email asking them to explain what they, quote, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1597.5s)]
*  got done last week and that if they didn't respond, it would be considered a [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1601.5s)]
*  resignation. By Saturday evening, that email had gone out, giving people until [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1605.18s)]
*  midnight on Monday night to respond with five bullets about their accomplishments. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1608.94s)]
*  But almost immediately, the heads of some major government agencies, including the [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1613.5s)]
*  Defense Department, the State Department, the Justice Department and Cash Patel, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1616.6200000000001s)]
*  started telling employees that they didn't need to respond or at least not yet. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1620.78s)]
*  NBC News reported that Elon's plan is to feed the responses into an [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1624.74s)]
*  AI system to determine which job should be eliminated. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1629.1799999999998s)]
*  But right before we recorded, the White House Office of Personnel Management [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1632.5s)]
*  notified all agencies that actually responding to the email is voluntary [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1636.1399999999999s)]
*  and employees won't be fired if they refuse to answer. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1641.1s)]
*  What do we think happened here? [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1644.74s)]
*  I mean, I'm no AI expert, but the idea that you can just put a five [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1646.6999999999998s)]
*  paragraph like what I did at camp this week letter into the machine and it can [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1651.74s)]
*  just tell you if your job as value seems like it's the like it's the machine that [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1655.98s)]
*  that checks whether kids are good or good or evil and really wonka. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1659.5s)]
*  It's like look at the five bullets and be like, I saw a D, I saw an E and I saw [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1662.9s)]
*  an I. You're right. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1666.54s)]
*  There's a have you guys ever heard of something called Rocco's Basilisk? [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1667.42s)]
*  No, of course I have. Yes. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1670.82s)]
*  Love the love of Basilisk. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1672.14s)]
*  Rocco's Basilisk was a post on a web forum, and the post said the following. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1673.66s)]
*  If at some point in a distant future, there is a super intelligent AI that is [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1678.06s)]
*  ultimately benevolent and wants the best for us, it will also believe that the [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1682.1s)]
*  sooner it is invented, the better. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1686.1399999999999s)]
*  But it can't go back in time and make us invent this AI faster. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1688.58s)]
*  But what it can do is if in this future it can see who helped bring it about and [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1693.8999999999999s)]
*  who didn't. And the people who brought it about will be rewarded. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1698.3799999999999s)]
*  The people who didn't bring it about will be punished. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1701.02s)]
*  You can introduce that into the past by having someone like me at this table. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1703.82s)]
*  Explain this. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1707.46s)]
*  Now that I've explained it, you know that in the future, the super advanced AI [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1708.74s)]
*  will punish all those that didn't bring it out into existence. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1713.26s)]
*  And so because you now know that you have now you now face your test and your test [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1717.26s)]
*  is whether you will do everything you can to bring it about. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1721.78s)]
*  Now, the problem is you don't know whether what you're in right now is real or a [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1724.26s)]
*  simulation of that test. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1727.58s)]
*  But either way, either way, you now know that you either have to choose to help [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1729.46s)]
*  bring about this AI or potentially face an eternity in some kind of simulated [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1734.86s)]
*  hell. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1739.3799999999999s)]
*  It is very clear that you have not been raised Catholic because this is the basis [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1740.3799999999999s)]
*  for my religion. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1744.5s)]
*  The point being, and I wish the pope well, I think this is how is the pope doing [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1749.62s)]
*  slight improvement today? We can't lose the pope. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1755.5s)]
*  Not right now. I know. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1757.6599999999999s)]
*  Alternatives are not good. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1759.3799999999999s)]
*  And so every once in a while he refers to people as some kind of like freccio [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1760.4199999999998s)]
*  Cheney or something, whatever he was referring to. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1763.06s)]
*  So do you. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1765.34s)]
*  Yeah, so me and the pope. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1766.34s)]
*  Pope. Conclay. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1767.74s)]
*  Three pods in a row now. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1769.02s)]
*  Really? I think so. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1770.26s)]
*  Wow. Keeping track. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1771.34s)]
*  When do I get my free sub? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1772.4199999999998s)]
*  Anyway, the point is, when I saw they were feeding this into AI, I thought Elon knows [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1774.6599999999999s)]
*  what Rocco's Basculus is. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1777.94s)]
*  And I think that if you are going to respond voluntarily, I think you should talk about [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1779.1399999999999s)]
*  the fact that you're open to bringing about the super intelligent AI. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1782.4199999999998s)]
*  I listened to our friend Sarah Longwell's focus group podcast this weekend, as I [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1785.94s)]
*  always do. She had our other friend Kara Swisher on. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1791.02s)]
*  And Kara floated a theory that now is keeping me up at night, which is that the real [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1794.5s)]
*  reason that Elon wants access to all the data, to all the data in the government, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1799.62s)]
*  the personal data, personal info, the social security numbers, the employee data is [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1805.54s)]
*  because he wants to feed it into an AI LLM because he has fallen behind the other [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1809.54s)]
*  LLMs and the only data left because basically a lot of the AI systems now have run out [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1818.82s)]
*  of data because we fed them all all the data that there is publicly available and that [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1823.62s)]
*  the two entities with the most data left over that haven't been fed into AI is the [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1827.62s)]
*  Chinese government and us, the U.S. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1831.46s)]
*  government. And so ultimately, Elon and the Doge boys want to export the data to an AI [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1833.7s)]
*  machine. And I was like, that sounds like something out of a fucking horror movie. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1839.62s)]
*  But and I want to say, obviously, that's crazy. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1845.1399999999999s)]
*  But I don't I don't know. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1847.62s)]
*  Look at look at everything we've talked about today. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1849.3799999999999s)]
*  So we can make better pictures of fish. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1851.06s)]
*  No, I look, I'm sure there are terrifying ways in which I think the data can be [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1854.54s)]
*  exploited in a million terrifying ways. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1857.6599999999999s)]
*  I didn't know to be afraid of that one. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1859.3s)]
*  And I guess I'll figure out why to be more afraid of it. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1860.6599999999999s)]
*  But I'm much more afraid of him just digging around looking for information on people [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1862.4199999999998s)]
*  that have tweeted negative things about him than I am about him feeding it into [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1865.02s)]
*  fucking grok so that it can pump out an answer about why why Parcheese exists. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1867.7s)]
*  Just save it as a dot CSV file. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1874.06s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1876.02s)]
*  I think it's just a dot CSV. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1877.1000000000001s)]
*  What is it? Roko co-basis is Roko's a Baskely Roko's Baskely. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1878.94s)]
*  That's you on the drug dealer. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1882.8200000000002s)]
*  Elon has talked about Roko's Baskely. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1884.18s)]
*  It's it's it's tied into this idea of whether or not we live in a simulation. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1886.02s)]
*  Yes, it's interesting that the agency heads, the cabinet officials who are all as [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1889.06s)]
*  magas as they come, obviously push back on this one a little bit. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1894.22s)]
*  I saw some reporting from Jeff Stine at the Washington Post that, you know, it's not [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1898.22s)]
*  necessarily like they disagree with Elon's overall vision or tactics here. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1901.42s)]
*  They just are sort of like, maybe we slow things down here and maybe this is the best [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1906.18s)]
*  way to call the workforce with with an AI LLM that's just right. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1909.74s)]
*  It's self-evidently stupid. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1913.74s)]
*  Is that also like at some point you're the secretary of filling the agency name [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1916.18s)]
*  education. You're ostensibly running the thing. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1920.5s)]
*  You're supposed to be in charge. You want your little fiefdom to be yours. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1923.3400000000001s)]
*  You want to decide who you're hiring and firing. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1926.26s)]
*  So I think there's probably just an ego piece of it. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1928.5800000000002s)]
*  There also seemed like a legal part. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1930.3799999999999s)]
*  Well, there's a there's a legal part. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1932.06s)]
*  There's also they they know that they have been firing people, that Elon's been [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1933.74s)]
*  firing people so far that they've had to rehire, like the people who secure our [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1937.6999999999998s)]
*  nukes and the people who are fighting bird flu. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1941.8999999999999s)]
*  Like there's just agency after agency now. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1944.4199999999998s)]
*  They are firing people. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1946.6599999999999s)]
*  Elon and Doge are going there firing people who then later they all realize, oh, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1947.8999999999999s)]
*  shit, we actually need those workers. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1951.62s)]
*  And then they try to hire them back. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1953.02s)]
*  In some cases, they can't hire them back because they can't find their fucking [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1954.26s)]
*  contact info. And the email this time went. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1957.06s)]
*  It not only went to everyone in the federal government, like in all these [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1959.8200000000002s)]
*  agencies and in the Trump administration, it went to everyone in the judiciary. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1964.3000000000002s)]
*  It went to like judges got this email. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1967.8200000000002s)]
*  Federal judges. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1970.78s)]
*  We can't fire judges yet. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1971.66s)]
*  But yeah, wild. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1972.7s)]
*  But yeah, it does seem like it does seem like just like a little bit of normal [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1975.8600000000001s)]
*  politics is poking through. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1980.5s)]
*  Like these Republicans are getting hammered at these town halls. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1981.8200000000002s)]
*  Like there's clearly interior like Republican blowback from the agencies. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1985.6200000000001s)]
*  They're saying don't respond to this. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1989.18s)]
*  I mean, the other thing about this, too, is it's like part of it is like you can [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1990.94s)]
*  imagine like a more like competence does matter, like not doing this in a chaotic [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1994.8600000000001s)]
*  way does matter. This is something that the Trump administration. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=1998.9s)]
*  Well, they did. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2001.38s)]
*  They did learn this right. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2002.34s)]
*  Project 2025. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2003.26s)]
*  One of the lessons it was supposed to learn from the first Trump [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2004.66s)]
*  administration was that they really paid for some of the chaos because doing [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2007.3s)]
*  things in a hectic way without being fully baked, got them pushed back in the [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2011.18s)]
*  courts, got them blow back in the press, and they were going to do this better. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2015.22s)]
*  And I do think Russ Vought would do this better than Elon Musk. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2017.82s)]
*  But Elon Musk is doing it like this. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2020.54s)]
*  You can like Mark Warner even posted this. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2021.7s)]
*  Like there is a way that you could do a hey, like we're doing a review of what [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2023.1399999999999s)]
*  different agencies are doing. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2026.3s)]
*  We're going to interview everybody or get get information from everybody about [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2027.34s)]
*  what they're doing. But it's in this sort of cavalier and careless and mean [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2030.7s)]
*  spirited way. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2034.26s)]
*  It seems like you accidentally reply at all. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2035.7s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2038.22s)]
*  Maybe he maybe accidentally reply. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2038.78s)]
*  Oh, I do think these you mentioned the town halls. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2040.22s)]
*  Like people are wondering what to do. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2043.1399999999999s)]
*  Like the town halls, this guy, Rick McCormick, who's a Republican House [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2045.18s)]
*  member in Georgia, deep red district. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2050.26s)]
*  I think it was like Trump won it by 20 points, 18, 20 points. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2052.6600000000003s)]
*  People were just like filled the town hall yelling at him. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2056.2200000000003s)]
*  And this is in like a very, very Republican district. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2059.6600000000003s)]
*  And then after and then the video went viral. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2062.1s)]
*  Everyone's talking about it. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2064.38s)]
*  And then today, apparently he was like, you know, I think some of this doge stuff, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2065.1400000000003s)]
*  they need to slow it down a little bit. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2070.54s)]
*  Lisa Murkowski responded to Elon Musk's email about Tell me what you did last [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2072.9s)]
*  week with like this is this is outrageous. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2078.0600000000004s)]
*  She was she's got really mad about she spoke out probably more forcefully than [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2080.42s)]
*  any other Senate Republican. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2083.82s)]
*  There is another Republican in Ohio, Troy Balderson. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2086.2200000000003s)]
*  He has an R plus 18 district. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2089.38s)]
*  He was like, yeah, I think we need to be careful with the cuts. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2091.54s)]
*  So I do think that like showing up at at Republican House members, especially [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2094.46s)]
*  Republican House members in some of these more competitive districts. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2099.5s)]
*  Bernie Sanders was on a tour this week. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2102.62s)]
*  He was in Iowa and Nebraska. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2104.58s)]
*  Part of the reason he picked those two spots was he picked two districts where [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2106.3s)]
*  there are Republicans sitting in districts where it's very competitive in 2026. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2109.54s)]
*  So I think putting real pressure on these frontline Republicans in the House and [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2115.1s)]
*  in the Senate is going to be really important and it actually can work. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2120.18s)]
*  Trump's goons are also aiming to make even bigger cuts to health care and other [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2124.82s)]
*  services people count on by passing actual legislation. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2127.9s)]
*  I'm going to talk to notices, Daniel Diaz about all that in just a minute. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2130.9s)]
*  But one last thing I wanted to hit a week ago, the Department of Homeland Security [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2134.34s)]
*  released two new taxpayer funded ads featuring Secretary Christine Ohm delivering [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2138.26s)]
*  a message to undocumented immigrants that started with this powerful and [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2143.38s)]
*  important tribute. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2148.1400000000003s)]
*  I'm Christine Ohm, the United States Secretary of Homeland Security. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2149.42s)]
*  Thank you, President Donald J. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2153.26s)]
*  Trump, for securing our border, for deporting criminal illegal immigrants and for [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2155.1s)]
*  putting America first. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2159.3399999999997s)]
*  For too long, weak politicians left our borders wide open. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2161.06s)]
*  They flooded our communities with drugs, human trafficking and violent criminals. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2164.5s)]
*  They put American lives at risk. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2169.02s)]
*  Well, those days are over. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2171.54s)]
*  Guess how much we all paid for that? [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2173.42s)]
*  Two hundred million dollars. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2175.02s)]
*  That's that's on the taxpayer dime talking about weak politicians. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2177.9s)]
*  Just a just a pure political ad. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2182.42s)]
*  Yeah. Indistinguishable from a campaign ad. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2184.66s)]
*  They were running it on Fox. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2186.8599999999997s)]
*  Like, oh, is that where is that where all the undocumented immigrants in the country [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2188.5s)]
*  and the ones who are thinking about coming here, they tuning in to Fox for [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2191.54s)]
*  Christine Ohm ad. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2194.7799999999997s)]
*  We know who's watching Fox. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2195.62s)]

*  It's it's it's for him. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2199.74s)]
*  And I think it's for their base to be like, look, we, you know, promises, promises [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2201.22s)]
*  made, promises kept. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2206.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, it's just like we're so, you know, that's a that adds a crime. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2207.18s)]

*  It's a it's a political ad to misuse of government funds. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2212.14s)]
*  Remember that? Yeah. The Hatch Act. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2215.14s)]
*  There's a whole whole bunch of ways in which I'm sure if we had a DOJ that was [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2216.22s)]
*  going to be run by other people, might have been something to look into. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2219.74s)]
*  But oh, well, you don't think Dan Bongina is going to be all over that. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2223.62s)]

*  Here's the idea. All right. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2270.82s)]
*  You're presented with two boxes. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2272.0600000000004s)]
*  All right. One has a thousand dollars in it. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2273.5800000000004s)]
*  The other is either empty or has a million dollars. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2275.98s)]
*  OK, OK. You have a choice. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2280.1400000000003s)]
*  You can take just box B. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2282.7000000000003s)]
*  That's either empty or has to a million dollars or you can take both boxes. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2285.1000000000004s)]
*  However, weeks ago, a supercomputer that knows everything is this. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2288.7400000000002s)]
*  I thought we were so close to the super computer that knows everything. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2292.9s)]
*  Predicted which box you would choose if you choose both boxes. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2296.0600000000004s)]
*  If it predicted you'd choose both boxes, the million dollar box is empty. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2299.7400000000002s)]
*  The second box is empty. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2303.1400000000003s)]
*  But if you just pick the one that's supposed to have a million dollars [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2304.1800000000003s)]

*  Joining us today from the capital, our friend Daniela Diaz, now at notice. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2655.06s)]
*  How are you? [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2660.7000000000003s)]
*  I'm great. I'm talking to you from this very [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2661.7000000000003s)]
*  unattractive closet right by the House chamber on the house side of the capital, [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2665.1s)]
*  the main capital building, so I couldn't be better. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2670.06s)]
*  It's an honor to be here talking to you. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2673.82s)]
*  It is wonderful to have you back. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2676.1s)]
*  So the big question this week is, can Mike Johnson get all the Republican votes he [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2678.5s)]
*  needs to pass the four trillion dollar budget resolution that's essentially [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2683.2200000000003s)]
*  the blueprint for Trump's entire legislative agenda, which is massive spending cuts and tax cuts? [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2688.1s)]
*  What are you hearing? [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2694.5s)]
*  As of now, he does not have the votes. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2695.6600000000003s)]
*  I'm talking to you, of course, Monday [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2698.26s)]
*  afternoon on Eastern Time on Capitol Hill, the House has not voted yet. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2699.98s)]
*  They will vote in just a few hours for the first time this week. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2705.0600000000004s)]
*  They were back in their home districts, House lawmakers last week. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2708.6200000000003s)]
*  So this will be the first time we see [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2712.82s)]
*  them in person where we'll be able to really ask them a lot of questions. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2714.38s)]
*  And by we, I mean reporters like myself who pepper lawmakers with questions [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2717.9s)]
*  for our jobs. That's that's what I do on a daily basis. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2723.22s)]
*  But as of now, he has a handful of people on both sides, very conservative House [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2725.86s)]
*  Republicans who want more spending and moderate Republicans who don't want to see [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2732.66s)]
*  cuts to Medicaid, SNAP, social benefits that their constituents really rely on [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2738.06s)]
*  that have not been guaranteed won't happen in this budget resolution. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2743.18s)]
*  So a lot of dynamics at play right now. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2746.82s)]
*  And Speaker Mike Johnson has been trying to really weave all the personalities [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2749.74s)]
*  together to see if he can pass this budget resolution. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2756.18s)]
*  It does seem like Groundhog Day, though. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2758.9399999999996s)]
*  I feel like every time I talk about what's happening on Capitol Hill, it's that [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2760.8999999999996s)]
*  Speaker Mike Johnson is facing his first real test of his leadership. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2764.8599999999997s)]
*  And I would argue this might be his first real test of his leadership. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2769.22s)]
*  But right now it remains to be seen whether he will be able to pass that budget [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2773.2999999999997s)]
*  resolution Tuesday evening. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2777.18s)]
*  Yeah, I'm wondering on this one who which group he has the bigger problems with right [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2779.22s)]
*  now, is it House members who are in competitive districts, [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2785.74s)]
*  maybe more moderate, worried about cuts to Medicaid? [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2791.9s)]
*  How many of them are there that he might have problems with? [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2795.58s)]
*  And then how many of the hardliners [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2798.54s)]
*  in the Freedom Caucus does he have problems with the Chip Roys and all those folks? [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2801.94s)]
*  Someone like Congresswoman Victoria Sparks, another very conservative member [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2806.5s)]
*  of the conference, is saying that it doesn't go far enough. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2811.5s)]
*  Of course, Thomas Massey, another staunch [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2814.78s)]
*  conservative, is also against this measure. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2816.7400000000002s)]
*  But another group that we're keeping an eye on that I've been talking to closely [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2819.2200000000003s)]
*  is the Congressional Hispanic Conference. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2823.9s)]
*  Think of a very small group of Latino lawmakers on Capitol Hill who are [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2826.06s)]
*  Republicans who have their own group, not the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2830.3s)]
*  could be confused. They're the Democratic group and very influential in that and [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2834.98s)]
*  that side of the Capitol, but they really want assurances from Speaker Mike Johnson [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2838.7400000000002s)]
*  that he is not going to cut Medicaid, snap these social benefits that are incredibly [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2844.7400000000002s)]
*  important to their constituents. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2851.82s)]
*  And they're planning to meet with Speaker Mike Johnson, have been having [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2853.1400000000003s)]
*  conversations with him to get those assurances, to get them to vote for this [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2856.42s)]
*  budget resolution. But they're the big group that we have to watch because there's [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2860.86s)]
*  enough of them that could tank this. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2864.3s)]
*  John, remember, this is a slim majority for Republicans in the House. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2865.86s)]
*  He can only really afford to lose, and by he, I mean Speaker Mike Johnson can only [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2869.78s)]
*  really afford to lose one to two votes depending on absences, [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2873.86s)]
*  depending on which Democrats show up to vote for this budget resolution as well [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2878.94s)]
*  because of that slim majority. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2882.46s)]
*  So he's really got a tricky situation on his hands. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2883.78s)]
*  Yeah, he does. He has a tricky situation in terms of getting the votes. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2886.9s)]
*  He also has a really tricky situation in [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2891.34s)]
*  terms of getting the math to work for all of this. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2893.14s)]
*  Like, I don't know. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2895.54s)]
*  It seems like he's either going to go ahead and the Republicans are all going to [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2897.22s)]
*  hold hands and jump and pass a resolution or and then maybe a final bill that [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2902.14s)]
*  actually does cut Medicaid by quite a bit, way past just adding work [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2908.42s)]
*  requirements, by the way, right? [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2913.5s)]
*  It's like eight hundred and eighty billion dollars, which is quite a huge cut. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2915.1s)]
*  Is there a version of this where they just decide they're too nervous about the [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2918.34s)]
*  cuts because there's too many front line members worried about Medicaid cuts and [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2922.74s)]
*  they end up just passing it like last time in 20 in the first Trump administration. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2927.02s)]
*  They just end up passing a huge tax cut [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2931.8199999999997s)]
*  that adds to the deficit and they really don't get into all the cuts. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2933.7799999999997s)]
*  Like, I just don't know how the math works out on all of this. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2937.3399999999997s)]
*  You're asking very valid questions. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2940.22s)]
*  I'm by no means a mathematician, so I'm also asking these types of questions [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2942.4599999999996s)]
*  when I'm talking to lawmakers in charge of these decisions. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2946.74s)]
*  But something to remind you, John, anyone [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2949.7799999999997s)]
*  listening to this is that the Senate has been moving forward with their own plan. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2952.62s)]
*  They are completely disregarding what Trump endorsed last week. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2956.94s)]
*  The one big, beautiful bill, as we've been seeing that phrase, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2960.94s)]
*  floated over and over again, that massive agenda that would this budget resolution, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2964.38s)]
*  which includes, of course, extending the 2017 tax cuts that Trump enacted in his [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2968.9s)]
*  first administration, border security and cuts to the national deficit and raising [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2973.22s)]
*  the debt ceiling, Republicans, Senate Republicans have said, [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2978.7799999999997s)]
*  we're doing our own thing. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2981.8199999999997s)]
*  We have a plan B and we're moving forward with it. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2983.06s)]
*  They started last week. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2985.8199999999997s)]
*  And that's what we call a slimmer budget [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2986.9399999999996s)]
*  resolution that does not include tax cuts, but does include defense spending, [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2989.8199999999997s)]
*  energy spending, border provisions in a way to try to have Republican wins [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=2994.8199999999997s)]
*  because they don't think and this is, of course, not my thoughts. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3000.9399999999996s)]
*  What I'm hearing from Senate Republicans [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3004.58s)]
*  that the House Republicans can get their work together, let's put it that way, [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3006.38s)]
*  that they can move forward on their own bill that includes everything, [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3011.82s)]
*  encompasses all of Trump's massive agenda. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3016.6200000000003s)]
*  So Senate Republicans are moving forward with this. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3018.6600000000003s)]
*  They still haven't passed it. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3021.06s)]
*  They had their Voterama last week with all their budget resolutions. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3022.38s)]
*  But now they have to start the work of this bill. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3027.42s)]
*  That's what I mean when I say that. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3029.86s)]
*  Another thing to keep in mind for anyone listening, this is just the first [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3032.06s)]
*  step of this of this whole process of a budget reconciliation bill on Capitol Hill. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3036.06s)]
*  They need to still pass the final version of this bill that hasn't even been written. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3042.2599999999998s)]
*  So that's actually an argument that Speaker Mike Johnson is using with his rank [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3047.9s)]
*  and file members. This is just the beginning. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3052.46s)]
*  Work with me on this. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3054.7s)]
*  Let's pass this first step so we can start the real work on trying to write this bill. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3055.9s)]
*  Senate Republicans, of course, moving forward [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3060.06s)]
*  with their own version that doesn't include taxics. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3062.38s)]
*  So the people know it could look very, very different. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3064.94s)]
*  The final bill from whatever passes, whatever budget resolution passes. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3068.7000000000003s)]
*  And, you know, I think the Democrats did this with Build Back Better, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3073.86s)]
*  which is you can get all the Republicans potentially to vote for it by saying, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3078.1400000000003s)]
*  maybe you don't like some of the numbers in there now, but you know what? [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3082.34s)]
*  We can change it later. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3086.02s)]
*  Let's just keep the process moving forward. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3087.34s)]
*  Yeah. And this process isn't something that happens in a week, maybe even in a month. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3089.26s)]
*  I mean, Speaker Mike Johnson was at an event earlier today talking to a group [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3094.18s)]
*  of conservatives saying, my hope is to get this passed by the first week of April, [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3098.94s)]
*  the final version of this bill. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3104.06s)]
*  Now, all of us that were listening to him to that interview thought that's really [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3105.66s)]
*  optimistic. This is going to be a major upheld climb for him and for Senate [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3109.86s)]
*  Republicans, too, because that is a matter of uniting every single [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3114.7s)]
*  Republican to get behind this bill to pass it. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3120.06s)]
*  They don't need Democratic votes. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3123.02s)]
*  As you mentioned, they did this with lots of bills in the Biden administration, [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3124.38s)]
*  you know, Inflation Rejection Act. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3128.82s)]
*  These bills don't need, in that case, needed Republican votes. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3130.54s)]
*  In this case, they don't Democratic votes, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3133.9s)]
*  but it does mean they need every single Republican for the most part to support it. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3135.42s)]
*  And we all know there's a lot of personalities in both sides of the Senate [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3139.1800000000003s)]
*  and the House Republican conferences. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3143.9s)]
*  What are you hearing from both House and Senate Republicans in terms of how anxious [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3145.94s)]
*  they are over the size of these cuts, particularly the Medicaid cuts? [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3152.82s)]
*  Do you think that is something that they could eventually live with? [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3156.86s)]
*  Or are there some people who are like, no, I'm not going to vote for huge cuts? [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3161.1000000000004s)]
*  This is a major red line for a lot of vulnerable Republicans facing tough [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3165.34s)]
*  reelection campaigns in blue districts and battleground districts. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3170.3s)]
*  I mean, remember, not every Republican [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3174.6200000000003s)]
*  serving in Congress came from a district that is completely red. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3176.7000000000003s)]
*  They have to speak to their constituents, [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3180.3s)]
*  especially these Republicans that I mentioned in the Congressional Hispanic [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3181.94s)]
*  Conference. Not all of them are from swing districts, to be clear, [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3185.82s)]
*  but a lot of them represent constituents who rely on these social benefits to get [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3188.3s)]
*  by day to day and who are talking to these members saying, I won't vote for you [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3193.78s)]
*  this next election unless you can guarantee that these won't get cut. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3197.94s)]
*  Those members, of course, being led by [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3200.98s)]
*  Congressman Tony Gonzalez, a Republican who, of course, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3203.5s)]
*  came from a Trump district in Texas, but represents this this group of Republicans [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3206.7000000000003s)]
*  who might be facing tough reelection, who want guarantees from leadership [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3211.14s)]
*  that they won't touch these very crucial programs that their constituents need. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3215.3799999999997s)]
*  If Johnson can guarantee that that's the case, that they won't get cut, [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3220.3399999999997s)]
*  they won't even be touched, which is what these Republicans want promises on, [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3225.18s)]
*  there's a likelihood that they would support this massive budget resolution [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3229.58s)]
*  and passing this massive bill that would, of course, enact Trump's massive agenda. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3233.9s)]
*  But it depends on whether they can get [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3237.7799999999997s)]
*  those assurances and they haven't gotten them yet. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3239.74s)]
*  So the government also runs out of money in a few weeks. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3242.3799999999997s)]
*  Do you think Republicans can pass a continuing resolution that keeps [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3245.62s)]
*  the government open by funding it at current spending levels, which is just [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3250.18s)]
*  kicking the can down the road again, because otherwise they need [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3254.5s)]
*  Democratic votes, we can talk about that in a second. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3257.8599999999997s)]
*  But what do you think the prospects are [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3259.8999999999996s)]
*  of Republicans being able to keep the government open on their own? [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3261.66s)]
*  I think it's very unlikely, John, because if you know, you and I know this [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3264.7s)]
*  because we love Congress, but I assume you love Congress. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3268.82s)]
*  I love Congress. I love covering. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3271.6200000000003s)]
*  I love I worked there once upon a time. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3273.34s)]
*  There is a handful of House Republicans who have never voted for a CR [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3275.5400000000004s)]
*  and it's always passed with Democratic votes. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3279.6200000000003s)]
*  Now, Democrats won't obviously support a CR based on all the I've covered so many [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3282.42s)]
*  CR, so I'm coming at this from ground like it's almost like a trauma for me [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3288.38s)]
*  at this point to cover another CR being passed on Capitol Hill. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3293.5400000000004s)]
*  But they won't support a CR unless they can get something out of the whatever [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3297.54s)]
*  bill is passed, any more additional measures that will benefit Democrats. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3302.98s)]
*  They're not going to support something that's Republican led. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3307.54s)]
*  So Republicans are already starting to paint this as if Democrats aren't going [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3309.86s)]
*  to support us on this issue, then they're the ones that caused a shutdown. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3314.42s)]
*  Meanwhile, there's always a handful of [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3318.3s)]
*  Republicans who don't vote for continuing resolutions, which I should note is funding [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3319.7000000000003s)]
*  the government at its current levels for a certain amount of time. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3323.5s)]
*  So [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3326.5800000000004s)]
*  I don't bet anything when it comes to Congress because I've been surprised in [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3328.34s)]
*  the many years that I've been covering this building, you know, they do sometimes [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3332.42s)]
*  come through and by they, I mean both both sides, both chambers with solutions. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3337.26s)]
*  Like, for example, what happened in December when very last minute after Elon Musk [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3341.5800000000004s)]
*  tanked in a tweet and a post on X, the current CR situation one week ahead [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3345.42s)]
*  of the holidays and then Republicans had to scatter around and really get [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3351.8599999999997s)]
*  push forward a CR that they could get behind, that the majority of the Congress [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3358.06s)]
*  could get behind, that Democrats could get behind. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3361.5s)]
*  It happened. They prevented a shutdown very last minute. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3363.38s)]
*  I did not see that coming. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3366.14s)]
*  So it could be another situation like that in just two weeks, however long it is [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3367.66s)]
*  till March 14th and government funding runs out. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3372.3399999999997s)]
*  But as of now, Republicans are Republican [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3374.9s)]
*  appropriators who are in charge of funding levels, are blaming Democrats for [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3378.22s)]
*  bad faith negotiations, Democrats appropriators are blaming Republicans for [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3382.98s)]
*  bad faith negotiations, they are at a standstill on these negotiations for [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3388.14s)]
*  government funding in order to keep the government open. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3391.98s)]
*  At this point, it's probably going to be a CR. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3394.8599999999997s)]
*  Democrats are not going to support that [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3398.2599999999998s)]
*  without any sort of additional measures attached to it that they can get behind. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3399.9399999999996s)]
*  So this is going to get messy. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3404.18s)]
*  Do you think that Hakeem Jeffries has his whole caucus unified in not giving [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3405.58s)]
*  Republicans vote for this, votes for this, or do you see, are you hearing anything [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3413.1s)]
*  from the more conservative House Democrats or the House Democrats in front [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3418.06s)]
*  line districts or the Problem Solvers Caucus or any of those characters? [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3422.58s)]
*  Like, do you think that the Democrats are seem unified on this so far? [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3425.5s)]
*  Well, if there's something I can tell, I [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3429.34s)]
*  can say about a minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, is he does a really good job [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3431.18s)]
*  based on the numerous CRs I've covered of keeping his caucus united when it comes [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3435.8199999999997s)]
*  to votes that matter. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3442.14s)]
*  And while there might be sometimes one or two Democrats that are against [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3445.5s)]
*  the overall caucus goal of tanking a vote, passing a vote, [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3449.62s)]
*  he's in a good job of keeping them in line. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3453.62s)]
*  And as of now, a lot of rank and file [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3455.7s)]
*  Democrats are going to take his lead on how he handles this issue. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3458.86s)]
*  But if you ask Hakeem Jeffries, leader Hakeem Jeffries about this, [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3462.7000000000003s)]
*  he'll say it's too soon and he wants to see what appropriators come up with [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3466.38s)]
*  as they tend to have these bills written and on the floor the week of a government [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3470.6600000000003s)]
*  shutdown pending. So he wants to leave [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3478.46s)]
*  appropriators to figure out how they're going to handle this. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3480.6600000000003s)]
*  When that timeline comes to an end and it's now crunch time to try to fund [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3483.7400000000002s)]
*  the government, that's when we see him come forward or behind closed doors, [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3488.62s)]
*  talk to his caucus and say, you got to stay behind me. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3492.1s)]
*  You have to vote against this bill. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3495.02s)]
*  We want to see what happens. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3496.8599999999997s)]
*  As you noted, there are always more vulnerable House Democrats, [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3498.46s)]
*  Blue Dogs, Democrats from red districts who have a lot of pressure to vote [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3502.74s)]
*  with Republicans and keep the government open or at least help listen to their [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3508.8599999999997s)]
*  constituents to side with Republicans. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3513.3399999999997s)]
*  It seems like Jeffries does a really good job of listening to them as well. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3515.74s)]
*  And, you know, in that case, I'm sure we'll know closer to then what kind of [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3518.7s)]
*  message he'll give them, whether it's to quote something we hear along the lines [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3522.66s)]
*  of very often here, vote your conscience. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3527.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3529.94s)]
*  Republicans holding town halls last week [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3531.7s)]
*  were flooded with constituents angry about Elon's Doge antics, among other things. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3533.9s)]
*  I saw I saw your former colleague, [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3539.62s)]
*  Rachel Bade, write that Republicans aren't at all nervous about these town halls, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3541.62s)]
*  at least on the Doge stuff, maybe a little bit more on the Medicaid side. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3546.7799999999997s)]
*  Is that your sense as well? [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3551.3s)]
*  Yes, Doge largely, even just a couple of hours ago, has been praised by Republican [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3553.02s)]
*  leaders, Speaker Mike Johnson speaking very highly of Elon Musk and his efforts to [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3559.9s)]
*  cut down government spending, cut government jobs. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3564.82s)]
*  Now our rank and file Republicans hearing [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3568.94s)]
*  from their constituents like Rich McCormick, who has been out. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3571.86s)]
*  I've seen a lot of videos. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3575.42s)]
*  I'm sure you have two of his town hall over [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3576.6600000000003s)]
*  the weekend going viral because he heard from a lot of angry constituents in Georgia [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3578.9s)]
*  about Doge. He's actually coming out and saying, I actually think the White House [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3583.0600000000004s)]
*  needs to go about this a little more slowly. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3587.1800000000003s)]
*  He told a Republican excuse me, a Georgia podcast that just an hour ago that he [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3589.26s)]
*  believes that they need to take a look at what Elon Musk is doing without [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3595.94s)]
*  blanket support of his measures and his actions in cutting government spending. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3601.5s)]
*  So we're hearing from him in that sense. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3606.3s)]
*  But the majority of Republicans from who I've talked to in the last [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3608.86s)]
*  how many weeks has Elon Musk been doing this now since he took office or it's [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3613.1800000000003s)]
*  sorry, not took office, took over Doge, I should say. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3618.1000000000004s)]
*  They're really largely supportive of his [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3622.82s)]
*  work and they support his efforts to cut government spending. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3625.78s)]
*  They think it might help with trying to pass this massive [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3629.54s)]
*  proposal that would enact Trump's agenda items. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3634.78s)]
*  And they think continuing to cut government spending is really what their goal is as [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3638.02s)]
*  they have this Republican trifecta and they're committing to what their [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3642.46s)]
*  constituents wanted. But you are hearing, to be clear, John, from a couple of [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3646.1s)]
*  Republicans, I mentioned Rich McCormick, Lisa Murkowski, Senator from Alaska, who [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3650.58s)]
*  is coming forward and saying she's not supportive of what Elon Musk is doing. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3655.5s)]
*  And she is very concerned that his cuts will affect conservation efforts in Alaska, [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3658.54s)]
*  energy projects in Alaska. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3663.38s)]
*  So there are a couple of senators, House members, Republicans, namely [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3665.1s)]
*  Democrats, of course, are very against what Elon Musk is doing that are coming out [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3669.7s)]
*  and saying specifically how these efforts could affect them back home. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3673.5s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like they're all in favor [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3676.94s)]
*  of cutting government and making government more efficient and even getting rid of [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3679.02s)]
*  some of the federal workforce in principle. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3683.54s)]
*  It does sound like the ones who are facing town halls and facing angry [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3685.34s)]
*  constituents and angry constituents or the ones who have constituents who are [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3690.58s)]
*  affected by these cuts are starting to get maybe a little wobbly. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3694.82s)]
*  Is that fair? [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3698.1000000000004s)]
*  That's fair. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3699.02s)]
*  And, you know, something to keep in mind is [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3699.98s)]
*  something we're hearing from Democrats. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3704.78s)]
*  An argument is that they didn't vote for Elon Musk. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3706.54s)]
*  And that's something that we're hearing these [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3709.5s)]
*  constituents in these town halls also tell these Republicans. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3711.7s)]
*  But I do want to note that in-person town halls have also become really rare these [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3715.5s)]
*  days, most Republicans and Democrats, I should note as well, do tell a town halls, [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3721.02s)]
*  virtual town halls. So seeing these in-person town halls is really unique and [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3726.1s)]
*  show that from these members that they do want to hear from their constituents are [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3731.06s)]
*  willing to put up, you know, with the criticism that they're receiving. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3735.18s)]
*  So seeing Rich McCormick deal with that, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3738.54s)]
*  really interesting because most members don't really like to do that anymore. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3741.06s)]
*  Last question, I'll let you go. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3744.34s)]
*  I just was wondering as a reporter, [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3746.38s)]
*  you've been watching the last month unfold. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3749.82s)]
*  The Trump White House has booted the Associated Press out of the White House [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3752.5s)]
*  for not calling it the Gulf of America. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3758.02s)]
*  Just today, we're talking Monday afternoon. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3761.46s)]
*  Trump did a joint press conference with [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3764.6600000000003s)]
*  Macron and the AP reporter based in France was allowed to ask a question [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3766.98s)]
*  because the French decided that would be their first question. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3773.98s)]
*  So that was the decision by the French. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3776.46s)]
*  The AP reporter based in the US that's supposed to cover the White House was not [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3778.54s)]
*  allowed in again. Trump also posted this morning about how [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3782.5s)]
*  MSNBC is illegal and should be shut down and should have to pay a lot of money. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3788.3s)]
*  For I don't know what. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3794.5s)]
*  Has there been like discussions between [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3797.06s)]
*  outlets like yours and other outlets about like how to handle this as a sort [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3800.1800000000003s)]
*  of as an institution? How are you dealing with it? [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3804.94s)]
*  How is Notice dealing with it? [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3807.9s)]
*  What are your thoughts on all this? [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3809.7400000000002s)]
*  John, I can't speak to what Notice is doing or my former employer, [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3811.54s)]
*  Politico is doing or even my former employer, CNN is doing. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3815.42s)]
*  I've worked in a lot of news outlets in DC. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3818.1800000000003s)]
*  But something that I know and that I truly [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3820.6200000000003s)]
*  feel is that I'm supportive of freedom of the press. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3823.02s)]
*  And I think it's incredibly important for all reporters to have access to [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3825.3s)]
*  newsmakers, be able to be allowed in those rooms to be able to ask those questions. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3829.94s)]
*  And I stand by making sure that, you know, [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3834.38s)]
*  with the institutions that have been in these rooms and have always been [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3837.1s)]
*  in these rooms should be in these rooms. Yes, that's very well said. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3840.14s)]
*  Danielle Diaz, thank you so much, as always, for joining us on Pads of America. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3844.54s)]
*  And congrats on your new gig at Notice and keep in touch. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3848.3s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3853.5s)]
*  That's our show for today. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3855.1800000000003s)]
*  Dan and I will be back with a new show on Friday. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3856.1000000000004s)]
*  Talk to you then. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3858.1400000000003s)]
*  Great thing about going to lowly is you're guaranteed not to see Bill Maher. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3859.1800000000003s)]
*  Maybe maybe for now. I want to get him. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMpiLzY3xqE&t=3863.46s)]
