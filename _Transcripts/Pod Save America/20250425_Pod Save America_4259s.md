Video Description: As Tesla's losses mount, Elon Musk promises to step away from his work at DOGE and focus on his flailing car company. Trump and his top advisers flip-flop on China tariffs, even as Trump steers more cash into his own pocket by raffling off White House access to the top investors in his memecoin. Exclusive new polling shows Trump's weaknesses on immigration, even as the administration continues its crackdown and the courts push back. Jon and Dan discuss if Elon is gone for good or merely taking a sabbatical, whether DOGE will hold any sway without him, and how a high-profile exit from CBS's 60 Minutes is a troubling sign for media everywhere. Then, Jon and Dan sit down with Amanda Litman, the co-founder of Run For Something, to talk about her new book for Crooked Media Reads, When We’re in Charge, a brilliant guide for young people looking to get into leadership positions.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Flailing Donald Trump Is Badly Screwing Up His Trade War With China, Desperately Looking For an Out
**Pod Save America:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk)
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm John Favreau. I'm Dan Pfeiffer. Here we are in DC back home [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, Dan's Dan's delivering the the big speech at the correspondent center and you're you're the comedian, right? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4.8s)]
*  And you're here for a bill signing in the Oval Office, right? I'm here. Yes. I'm here for the EO [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=11.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's really exciting. No, we're just in in town for the for a couple days to catch up with some people and I [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Don't know. What do you think of DC since we have I haven't been here in a year seems more ominous [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=22.64s)]
*  But maybe that's just my own I think that's that's in your head [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=27.0s)]
*  It is in my you could walk around and not know the democracy is collapsing around you like the Lincoln Memorial still standing [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=28.92s)]
*  For now for now. We haven't left yet [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=34.8s)]
*  Alright on today's show. We're gonna talk about [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=37.32s)]
*  Elon Musk who is leaving the White House to spend more time with his ailing car company [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=39.8s)]
*  We'll talk about what it means for his quest to break all the government services Americans rely on [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=45.16s)]
*  We'll also talk about Donald Trump's quest to make America poorer with his big dumb trade war and his quest to make himself richer with a [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  New crypto scheme to literally sell dinners with Trump and White House tours to people who buy his meme coin [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=55.32s)]
*  Shocking, but not really [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  We've also got our hands on some exclusive new polling that lines up with a lot of other recent polls that show just how unpopular [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=64.16s)]
*  Trump's illegal deportations are with the public and then our good friend Amanda Lippman a co-founder of run for something comes by to talk [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=69.64s)]
*  About her new book for crooked media reads when we're in charge, which is a fantastic guide for young people looking to get into leadership positions [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=76.44s)]
*  but first [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=84.64s)]
*  Talk about the art of the deal, which hopefully all of you have read by now. It's required reading in America. It's required reading [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=86.16s)]
*  Here's how it works [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  You win an election based largely on the perception that you'll lower prices and keep the economy growing [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=93.0s)]
*  Upon taking office you start a massive trade war with the entire world that panics the markets sends investors fleeing from the United States and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=98.91999999999999s)]
*  threatens to plunge the economy into recession then [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=107.16s)]
*  You pause some of the tariffs raise them on China [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=110.48s)]
*  Promise to make a bunch of deals make no deals and for good measure threaten to fire the Fed chair who you appointed [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=113.84s)]
*  If any of that sounds confusing [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=121.08s)]
*  Here's a sampling of what it was like to follow the Trump administration statements on the economy just this week [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  I'm how you said that the termination of wrong how cannot come fast enough [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=128.64s)]
*  He says he won't leave it even if you ask him to oh, he'll leave if I ask him to he'll be out of there [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=133.2s)]
*  No, I have no intention to fire according to this source in the room [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=138.72s)]
*  What the Treasury Secretary said was no one thinks the current status quo is sustainable at 145 and 125 percent [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=141.88s)]
*  In terms of the relationship with tariffs with China. Let me be clear [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=149.39999999999998s)]
*  There will be no unilateral reduction in tariffs against China [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=153.72s)]
*  The president has made it clear China needs to make a deal with the United States of America [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=157.52s)]
*  I'm not gonna say I'm gonna play hardball with China. I'm gonna play hardball with you president. She no no [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=161.36s)]
*  We're gonna be very nice. They're gonna be very nice. You got all that Dan [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=167.16s)]
*  One last kicker from this morning a top Chinese official said there had been no talks [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=172.28s)]
*  And that the US must cancel all of its tariffs if it wants to deal [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=176.4s)]
*  He quoted a Chinese proverb the person who tied the bell must untie it nice [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=180.42s)]
*  Do you think Trump's gonna untie the bell and what do you make of all the back and forth? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=185.73999999999998s)]
*  I think they Trump was asked again right before we were recording [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=190.26s)]
*  About the Chinese official who made those comments and he was like, well, there was a meeting this morning [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=194.22s)]
*  And then maybe I'll reveal who it was at some point, but there's a meeting [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=198.98s)]
*  So I think it's the it's fake news the fake news the story about the fake news the fake news [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=201.45999999999998s)]
*  Got it. I have some questions about the Chinese proverb. Yeah, how do you tie a bell? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=205.29999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, you can't well [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=209.82s)]
*  I thought it was gonna be the person who brings the bells and ring though [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=211.57999999999998s)]
*  But you can't write unring a bell which is the whole point of the original [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  Right, I think they got to work on that. I think we should jack up the tariffs a little more just for that [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=216.66s)]
*  It's also possible things have gotten lost in translation here. I [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=220.94s)]
*  Mean this is insanity. Yeah, but it's also should be completely expected. Like this is what happens when you [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=224.54s)]
*  put in the White House a [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=230.54s)]
*  erratic older man [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=232.78s)]
*  Who hasn't had a new idea since Cheers was on the air and then he surrounds himself with a bunch of yahoos who view their only [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=234.46s)]
*  Job is to make the Mad King happy. Yeah, and so you end up with this [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=242.22s)]
*  pure [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=247.70000000000002s)]
*  chaos and [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=248.98000000000002s)]
*  It is like there is no [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=250.70000000000002s)]
*  There is no coherent policy. There is no coherent ideology behind the policy [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=253.06s)]
*  There is no consistency between on a minute to minute basis [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=257.86s)]
*  We're recording this on Thursday afternoon East Coast time by the time people listen to this on Friday morning [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=262.18s)]
*  It's very possible and perhaps probable that there will be an entirely new position on tariffs with China by the time you listen to this [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=265.86s)]
*  It's a good bet. I mean there's always been this axiom that the only real constraint on Trump [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=272.5s)]
*  Is that he won't do anything that tanks the markets but from? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=278.3s)]
*  Liberation day onward at least that hasn't been true [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=282.58s)]
*  What do we know if anything about? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=286.58s)]
*  Why he may ultimately back down? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=289.3s)]
*  He is responding to the markets right and he has been since the beginning here when the he put the first tariffs on [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=292.14s)]
*  Canada Mexico market tanked he took them off [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=298.5s)]
*  Then he put new tariffs on Canada Mexico market tank they announced a bunch of exceptions that basically made them hollow shells himself [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=300.86s)]
*  Then he puts a global terror. They does the reciprocal tariffs on everyone [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=306.97999999999996s)]
*  Market tanks takes those off moves it down to 10% but keeps them on China market tanks [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=311.09999999999997s)]
*  Takes them off or at least talks about taking them off to make the market go up [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=316.97999999999996s)]
*  Talks about firing drone pal market tanks [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=321.32s)]
*  Take says he's not gonna fire his own pal market gains again. And so he is responding to it [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=324.36s)]
*  The problem is is he is does not I? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=329.24s)]
*  Mean it's gonna shock him. It doesn't get it [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=332.4s)]
*  He doesn't get that every time he takes the market and then changes his position [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=334.4s)]
*  He's making the next time he changes position less helpful like he the stock market will come back stock market always comes back [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=338.88s)]
*  But every time he's inserting more uncertainty into the economy [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=345.86s)]
*  Which is going to depress everything right? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=350.56s)]
*  We got reports this morning that new home sales are at their lowest level since [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=354.22s)]
*  2022 coming right out of the pandemic and this is all happening because [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=358.12s)]
*  No one not a major corporation not a small business that a family can make any decisions. They have no idea what's happening [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=362.52s)]
*  Are things that go about things that we all need? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=369.24s)]
*  About to be exponentially more expensive in a few weeks or not. We don't know [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=372.88s)]
*  Are we gonna be in a recession or not? We don't know is [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=377.67999999999995s)]
*  Jerome Powell gonna be in charge of monetary policy or will it be someone from Fox Business? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=382.28s)]
*  We don't know and because of that it is doing real damage to the economy [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=387.2s)]
*  That is it cannot simply be undone by another truth contradicting what Caroline Levitt said earlier that day [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=391.97999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, the first reaction from the White House when the start was like, oh who cares about the markets and that's just Wall Street [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=398.34s)]
*  We're focused on Main Street and what they missed about that aside from the fact that you know [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=404.36s)]
*  Most Americans have at least some money in the stock market most of their retirement that the the market is [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=409.40000000000003s)]
*  Just responding to how they believe the economy is going to fare and the economic damage is already begun [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=416.52000000000004s)]
*  and we haven't even seen the worst of it yet, even if the trade war stops tomorrow, by the way, some of this is priced in because [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=422.96000000000004s)]
*  But I do think that he met with this week [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=428.76s)]
*  The CEOs of Target and Walmart and Home Depot and [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=432.09999999999997s)]
*  They reportedly told him that we are a couple weeks away from empty shelves [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=436.26s)]
*  Not just higher prices [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=440.9s)]
*  They said that too, but empty shelves because there'll be such a supply chain issue [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=442.09999999999997s)]
*  Which is what we dealt with during the pandemic for reasons that weren't just some idiots trade war [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=445.97999999999996s)]
*  and [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=450.9s)]
*  IMF they had originally predicted the inflation rate the US was supposed to be 1.9 percent this year [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=452.3s)]
*  They've up that prediction to 3% there are truck plants in [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=457.62s)]
*  Maryland and Pennsylvania already laying off hundreds of workers because orders aren't coming in due to a lack of certainty [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=462.85999999999996s)]
*  Manufacturers are already reducing headcount. Remember this whole thing one of the one of the rationale is one of the many is that we're bringing [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=469.09999999999997s)]
*  Manufacturing back to the United States, but it's actually making things more expensive and manufacturing is going to leave the United States [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=475.06s)]
*  Or at least lay off workers. Yes, because they get the parts from other countries [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=480.58s)]
*  Yeah, I mean there's even it's like it's affecting small businesses like there is a small business that [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=484.58s)]
*  My wife uses to buy name tags for like the small name tags for like kids clothes and lunchboxes like that [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=489.26s)]
*  Yeah, they would not a business because the tariffs they send an email out to everyone saying [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=495.56s)]
*  That they couldn't afford it because the tariffs I assume they get the products from China. The other [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=498.74s)]
*  challenge I don't think they've really thought through is that [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=504.38s)]
*  Is you know doing a full trade war with the Chinese Chinese government? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=507.53999999999996s)]
*  They've been authoritarian government for a long time and so they can [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=514.02s)]
*  Basically force their people to accept much more pain [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=519.5400000000001s)]
*  Then maybe Americans are willing to accept and so they can I don't know that China is going to be I mean from that from that [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=523.14s)]
*  Wonderful proverb we heard I know that China's gonna be backing down anytime soon because Trump looks like an idiot [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=529.74s)]
*  try it like it's it's causing Trump political pain and [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=534.66s)]
*  I think they can like obviously China doesn't want to be in this trade war [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=538.7s)]
*  But I think that they can probably last longer than Trump thinks they can of course they absolutely can like this [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=542.1s)]
*  Like there's no political pressure like she's not waiting worrying about the you gov daily tracking poll and like how it's gonna impact the generic [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=546.58s)]
*  Ballot like that's not a concern if is so he doesn't have that problem [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=553.38s)]
*  But there's a world where a normal competent president with a coherent economic and foreign policy [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=556.02s)]
*  Would be marshaling the world to unite against China in this trade war. You would be working with [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=562.5400000000001s)]
*  the EU but also other [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=568.58s)]
*  Asian countries [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=571.54s)]
*  But instead Trump is piss off the entire world and now these countries are going to be in a position where they're going to be [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=572.98s)]
*  Incentivized to cut specific deals with China well and already there's reports that Japan is saying they don't want to be part of any deal [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=577.42s)]
*  That screws over China because that's a market for them China has reached out to the EU and has said let's let's form an alliance [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=585.02s)]
*  against the [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=592.78s)]
*  Justice we put it on the whiteboard [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=595.38s)]
*  I'm fucking real. Yeah, and again [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=597.9399999999999s)]
*  This is like like he could climb down from this whole thing tomorrow and pretend [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=600.26s)]
*  It's a big victory and say we have the we have they're talking about now [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=603.78s)]
*  They're weeks and weeks and maybe months away from actual deals [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=607.02s)]
*  But maybe there's a memorandum of understanding they can have with India about the contours of a deal [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=610.3s)]
*  So they're gonna like they could take something and say oh big victory Trump wins already economic damage [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=616.16s)]
*  And I think it's gonna be very hard to put this back in the box even if he stops tomorrow. Yeah [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=621.06s)]
*  We're also we're seeing a lot of new polling now on how Americans are looking at all this [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=627.06s)]
*  I think you guys talked about that this week on Polar Cruster. Yeah, I spoke with Molly Murphy [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=630.8599999999999s)]
*  Who is one of the smartest Democratic pollsters? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=636.14s)]
*  she [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=638.14s)]
*  Polled for the Harris campaign [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=638.9399999999999s)]
*  But also for was the slack in Josh Stein and a whole bunch of other candidates and we talked about the state of politics [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=640.3s)]
*  Public opinion about specific about the polling. We have a clip. We just did a poll [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=646.3s)]
*  We do polling with the Wall Street Journal and we looked at the tariff policies [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=650.78s)]
*  We looked at how people think it will affect the economy and their costs and a majority of Americans oppose the tariffs [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=654.68s)]
*  75% think it will cause their own costs to go up and as you said they voted for him to bring costs down [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=661.52s)]
*  The nuance here with Trump is that when he messages this he messages short-term gain [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=668.92s)]
*  It's odd that he gets away in some ways with being honest with people by saying short-term pain long-term gain [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=673.9399999999999s)]
*  We've got some big problems and so there's about a third of Americans who are sitting in this [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=679.62s)]
*  Maybe we're gonna take on some short-term pain if we see things get better [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=685.74s)]
*  It will be worth it [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=689.7800000000001s)]
*  But I think we all know that this isn't gonna result in lower costs for people [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=690.82s)]
*  It is not going to turn out that way and those will be the fissures and that's really the [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=694.82s)]
*  Imperative for Democrats to really take on and not let him get away with the messaging that he's currently putting out there [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=699.48s)]
*  Let me expand upon what Molly said there which is they had three groups of voters [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=704.7s)]
*  There's a groups who are all pain right and that's mostly Democrats. Yeah, I don't like Trump [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=708.06s)]
*  There is a group of people who are no pain. It's not gonna hurt a short term [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=713.5799999999999s)]
*  It's the head is not gonna lose long term, right? Enjoy enjoy. It's great tariffs are great and that's Trump space and the middle is [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=716.9s)]
*  some pain [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=723.9799999999999s)]
*  But some long-term gain these a lot of these folks are independents [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=725.3599999999999s)]
*  Some of them are soft Republicans [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=728.02s)]
*  But that's the group that Democrats are gonna have to focus on when the long the medium and long-term game does not happen [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=729.38s)]
*  Yeah short-term pain long-term decline long-term global economic collapse and look I think that people [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=735.82s)]
*  People may say let's give them some time weeks months [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=742.62s)]
*  It's understandable more almost a hundred days in if you're a Trump fan, right? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=746.26s)]
*  but I don't think people have the patience that they even tell pollsters they have because none of us have patience anymore most [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=749.5s)]
*  Because of our screens and media in the way the world's work [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=756.9000000000001s)]
*  So I don't think in like a couple of weeks if the shelves are empty at fucking target people are gonna be like [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=759.0400000000001s)]
*  Well, it's short-term pain. I just I know something better is right around the corner [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=765.36s)]
*  Well people are against the tariffs and they're suffering almost no consequences of them yet, right? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=768.64s)]
*  A lot of this is from a business. Yeah, you're dealing with this [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=772.74s)]
*  but like as a consumer you're not yet paying higher prices in most cases and [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=775.76s)]
*  The shelves are not yet empty when I face in supply chain room. So when that happens it is [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=781.24s)]
*  Truly stunning. It takes actual effort [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=786.24s)]
*  To both crash the economy and raise prices. Yeah, normally you raise prices as the economy is running too hot [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=789.88s)]
*  that's when inflation comes and so he's put us in a position where [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=796.04s)]
*  We're gonna be potentially in a recession and we're gonna have inflation. That is like really impressive stuff from the guy just and just [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=800.0s)]
*  completely [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=808.12s)]
*  1000% self-inflicted he could have just come into office and not done any of this and the economy would be just [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=809.8s)]
*  Chugging along great right that is largely what he did in his first term like his major economic accomplishment was not fucking up Barack Obama's economy [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=816.1999999999999s)]
*  Yes, he just did they pass his tax cut. It didn't do really do anything other than enrich shareholders [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=823.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he did it when accomplishment was adding to the deficit [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=829.0799999999999s)]
*  Yes [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=832.3199999999999s)]
*  He did definitely have people richer but in that in that period from 2017 to before kovat kicked in [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=832.3599999999999s)]
*  Basically just kind of chugged along the same economy [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=837.88s)]
*  And didn't do he didn't try to mess with this time. He tried to mess with it and we're all paying the price [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=840.64s)]
*  Literally one person who's not concerned about the impact of Donald Trump's trade war on their personal finances Donald Trump [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=844.9s)]
*  Who's very busy abusing his office to make himself richer? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=852.14s)]
*  That's right, Dan. It's time for another [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=855.9s)]
*  Corrupt date you think that's gonna stick. I don't know. I mean it really will be up to us to make it stick [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=858.42s)]
*  Like we would just have to do it a lot then it would be there working [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=864.46s)]
*  We're in charge sort of if you have any questions or complaints just direct them to John Lovett [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=867.14s)]
*  On Wednesday a website hyping the Trump meme coin announced the Trump would host an exclusive dinner for the [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=871.22s)]
*  220 people who own the most tokens to be held at a Trump Club in Virginia [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=876.66s)]
*  Followed by a private tour of the White House for the top 25 investors [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=880.9s)]
*  This caused the coins price to jump 60% [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=885.9s)]
*  Which is money in Trump's pocket because his family's company owns a majority of the coins [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=889.02s)]
*  The website announcing all this get Trump memes calm [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=893.7s)]
*  Says it has a leaderboard going for the people who've bought the most so far [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=897.5s)]
*  You have to register to see it, which I have not had the time to do yet [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=901.02s)]
*  But the copy says the competition is fierce own Trump or watch from the sidelines [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=904.02s)]
*  Josh Dossie at the Wall Street Journal reported that even White House aides were surprised by the promotion [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=910.86s)]
*  And you've got some of the most corrupt goobers in the world in the White House and they're like, I don't know about that [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=916.62s)]
*  Are you in are you on the sidelines? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=923.06s)]
*  Are you in are you on the sidelines? I could not be further on the sidelines. I [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=925.06s)]
*  Guess you're not gonna own Trump [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=931.0999999999999s)]
*  Not in it not in a financial sense [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=933.54s)]
*  No, so I know that there's like a lot of people aren't familiar with how meme coins work [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=935.42s)]
*  I was one of them until like I don't know a couple months ago last year [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=940.7399999999999s)]
*  It does seem like this is a case though of like blatant corruption [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=944.18s)]
*  That's not too hard to explain and should make people most voters pretty pissed [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=948.26s)]
*  Yeah, you do not need to understand what a meme coin is to understand that this is [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=953.4599999999999s)]
*  Trump selling access to the White House pure and simple and to himself [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=959.02s)]
*  Right. It's access to right access to the president [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=965.0999999999999s)]
*  So whoever spent spends the most money to put money in is it's legal at quasi legalized bribery [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=967.38s)]
*  Yeah, whoever spends the most money will get to get to the president to bend his ear for the whatever their [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=972.66s)]
*  Chosen policy goal is or more likely pardon that they would like and it's just I want to just explain this a little bit [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=977.5799999999999s)]
*  Which is Trump makes money here in two ways [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=984.0999999999999s)]
*  One he makes money his his company and his family make money off the sale of every coin [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=987.8199999999999s)]
*  So every one of these people who is buying one of these coins to meet Trump is paying him when they do it [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=993.6999999999999s)]
*  And then they were inflating the worth of each individual coin Trump's family owns a ton of them [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=997.88s)]
*  So his net worth goes up. And so whenever he [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1002.74s)]
*  Does the rug pull and sell some of his coins? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1005.5999999999999s)]
*  He will make a whole bunch more money because of this you could not this is just how gross this is is if this [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1008.0799999999999s)]
*  Was a campaign fundraiser, it would be illegal. You could not do this in the White House. You could not [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1013.28s)]
*  Invite ask people to give money for the specific purpose of getting a White House tour or a meeting with the president the White House [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1020.8s)]
*  You can only that's a way and that money doesn't go to him [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1025.72s)]
*  And you're not allowed to and that would be have transparency about who did it [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1028.36s)]
*  There's transparent here because there's a fucking leaderboard mother [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1033.04s)]
*  It's not I haven't seen the leaderboard, but I don't think it's giving name occupation and state like the FEC does so there's transparency [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1035.52s)]
*  If it was campaign financing and you would [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1044.24s)]
*  And none of that money could theoretically go to the president so we can't spend it on his own stuff [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1048.36s)]
*  This is going directly into his bank account. We have people [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1053.66s)]

*  It is the most corrupt thing that any president Richard Nixon included has ever done hands down. It's not even close. I [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1062.4s)]
*  was just thinking about this and we should ask one of our strict scrutiny pals, but [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1070.64s)]

*  within his [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1085.84s)]
*  Official duties as president feels like this is outside of that. I don't know how you [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1088.1599999999999s)]
*  I don't know how you could make because I think that one of the [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1093.9599999999998s)]
*  One of the examples people brought up was like, oh could you just bribe the president for a pardon? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1098.04s)]
*  And you could say well the pardon power is his power as president [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1102.6799999999998s)]
*  But this is like there's how is any of this related to any official act of the president? It's I mean, it's obviously not [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1105.8799999999999s)]
*  It's clearly I think he could be prosecuted for this [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1113.76s)]
*  I would love to see the legal brief making the case and this is somehow adjacent to crypto policy something the president is in charge [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1116.44s)]
*  Of yeah, I mean David tax is gonna get to work on that one [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1122.72s)]
*  Yeah, this is bad [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1125.56s)]
*  This is one that I think people should talk about and people everyone should know about this because it is especially as they you go [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1126.44s)]

*  And then you turn on the news and the Trump meme coin just jumped 60% [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1141.84s)]
*  Because he's walking around the White House with the top investors just [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1146.6999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. Well, I don't know that seems like you could make something out of that [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1150.8s)]
*  Alright speaking of rich assholes the richest and the biggest made some news this week [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1153.8s)]

*  Just heartbreaking heartbreaking that he's leaving such a loss [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1175.24s)]
*  we learned this on Tuesday after the news broke that Tesla's net income for the first quarter fell 71% and [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1178.88s)]
*  Revenue dropped 9% from the same period last year. Is that is that good? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1185.3200000000002s)]
*  I am NOT a business guy, but seems like no [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1189.68s)]
*  Elon made an appearance on the company's earnings call to offer his best guess as to why that might be and what happens now [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1193.0s)]
*  Let's listen as some people know if there's been some blowback for the time that I've been spending in government with the Department of Government [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1199.3999999999999s)]

*  Just to make sure that the waste and fraud that we [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1235.6399999999999s)]
*  Stop does not come roaring back Trump was then asked about this in the Oval Office on Wednesday night [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1238.44s)]
*  Here's what he said can't speak more highly about any individual. He's an incredible guy. He's a brilliant guy [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1243.72s)]
*  He's a wonderful person. I've seen him with his family [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1250.1399999999999s)]
*  I've seen with a lot of his children's got a lot of children and he was a tremendous help both in the campaign [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1254.08s)]
*  And in what he's done with doge [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1261.4s)]
*  I also know that he was treated very unfairly by the I guess he caught the public by some of the public [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1263.6s)]
*  Not by all of it. I said he makes an incredible car makes everything he does is good, but they took it out on [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1271.16s)]
*  Tesla and I just thought it was so unfair poor Tesla Tesla [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1277.76s)]
*  Note the past tense there. He was a tremendous help. We also learned that [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1284.0s)]
*  Elon and Scott Besson [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1288.32s)]
*  The Treasury Secretary apparently got into a shouting match recently outside the oval about who would run the IRS [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1290.36s)]
*  because Scott Besson wanted a [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1298.0s)]
*  competent experienced [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1301.52s)]
*  Professional to run the IRS and Elon wanted the random quote-unquote whistleblower [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1303.44s)]
*  That yelled something about Hunter Biden and some scandal that I can barely remember at this point [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1310.16s)]
*  Who was just some like mid-level flunky? He wanted him to run the IRS [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1314.6s)]
*  So they fought about that outside the oval at one point Elon called Besson a Soros agent [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1317.74s)]
*  So welcome. Welcome to the club Scott [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1324.0s)]
*  First of all, how much of Tesla's problems? Sorry Tesla's problems are attributable to the blowback that Trump was talking about and [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1327.96s)]
*  What other factors were in play in other words did we the woke mob just score a big win [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1335.76s)]
*  Yes, the big win for the book Bob. No [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1341.36s)]
*  Tesla probably has four problems [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1343.9199999999998s)]
*  The first is the guy who runs the company's been doing everything but run the company for a while now. Usually a problem [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1346.1999999999998s)]
*  Too. It's hard to know how much [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1352.52s)]
*  the political blowback [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1355.12s)]
*  impacted sales, but just common sense is [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1357.1999999999998s)]
*  The use of the the consumer the customer base for Tesla is [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1360.16s)]
*  Generally, maybe they should well testler [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1366.8s)]
*  They could use a brand refresh is generally well-to-do climate conscious liberals. Mm-hmm [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1370.2s)]
*  People who probably [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1376.4s)]
*  Are super into buying cars from a company run by a guy tweeting about replacement theory at three in the morning [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1378.4s)]
*  Yeah, it is the people who crawled across glass to vote for Susan Crawford and in Wisconsin. Yes, exactly [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1383.44s)]
*  Exactly [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1389.6000000000001s)]
*  Three is the tariffs they've mentioned in the call [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1391.24s)]
*  It's hard to know exactly how much that is going to affect them over the shortly in the near term here [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1393.88s)]
*  But they get a lot of their parts from overseas and the last thing is there's more competition in the EV market [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1398.24s)]
*  There are just more companies making better cars [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1403.8000000000002s)]
*  And so if you have a choice between two pretty good EVs of similar price [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1406.3600000000001s)]
*  You really really gonna pick the one from Elon Musk. Maybe not well, and I think especially [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1410.96s)]
*  orders for Tesla from Europe [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1415.88s)]
*  We're way down. Yeah, this is true about that home and abroad Europeans. You think we're we're mad at Elon [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1418.56s)]
*  They're pretty mad because he goes over there and he's like, hey, what about the Nazis? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1422.72s)]
*  not really say that but that was [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1426.32s)]
*  It was a shorthand for one of his many speeches over there in Europe [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1428.52s)]
*  What do you make of Elon's departure on the one hand? It was kind of expected. He [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1433.04s)]
*  Was designated a special government employee, which you can only be for a certain amount of time [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1438.24s)]
*  But if you're longer than that then it triggers like, you know [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1443.34s)]
*  Disclosure disclosure ethics stuff all the stuff that Elon would want to avoid [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1447.44s)]
*  so we knew he was gonna leave at some point, but [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1451.64s)]
*  you know on the other hand Trump's cabinet and [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1455.4s)]
*  Most Americans have really come to dislike Elon. So what do you think weird in the American people and Pete? [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1459.8000000000002s)]
*  Hicks have to can agree on something [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1466.28s)]
*  It I think it's a pretty big deal first. I think it's worth saying it is he really leaving like yeah when [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1468.8400000000001s)]
*  Companies have a very bad quarter. They tend to want to announce something on the earnings call that suggests [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1476.52s)]
*  They have a plan to fix the problem. And so Elon saying he's returning he's getting out of government coming back [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1482.92s)]
*  Solves the political backlash problem and the problem of the absentee [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1490.6000000000001s)]
*  Landlord at Tesla and so that that is a reason to give to minimize [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1494.4s)]
*  The market fallout right after the earnings call and it actually I think in this case did a little bit [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1500.0800000000002s)]
*  Solve some of those problems. So is he really leaving? It's not a super honest guy [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1505.46s)]
*  I don't know, but if he is leaving I do think this is the functional end of Doge. Mm-hmm [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1509.1000000000001s)]
*  He I mean who else is gonna have the power to actually do the things he's doing right to bully Kevin so poorly [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1514.3s)]
*  Yeah, do it. Absolutely poorly like he everything he's doing is [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1522.14s)]
*  It's incompetent, but it is severe and it's very hard to get severe cuts in [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1526.22s)]
*  Washington and he's able to do those in the worst way possible don't get me wrong because he he is more powerful [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1531.38s)]
*  Both within more powerful globally and more influential with Trump than anyone who serves in his cabinet [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1537.7s)]
*  But if there's someone else running doge like what flunky is gonna be able to end run Scott Besson to [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1543.3000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump no one we should also take a take a look at a Doge report card here Elon [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1549.74s)]
*  He originally set out to [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1556.1000000000001s)]
*  He said he could get he could find two trillion dollars in savings two trillion then he he cut that down to one trillion and [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1558.7s)]
*  Now you know what they've saved about 95 billion [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1567.3799999999999s)]
*  So much less than what he wanted and that's not even counting the savings that are being held up in court, correct? [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1571.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, right. And [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1577.1s)]
*  So what do you get for 95 billion dollars in savings that go into the? [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1578.86s)]
*  Tax people taxpayers saving a lot of money getting a lot of rebates [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1582.7s)]
*  No, that means about over 200,000 people lost their jobs from federal government [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1585.64s)]
*  Including cancer researchers veterans jobs food inspectors tax collectors, which is probably gonna undo the savings [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1591.0s)]
*  Because now a bunch of rich people are gonna get to cheat on their taxes and not pay them to the federal government. So [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1598.76s)]
*  Chaos around the Social Security administration, which then they had to pull back [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1603.68s)]
*  Bunch of people died all around the world. Thanks to [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1608.8s)]
*  The him putting USAID in the wood chipper, which he bragged about [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1612.2s)]
*  Nick Kristoff was tweeting about how [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1617.52s)]
*  He tweeted at Elon this week about how there's a boy in Africa who was born with HIV [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1620.76s)]
*  Who's kept alive by medicine that cost 12 cents a day? He's dead now and [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1625.68s)]
*  You can you know look the reports of this all over the world people have already died because of this more people will die [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1632.0800000000002s)]
*  because of [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1638.48s)]
*  Medicine that we took away and food that we took away that cost pennies a day pennies a day [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1639.8s)]

*  Deportations there's been more churn in the courts on this on Tuesday [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1867.78s)]
*  US District Court judge Paula Zinnis slammed the DOJ over what she called a [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1871.7s)]
*  Quote willful and intentional refusal to comply with her order to return Kilmer abrigo Garcia and accused the government of dishonesty and obstruction [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1876.26s)]
*  then on Wednesday in a totally separate case a [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1883.98s)]
*  Trump appointed judge Stephanie Gallagher ordered the return of another wrongly deported man this time [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1887.7199999999998s)]
*  It was a Venezuelan asylum seeker whose removal violated a court settlement another unlawful deportation [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1893.76s)]
*  Gallagher cited the abrigo Garcia case in her ruling and called the government's actions quote a breach of a contract [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1902.12s)]
*  But Trump's not just losing in the courts. He's also losing in the court of public opinion [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1909.3999999999999s)]
*  Multiple polls now have Trump underwater on immigration [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1913.04s)]
*  Which was his best issue including the latest Fox News poll that Trump was bitching about on truth social this morning [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1916.24s)]
*  Are you gov poll found Americans support bringing a break or Garcia back by nearly two to one margin? [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1923.12s)]
*  And only twenty or seven percent buy into Trump's claim that he's MS 13 a claim that the administration [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1929.36s)]
*  Still hasn't even tried to prove in court [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1935.6399999999999s)]
*  And we were just given [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1938.28s)]
*  Right here at Pod save America Dan [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1940.28s)]
*  We were just given an exclusive new poll from the Democratic research firm tavern research [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1941.8s)]
*  Which surveyed a huge sample of nearly 13,000 voters over the last few days [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1947.8s)]
*  a couple things that they found the abrigo Garcia case has certainly broke through to most voters [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1953.96s)]
*  Voters disapprove of how Trump is handling it by a 14 point margin [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1961.24s)]
*  Only 25 percent of voters believe Trump is following the law only 25 percent believe that it's okay for him to defy the court's orders [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1965.56s)]
*  Getting down to 25 percent. Usually he's got like 35 40 [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1972.8400000000001s)]
*  With almost anything he does so it's not a 25 percent and the most effective messages [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1976.72s)]
*  when talking about the case have to do with Trump defying the courts and [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1981.48s)]
*  In doing so putting the due process rights of all Americans at risk. Those were the most effective message [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1986.24s)]
*  What do you make of those numbers? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1992.28s)]
*  encouraging as an American yeah, just that there are [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1994.28s)]
*  Like Democrats that we talked with us last week [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1997.6399999999999s)]
*  But Democrats are sort of taught to be afraid of immigration and that here we have not just the moral high ground with the political [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=1999.7s)]
*  high ground and that we in the Democrats should [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2005.56s)]
*  Make the arguments against these illegal deportations with confidence. You should need a poll to talk about these things [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2008.3999999999999s)]
*  But if you do you now have the polling to give you to put some stiffen your spine a bit. Yeah, I also think [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2014.48s)]
*  It's a good lesson in [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2019.96s)]
*  How polling should be used because usually there's this argument like should we follow the polls should we not follow the polls and [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2022.52s)]
*  as you know [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2028.68s)]
*  Like polling is just another useful tool to use depending on how you use it, right? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2030.3600000000001s)]
*  and it is still true probably that most Americans want a secure border and [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2034.3600000000001s)]
*  you know want people who are criminals deported and [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2041.08s)]
*  there's a limit to how many even asylum seekers people want to take in because [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2045.08s)]
*  They saw over the last couple years that a lot of asylum seekers were sort of stretching public services in cities all across the country [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2049.56s)]
*  And those views I don't think haven't changed but that is entirely separate from also believing [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2054.92s)]
*  That we should send people to a gulag or we should deport people without due process or any of the stuff that he's doing [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2061.0s)]
*  and there's a nuance there that I think sometimes the [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2066.84s)]
*  Interparty fighting among Democrats doesn't really get at least online [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2071.2000000000003s)]
*  Obviously but that like two things can be true at once and [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2075.84s)]
*  Just because immigration is a good issue for Trump doesn't mean that no matter what he does around immigration [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2080.28s)]
*  It's going to be popular. Yeah, it's we we all lost our mind on [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2086.88s)]
*  the politics of immigration from like [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2091.76s)]
*  2022 until now. Yeah, are you really like 2016 on no? [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2095.1200000000003s)]
*  I think during the Trump era all we had to do in the first Trump one point [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2098.6800000000003s)]
*  All we had to do was point out that what Trump was doing was bad and cruel and stupid and counterproductive [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2102.4s)]
*  And we actually quite effective that like I was looking at the polling today [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2107.32s)]
*  Trump was underwater on immigration for almost every single day of his first term. Yes, this is I think I'm sorry [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2110.2000000000003s)]
*  I think the reaction the reaction from Democrats in the 2020 primary [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2116.52s)]
*  Yeah to the prior four years we got example of [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2121.8s)]
*  Misreading this reading what the anger about Trump on immigration was all about. Yes [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2125.7200000000003s)]
*  100% but for a long time we had a very good message on immigration, which was [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2129.7200000000003s)]
*  border security [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2135.4s)]
*  Keep people safe have a path to citizenship for people who have been here a long time [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2136.6800000000003s)]
*  Are part of the community have them go to the back of the line payback taxes [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2142.28s)]
*  What if like there was it there was a method that tested for that? [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2146.12s)]
*  Are you saying we're a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws? [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2148.48s)]
*  Just Barack Obama's message. Well, I mean that that position still to this day gets [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2151.96s)]
*  Majority support and when we constrain the image only to the way much Trump wants to talk about it like I think [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2158.02s)]
*  What we did wrong and I think it's still keeping people from do it for a lot of people from talking about this in the [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2165.42s)]
*  Right way is we really accepted Trump's premise [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2170.82s)]
*  Like he created this is something the right Trump and the right-wing media did very successfully which is they [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2173.78s)]
*  created this image of an I [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2180.02s)]
*  They took legitimate issues around chaos at the border of migrants coming here seeking asylum and [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2182.3s)]
*  Turned it into an invasion by MS 13 and trend a Aragwa. They turned it into this idea that there was this [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2188.3s)]
*  wave of crime from migrants and [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2195.38s)]
*  Undocumented immigrants that you were unsafe for them because of this and that wasn't actually the case [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2197.94s)]
*  But we accepted that premise in our messaging [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2202.14s)]
*  Right. We were like we said last week we're trying to out tough Trump on the borders of those are talking about [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2204.3s)]
*  How you doing he is suffering this and if I was in the White House and [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2208.46s)]
*  How's my husband which is really a hard thing to imagine but if I were [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2212.9s)]
*  these numbers would scare the shit out of me, right like you have a [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2216.0600000000004s)]
*  Two-pronged reason why you're president the economy and immigration and you're not underwater on both and we haven't even hit the hundred-day mark [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2219.34s)]
*  I think it's also a lesson [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2224.86s)]
*  for Democrats that like [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2227.6600000000003s)]
*  if you pick fights about issues where first of all, you think it's wrong and [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2229.98s)]
*  It's it's urgent to speak out but also you sort of sense that [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2235.2200000000003s)]
*  What the politician is doing what Trump is doing is unpopular [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2240.26s)]
*  Like you can make it you can you can have these issues break through right? Like there could have been [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2244.46s)]
*  When he sent a brego Garcia [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2250.54s)]
*  To Salvador when he's well Salvador to this prison when he deported we could have said, okay, you know what? [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2253.46s)]
*  Since he's so strong on immigration. We just shouldn't talk about this [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2259.3s)]
*  But if we didn't talk about it if Democrats all decided not to talk about this and not to make a big deal of it [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2263.26s)]
*  Then he probably still would be very popular in immigration because most people in the country wouldn't know that it happened [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2267.98s)]
*  Yes, we have agency here. This is the same thing happened. We just talked about Doge, right? [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2273.5800000000004s)]
*  It's the beginning of Doge. It was like well [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2278.1000000000004s)]
*  We got to be careful because a lot of Democrats and Republicans and independents most Americans [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2279.6000000000004s)]
*  They do want government to be more efficient and that's what he's doing. So maybe we should just be quiet [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2283.98s)]
*  It's like okay, yeah, that's true if Elon Musk was actually going in there and making government more efficient and actually saving money [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2288.2599999999998s)]
*  On things that were wasteful. He wasn't doing that. So we should talk about it [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2296.2599999999998s)]
*  and I just think that like Trump is not as strong as people think he is and [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2300.3399999999997s)]
*  He still has a lot of power and he's still very dangerous [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2305.74s)]
*  But the country right now is is not particularly happy with him and his approval rating continues to fall [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2308.42s)]
*  I think in the Pew poll this week was at 40 and that's probably an outlier [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2315.32s)]
*  It's probably it's probably around 44 45, but it's still his approval ratings at a lower point [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2319.1000000000004s)]
*  Right now than almost any president at this point in their first term other than recent memory other than him [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2325.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's about to cross that line. He's I think in the average he is [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2330.48s)]
*  Almost seven points underwater right now and he's been dropping a point a week. Yes for for a while now [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2335.48s)]
*  And this is not to say okay, he's getting more unpopular [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2341.34s)]
*  Everyone can just be like whoo relax and and just wait for the next election and where it's thermostatic public opinion [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2344.34s)]
*  Everything's gonna be fine [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2350.54s)]
*  It's to say that like we don't need to be afraid or we shouldn't be afraid because the more we fight the more unpopular [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2351.2200000000003s)]
*  He gets and so like, you know courage is contagious here. You should go speak out [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2356.98s)]
*  You should go keep fighting because when we do other people in the country who aren't paying attention realize like yeah [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2361.34s)]
*  He's this is this is bad. I don't like this [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2366.6600000000003s)]
*  Which brings us to our last topic [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2369.86s)]
*  Before we get to our conversation with Amanda on Tuesday the longtime executive producer of 60 minutes [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2373.06s)]
*  Bill Owens announced that he's stepping down saying he can't run the show independently anymore [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2378.82s)]
*  This comes of course after Trump called again for CBS to lose its broadcast license over some recent segments on 60 minutes [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2383.6600000000003s)]
*  And after he filed a 20 billion dollar lawsuit against CBS for the way the show edited its interview with Kamala Harris [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2389.7400000000002s)]
*  And CBS News's parent company Paramount, which is trying to close a major merger is talking about settling [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2396.52s)]
*  How big of a deal do you think this is if I was writing a book which I am not? [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2403.96s)]
*  About the you can announce it here if you want. I mean you do have a publishing arms. Maybe we should talk now [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2408.7999999999997s)]
*  if I was writing a book about [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2414.56s)]
*  the death of the traditional [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2416.7599999999998s)]
*  Objective media that dominated the 20th century in the first part of the 21st century [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2420.2799999999997s)]
*  The lead anecdote would be what just happened bill Owens 60 minutes 60 minutes is the flagship new show in America [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2424.7599999999998s)]
*  No, like so known for tough accountability journalism [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2432.12s)]
*  That if you worked at a company or a government agency and a 60 minutes producer called you you wet your pants [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2435.64s)]
*  Yeah, like it meant you were in big trouble and the fact that now [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2441.3799999999997s)]
*  even 60 minutes is being brought to heel by [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2446.3599999999997s)]
*  the core its corporate overlords means [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2449.8799999999997s)]
*  The entire model of [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2452.88s)]
*  Big media owned by big corporations cannot function [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2456.2400000000002s)]
*  There is an inherent irreconcilable tension between companies with business before the federal government [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2461.0s)]
*  Owning media companies trying to hold that federal government accountable. Like this is this is the end of an era where we are right now [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2469.48s)]
*  and again, it's like you I [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2473.88s)]
*  mean Sherry Redstone and [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2476.2000000000003s)]
*  Who's the [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2478.68s)]
*  Paramount, you know trying to close a merger. So I mean, it's just all about money for her, right? [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2480.2s)]
*  Maybe she just wants a deal [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2484.48s)]
*  but I think it is for other media companies that can for other people in media for these colleges for the law firms like [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2485.4399999999996s)]
*  people should fight because [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2494.6s)]
*  All I think that all of the people that have capitulated so far are going to look they're not gonna be like, oh that was smart [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2497.52s)]
*  They got away early it's gonna look bad and and if you and again just we were talking about the polling like [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2504.04s)]
*  Some of these media companies if you ask people [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2510.6s)]
*  Oh should the government be able to sue media companies into oblivion or threaten them pull their licenses because they said [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2512.48s)]
*  they said things that the [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2520.32s)]
*  Ruler Donald Trump doesn't care for that's not fucking popular. No one's gonna think that's a good idea [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2523.32s)]
*  Yeah [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2528.84s)]
*  There's very explicit polling on colleges and museums that it shows that what Donald Trump is using federal funding as leverage is quite a [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2529.32s)]
*  public even with Republicans, but what is going on here is [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2534.48s)]
*  Just it's important to understand that be like there was a time in which CBS was a huge part of [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2538.52s)]
*  the revenue at [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2547.44s)]
*  Paramount yeah CBS News in particular see that is not true anymore [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2549.6400000000003s)]
*  Right. CNN is like which is owned by Warner Brothers Discovery [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2553.4s)]
*  Which is a company that by all reporting very much wants to either merge with another company or buy another company in all cases would [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2557.64s)]
*  need approval from the FCC and [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2565.0s)]
*  So they are not willing to take on water for something that is even if it still makes money now [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2567.7599999999998s)]
*  They know is in in secular decline and is never coming back [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2573.16s)]
*  Yeah, and so the thing about like I don't think you're able to convince these major companies who? [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2576.5s)]
*  To fight back like Sherry Redstone or some of these other companies like even Disney [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2583.04s)]
*  Gave in on the George Stephanopoulos. Yep defamation suit like the way you fight back here to support independent media [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2588.52s)]
*  Yes, right [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2594.88s)]
*  And that is that can be ideological partisan media like what we have here pro-democracy media like what we have here at Crooked Media [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2595.48s)]
*  it could be like ProPublica and nonprofit independent media, but [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2601.6800000000003s)]
*  The future of media is gonna look very different than did before and it's gonna be much is gonna be smaller [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2605.84s)]
*  But independent from these big companies [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2609.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. All right [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2612.12s)]

*  We're also psyched you chose to do it with crooked media reads because we've all been big fans of yours for a long time [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2803.8599999999997s)]
*  I am so excited to talk about it and it feels so right for this moment. Yes, it does [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2808.18s)]
*  Well, so want to spend time on the book thought we could start by [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2814.3399999999997s)]
*  Checking in on run for something which is the organization you launched after the first Trump administration with the goal of [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2818.2999999999997s)]
*  Recruiting training helping younger candidates run for down ballot races all over the country [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2824.92s)]
*  I'll admit that I was worried that after all the despair and fear that accompanied Trump's second win [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2830.62s)]
*  You guys would have a tougher time finding candidates to run that hasn't happened [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2837.34s)]
*  No, and I will admit I shared that concern but since Trump won in November we have had [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2841.46s)]
*  41,000 young people all across the country raised their hands to say they want to run our [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2848.18s)]
*  Overall pipeline has exceeded [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2852.26s)]
*  200,000 that means 20% of the people who have ever [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2854.42s)]
*  Signed up with run for something to say they want to run for office have come to us in the last five months [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2857.54s)]
*  And how does that compare to the first so in the first two years of Trump's first term? [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2861.7400000000002s)]
*  We had 30,000 people sign up why we've already exceeded that it is more people than I ever could have imagined like our goal for [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2866.1s)]
*  2025 was 50,000 we're gonna cross that in like a month [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2873.26s)]
*  Are you seeing a different kind of person stepping up different kind of candidate or or and where they're running? [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2875.82s)]
*  So we are getting people from all 50 states. It's pretty commensurate with population little more women than men about [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2880.82s)]
*  70 to 75 percent under the age of 40 [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2887.1000000000004s)]
*  So it's mostly young people and we are seeing people step up for a lot of the issues [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2889.42s)]
*  We've seen over the last eight years housing, you know cost of housing [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2893.46s)]
*  reproductive health book bans, especially in the last few years [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2897.0600000000004s)]
*  Opioids continues to be a big thing we hear from people but especially in the last five months [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2900.46s)]
*  They are signing up and saying if my leaders aren't gonna fight for me [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2904.7400000000002s)]
*  I am gonna fight for me and I think that in particular is a really exciting attitude. We're seeing new folks bring that's awesome [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2908.68s)]
*  I saw that you were wrong for something is hosting an informational session for fired formal federal workers. That's what I say [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2914.96s)]
*  Tell me a little bit about like what is going on there? Do you think those folks make good candidates? [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2923.72s)]
*  And and what is sparking their interest to run? [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2928.4s)]
*  So we've seen hundreds of people sign up coming specifically from conversations around former laid-off federal workers or people who've had partners or friends or family [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2930.44s)]
*  Countless more beyond that and I think these are folks are already inclined towards public service [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2938.92s)]
*  You know, they have been working in the federal government not a glamorous job [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2943.68s)]
*  All across the country because as you guys know and as folks know the federal government is not just a DC thing [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2947.96s)]
*  It is everywhere and I think for a lot of them. This is personal. They understand intimately how government works and affects people's lives [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2952.84s)]
*  they're pissed at Trump and Elon Musk for firing them or firing their friend or their family and [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2960.44s)]
*  They've often not been allowed to run for office before like in most places [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2966.68s)]
*  There's some nuance here depending on the type of office you run and what your job is [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2970.72s)]
*  But generally speaking federal government employees have not been allowed to run for office before there's been some ethics violation rules around that [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2974.16s)]
*  They're now free to [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2980.4s)]
*  They've got a lot of time on their hands and they got a lot of rage and they're channeling it into doing something really [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2982.12s)]
*  Meaningful with it [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2987.12s)]
*  So I think they're gonna be great candidates if even a couple of them end up getting on the ballot in [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2987.9s)]
*  2026 the stories that they'll be able to tell both about why they're mad and how they've committed to their community are gonna be really powerful [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2991.94s)]
*  Are these like former scientists former all across the board or Park Rangers former scientists former fellows doing like weather research? [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=2998.7000000000003s)]
*  You know for more VA people doctors and health care professionals who are working in the government all kinds of experts who've really like [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3006.36s)]
*  Done meaningful work and shown how government can make people's lives better, which most people don't get to hear their stories [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3013.46s)]
*  You touch on this your book is largely about this but the debate about the generational divide the Democratic Party has been brewing for a long time [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3018.28s)]
*  It's obviously picked up pace since this election since [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3026.6400000000003s)]
*  Biden's the end of Biden's presidency [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3031.2400000000002s)]
*  How do you think about generational split? Is it is it really? [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3033.5600000000004s)]
*  Age or is it styled to right? We obviously have folks like Bernie Sanders who? [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3037.96s)]
*  Is much older but is very popular with young people and probably campaigns and talks about politics in a way that makes young people [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3043.4s)]
*  Excited so talk to me a little bit that split and where you think it's going obviously no generation is a monolith [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3049.36s)]
*  We have seen older leaders like Senator Sanders rise to the occasion and really prove they can can fight and communicate in this moment [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3053.86s)]
*  That being said I don't think it's a coincidence that many of the folks who have risen up who have shown their backbone [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3059.68s)]
*  And who have proven they can communicate about that fight in this moment are some of the younger leaders [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3065.42s)]
*  And I would say it is both age sort of you know Millennials and Gen Z folks will give younger Gen X [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3070.48s)]
*  But it is also like people whose political awakening has been since Trump like people who first got into politics [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3079.56s)]
*  post 2015 2016 [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3087.48s)]
*  Who have a very clear-eyed understanding of who the Republican Party is is not judge W Bush's Republican Party [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3089.4s)]
*  It's not John McCain's it's not Mitt Romney's it is Trump's and they know who the opponent is and that these are not good faith [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3095.84s)]
*  partners in governance and [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3101.76s)]
*  Because they're comfortable online like I like to joke these are candidates and elected to run their own Instagram accounts [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3103.76s)]
*  Which is pretty unusual they understand how to [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3109.6800000000003s)]
*  Express that in this moment. How do you think this next generation of leaders should be? [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3113.6400000000003s)]
*  Responding to Trump 2.0 like how do we end what you've called the bad boomer leadership that's taken over the Democratic Party [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3120.3999999999996s)]
*  You know, I think it's a couple things [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3126.6s)]
*  I think again being clear right about who the Republican Party is and who they are not I [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3129.72s)]
*  think [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3134.12s)]
*  Being willing to like channel whatever it is. They're really mad about and communicate it [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3135.56s)]
*  You know, we we have this moment in which authenticity or this perceived authenticity is so important for candidates and it is especially [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3140.24s)]
*  Important for newer candidates who are trying to like prove themselves and build trust with voters [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3148.8s)]
*  When we talk about like what messaging we should be on or like what fight should we take on pick the fight that makes you [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3154.1600000000003s)]
*  The maddest and talk about it [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3159.8s)]
*  Because if you're talking about the thing that you aren't actually that riled up about it's gonna come through [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3161.1200000000003s)]
*  It's not gonna make connect with people [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3166.6000000000004s)]
*  The other thing I would say is that especially in this moment like being unafraid to have the conversation in as many places as possible [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3168.84s)]
*  This is something I think people who haven't are relatively new to public service into politics can do a little bit better not exclusively [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3176.2799999999997s)]
*  But can do a little bit better because they are normal people who just happen to have fallen into public service as opposed to people [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3182.72s)]
*  Who've been in office for 20 or 30 years and like don't know what normal people talk about anymore [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3189.72s)]
*  So I think that's one of the many distinctions. We haven't talked about this in the pod yet [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3194.9599999999996s)]
*  But I'm sure you've heard about DNC vice-chair David Hogg pledging [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3198.8399999999997s)]
*  20 million dollars to primary older Democrats in safe seats [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3202.96s)]
*  What do you think of the strategy any risks [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3208.64s)]
*  Whether or not David as a DNC leader is the right person to do this is sort of a separate [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3211.7200000000003s)]
*  Question that I think the DNC is trying to handle as we speak [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3217.8s)]
*  That seems like a them problem. Yeah, I do think it is worth encouraging open primaries [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3221.56s)]
*  Primaries are how we as a party decide what we believe parties are where? [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3226.88s)]
*  Candidates get a chance to prove their medal and sort of safe territory [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3230.64s)]
*  Especially in all these safe blue districts. That's where we get our Democratic leaders from like it's not a coincidence that much of the Democratic leadership [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3233.64s)]
*  Is from New York, California and Illinois like those are safe seats [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3239.96s)]
*  So the people who can rise there tend to be both the cream of the crop ideally and can really [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3243.92s)]
*  Ideally model what the party is standing for in this moment. I [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3250.2400000000002s)]
*  Think if you're an incumbent who's doing a good job [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3253.88s)]
*  I think if you're an incumbent who's doing a good job [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3256.32s)]
*  You got a pretty high chance of winning a primary like incumbents have something like a 95% reelection rate [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3258.92s)]
*  If you are doing a good job and meeting your constituents where they are, you should have nothing to worry about [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3265.32s)]
*  I think it's telling that some of these incumbents are a little spooked [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3269.52s)]
*  Because they know they're not quite where their voters want them to be. Yeah, I'm very torn about this [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3273.92s)]
*  Like I very much agree open primaries are good [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3278.6400000000003s)]
*  we do like we 100% need a new generation of leadership and in a world in which [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3281.1600000000003s)]
*  most [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3286.52s)]
*  Incumbents are gonna win their election [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3287.8s)]
*  Then the only way you're gonna you're just gonna be there until they leave like if you went like Adam Schiff can be senator from [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3289.5600000000004s)]
*  California for the rest of his life. Yeah, that's right [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3295.76s)]
*  Like that is he could literally die in office as previous centers California have done [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3298.28s)]
*  I mean, there's there might be some past precedent there, but I guess we've on your own or in a [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3302.1200000000003s)]
*  Cool cool slogan [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3309.28s)]
*  Absent a primary I guess the question but I guess one question I have is is it maybe things have changed recently [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3312.2400000000002s)]
*  but a lot of the conversations I've had with various groups and people trying to fund efforts since election as it has been a [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3317.1200000000003s)]
*  Tough environment to raise money. A lot of our donors are not necessarily the grassroots donors [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3325.0s)]
*  But sort of the bigger folks who fund larger the larger progressive infrastructure are tapped out. They're frustrated [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3330.32s)]
*  They're not giving me money. And so just in a world where we need run for something [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3336.32s)]
*  We need invisible. We need swing laughs. We need more progressive media more content [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3341.2799999999997s)]
*  Like what do you think about 20 million dollars to this effort? [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3345.0s)]
*  I think it's a drop in the bucket compared to what we spend in a lot of federal races [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3347.88s)]
*  I also think most of these primary candidates are gonna be funded by grassroots donors. They're not gonna get a lot of institutional money and [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3351.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, I will say run for something's budget this year's only seven and a half million dollars and we're expecting to work with about [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3359.92s)]
*  300 candidates in every state. There's an election [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3365.3599999999997s)]
*  We've already won I think 20 some odd races this year [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3367.8s)]
*  There's a lot of ways that we could spend money in politics and there will always be more money even when I wish there were [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3372.4s)]
*  different rules around it, so [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3377.6000000000004s)]
*  If your goal is to get new leaders in that particular space, that's certainly one way you could do it [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3379.84s)]
*  I think my way is also really exciting another [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3384.44s)]
*  Be to donate to run for something. Yes, I'll say it for you. Thank you run for something.net slash donate [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3387.5600000000004s)]
*  No, five dollars goes a long way [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3391.76s)]
*  I kind of think you just we should all be consistent on it if you're for [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3393.36s)]
*  You know primaries and competitive primaries that's true for if you're worried about what the result may be [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3397.1s)]
*  It's true if you want the result to be a different way [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3402.38s)]
*  And I think we're probably stronger as a party, especially the democracy party [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3404.94s)]
*  If we're if we're allowing this to happen and it's really scary to trust voters [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3409.78s)]
*  But like if we're empowering candidates to run good campaigns, then we should and I think that's like the key here is we should give [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3413.6600000000003s)]
*  Candidates and this is what run for something does is empower candidates to make the best possible argument to their voters and then let voters decide [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3420.46s)]
*  Even if voters sometimes make decisions, I wouldn't agree with that's voters call which has happened recently [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3427.02s)]
*  Let's talk about your wonderful book, which isn't just advice for young people running for office [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3433.1800000000003s)]
*  It's for young people who are stepping into leadership roles or planning to step into leadership roles across business nonprofits [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3438.14s)]
*  What made you want to broaden the focus? So I [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3444.42s)]
*  Know politics. I've worked now with thousands of candidates running for office [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3447.6600000000003s)]
*  I knew I didn't know enough about what leadership looked like outside of this space [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3451.54s)]
*  So when I was going in to write the book [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3455.7799999999997s)]
*  I put out a call to interview as many people from as many different kinds of spaces as I could and I ended up having [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3457.58s)]
*  in-depth conversations with more than 135 different leaders from a variety of sectors [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3463.34s)]
*  I talked to faith leaders and doctors and teachers. I talked to tech CEOs. I talked to the CEO of Snapchat [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3468.08s)]
*  Evan Spiegel, I also talked to the editor-in-chief of Teen Vogue. I also talked to Maxwell Frost member of Congress [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3475.02s)]
*  And I heard so many themes echo across those conversations [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3481.28s)]
*  You know the the partner and the law firm in Chicago had a slightly different take on the 80 year old partner who she had to [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3486.0800000000004s)]
*  Like do it notes in the dictaphone for as opposed to the rabbi who said the person she replaced in Wisconsin [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3492.6000000000004s)]
*  Had never taken a day off in 30 years behind the pulpit and she was like, I'm a mom of two kids [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3498.84s)]
*  Like I can't do that [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3504.0800000000004s)]
*  But the themes were the same and I think that to me was emblematic of the fact that you know across different sectors across different [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3506.44s)]
*  spaces really across the country and even I talked to a few folks in Europe and in England [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3513.6s)]
*  Details were a little different there. They have better health care [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3519.88s)]
*  the [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3523.16s)]
*  challenges that next-gen leaders what I would collectively call next-gen leaders Millennials and Gen Z are facing are the same and [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3524.56s)]
*  That we didn't have a playbook on how to solve them [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3532.04s)]
*  So that's what I tried to write was the guide that honestly I wish I had had when I started run for something eight and [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3534.64s)]
*  A half years ago of like how do you do this in a way that is better than every boss? [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3540.12s)]
*  I've ever had before I was gonna say how did your own experience with leadership roles at run for something and other places? [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3543.9199999999996s)]
*  Inspire what you wrote, you know when I started run for something [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3550.8399999999997s)]
*  I was 26 about to turn 27 was single. It's having a good time. I [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3554.12s)]
*  Had never run a company before I'd never written a budget before I'd managed people I'd managed teams a few times [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3559.5600000000004s)]
*  But I knew that if this was gonna last if I was gonna build an organization that was sustainable [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3564.8s)]
*  And I would do this work for a long time because it was important that I thought this work needed a long runway to succeed [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3570.28s)]
*  That I built a team and ran my company in a way that reflected that [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3575.6400000000003s)]
*  So that was everything from how we could provide the best possible health care to people how we could pay people as well as possible [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3580.28s)]
*  How we could have work-life integration and work rest integration like I didn't want to work campaign hours for eight or ten years [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3586.48s)]
*  now [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3593.44s)]
*  Eight and a half years later. I have two kids like a two and a half year old and a seven month old [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3594.48s)]
*  I don't have the time to work hundred hour weeks anymore [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3598.84s)]
*  And I don't want to but the work is still really important [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3602.8s)]
*  So I write a ton and when we're in charge about my experience creating this organization that [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3606.7200000000003s)]
*  Functions a little differently than any other political organization, although some now have come our way including things like a four-day workweek [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3613.2000000000003s)]
*  As really good health care really good benefits [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3620.96s)]
*  Things like a sabbatical policy, but also, you know transparency policies internally that allow us to really communicate with people [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3625.28s)]
*  in a way that brings them in and helps guide where we're going and [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3632.32s)]
*  The challenges that I faced, you know when I went to take maternity leave with my first daughter and I googled [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3637.0s)]
*  How do I take maternity leave as the boss? [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3641.78s)]
*  All I could find was how to ask your boss for maternity leave which one damning indictment of the United States [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3643.94s)]
*  But to you know [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3649.78s)]
*  Really telling of like what kind of resources there are for leaders who want to model the values we put into practice [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3651.5800000000004s)]
*  You and I have talked about this before [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3657.26s)]
*  Since we've both had similar experiences here [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3659.2200000000003s)]
*  But can you get into some of the challenges you faced being a millennial at the top of an organization with a lot of? [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3661.5s)]
*  Gen Zers, it's so hard [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3668.3s)]
*  You know, it wasn't just things that I faced I heard this from all of the people I talked to [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3671.78s)]
*  the similar kinds of demands for transparency that in the same way you can Google something or get a Yelp review on something [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3677.1400000000003s)]
*  We want that at work. We want to be able to get every answer we want whenever we want it [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3684.0600000000004s)]
*  I heard this from folks about you know [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3688.36s)]
*  things that they wanted work to provide something that work is not the right space to hold and [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3691.1200000000003s)]
*  I write about this in the book of [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3694.98s)]
*  Work cannot be your only source of identity your only source of friendship your only source of your physical or mental health your well-being [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3697.58s)]
*  It is first and foremost an economic relationship [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3704.14s)]
*  And ideally as the leader you are creating space where people have the time and resources to be full people outside of it [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3706.8199999999997s)]
*  One of the challenges that basically every millennial and Gen Z leader [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3714.46s)]
*  I talked to named was that they're managing Millennials and Gen Z and that is both a blessing and a curse [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3717.7799999999997s)]
*  Yes, yes, we could do a whole other [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3723.8199999999997s)]
*  Love our Gen Z for me and my there all great lesson in the book. We don't dream of labor [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3728.5s)]
*  Can you unpack that a little bit and how it applies to what we're all going through right now? [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3733.06s)]
*  Okay, so the internet says this is a James Baldwin quote, but I cannot find any proof of that [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3737.46s)]
*  So make of that what you will the full quote here is that I do not have a dream job because I do not dream of labor [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3741.62s)]
*  I [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3747.9s)]
*  Think that is so important [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3749.06s)]
*  Especially in this moment where we are looking to do so much more than our work that [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3751.66s)]
*  Your job just cannot be everything and a nightmare is a kind of dream, too [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3756.58s)]
*  Sometimes your dream job could actually be horrific. I [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3762.54s)]
*  think it is really on the [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3766.62s)]
*  shoulders of the person in charge of the leader and I write on how to do this to make it clear that you should have a [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3769.94s)]
*  place at work where you can do your job and know what success looks like and [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3776.14s)]
*  That you don't have to be miserable every day doing it, but it also doesn't need to be the only place you find fulfillment [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3780.46s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard. It's hard, especially in in the business that we're all in [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3785.42s)]
*  I know because it is a mission and you do care and I've got a separated at some point [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3790.18s)]
*  I talked to a pastor who like really spoke to this Marshall hatch in Chicago who told me like, you know [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3794.86s)]
*  I feel like my work is a calling but also [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3800.54s)]
*  There could be lots of calls [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3803.54s)]
*  There could be lots of different ringtones in this call, yeah, it can look different and that doesn't mean that there's a [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3805.38s)]
*  Wrong way to love your job [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3811.9s)]
*  But it can also be really dangerous when you love your job so much that it eats you up and spits you out [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3813.94s)]
*  You talked about being a working mom now. What have you learned about rest? [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3818.94s)]
*  Not just for yourself, but as something leaders need to model for their teams [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3822.98s)]
*  You know so run for something has a four-day work week [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3827.78s)]
*  Which is the only way I was able to write this book run the organization at the time [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3830.06s)]
*  I had a one-year-old and I was pregnant. I [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3834.74s)]
*  Did that because we had Fridays so all through 2024 [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3836.98s)]
*  I was been Fridays not resting but working on this in a way that was also really creatively fulfilling and gave me [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3840.7s)]
*  Like a different kind of joy than my day job. I [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3847.2999999999997s)]
*  Think a lot about what it means as the boss to model rest for my team [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3851.3399999999997s)]
*  Like we really do take Fridays off. We don't have emails [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3854.7799999999997s)]
*  We don't have meetings when we're done with the day at around 5 36 o'clock. We log off on [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3857.66s)]
*  Weekends yeah, like sometimes you might have to work on a weekend like any job [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3862.5s)]
*  Sometimes you have to go to the event or like, you know, there's the emergency whatever but generally speaking [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3866.8599999999997s)]
*  You can count on weekends to be your own and I think about the way that the four-day work week the clear boundaries about [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3871.8599999999997s)]
*  Our time have made me a better boss a better leader [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3878.2599999999998s)]
*  But also such a better parent and a better partner [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3880.7s)]
*  Like I am so much better at going into a full 48 hours of parenting after I got to spend Friday [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3883.5s)]
*  Yeah, maybe doing some book stuff or some writing but also go to yoga class get my nails done see a friend [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3889.5s)]
*  Lounge on the couch and watch Grey's Anatomy for three hours like whatever it is [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3895.9s)]
*  I'm a better parent and a better partner because of that like in politics, right? [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3899.1800000000003s)]
*  Culture it like it is the worst version of like put on quote hustle culture, right? [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3903.78s)]
*  Like you were supposed to be working all the time and if you're not working all the time [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3908.36s)]
*  Like in the way, it's understood by so many people you're not working all the time [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3911.82s)]
*  Then either you're doing something wrong or you're not important enough to be working all the time [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3914.7000000000003s)]
*  Everyone's trying to work on time. How have you been able to run a political organization? [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3918.24s)]
*  not on that sort of [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3923.72s)]
*  24-7 treadmill that so much of politics and media seems to operate on you can [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3926.3199999999997s)]
*  Can be very discerning here. My mission is urgent and important [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3931.08s)]
*  not every task in service of that mission is urgent or important and [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3936.08s)]
*  So being really thoughtful and rigorous about prioritization about how we're spending time in meetings or together [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3941.2s)]
*  No, I'm be like, yeah a couple weeks before Election Day [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3948.56s)]
*  You might have to work a little bit more but you cannot do this work year in year out if you are burning the candle at [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3951.16s)]
*  Both ends like you will hate yourself and you won't be as good at it [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3957.3199999999997s)]
*  Like I don't think anyone who's working hundred hour weeks is doing that because those hours [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3961.7999999999997s)]
*  60 to 100 are their best hours like you're not getting your best stuff. I [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3967.12s)]
*  think it is so necessary for leaders to model those boundaries and [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3972.2s)]
*  Also to staff in such a way that you don't have to ask that for people [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3976.96s)]
*  Like I reject the premise that you have to be working around the clock to be getting the most possible things done [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3980.64s)]
*  Like efficacy and humane compassionate leadership are not mutually exclusive [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3987.2799999999997s)]
*  Last question you talked to more than a hundred young leaders for the book [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3992.08s)]
*  Was there a moment or a conversation that surprised you or changed how you thought about leadership? Oh, that's such a good question. I [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=3996.2799999999997s)]
*  Was surprised [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4005.7200000000003s)]
*  At how many things I heard in common. Hmm. I was surprised and maybe not in retrospect [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4007.8s)]
*  It's not surprising at all. How many people would tell me I want to be myself in my role. I want to be authentic [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4015.64s)]
*  I want to bring my real self [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4021.7200000000003s)]
*  But like not my full self but my real self to work because I actually don't think work is the right place for my full [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4023.7200000000003s)]
*  Self I want to be this and then I would ask them great [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4028.12s)]
*  Do you think like you can be yourself with your team and I memorably remember something like oh fuck no [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4030.52s)]
*  Absolutely not I think that tension like that's the point of the book is how do you navigate that tension? [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4036.64s)]
*  How do you perform yourself authentically? [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4043.92s)]
*  While still not performing yourself at all and like how do you post on social media when your team follows you there? [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4047.7599999999998s)]
*  And how do you be transparent? [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4052.88s)]
*  But also if you open the books too much people are gonna see things [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4054.36s)]
*  They're actually not prepared or able to see and how do you think about your career? [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4056.88s)]
*  Like when the ladders that we have climbed no longer exist and the path that our parents or grandparents took has just been like blown up [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4060.96s)]
*  How do you do that? [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4068.52s)]
*  Like those tensions like I hearing that from so many people and in the last couple weeks [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4070.34s)]
*  I've been going back to all the folks I talked to for the book to be like hey so excited [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4075.6400000000003s)]
*  this is coming out can't wait to send you a copy and [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4078.98s)]
*  So many of them wrote back to me like that conversation stuck with me [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4081.8399999999997s)]
*  Like no one had ever really asked like how how does it feel to do this hard thing? [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4085.68s)]
*  And I'll say the final thing that really stuck with me and has been like sort of my mantra [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4090.48s)]
*  for much of the honestly the last eight years [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4094.7599999999998s)]
*  was how many people would tell me I feel like I am doing a hard thing and is [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4097.04s)]
*  It is hard not because I'm personally failing but because like it is fundamentally hard thing [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4103.4s)]
*  Like I am trying to push a rock up a mountain and no matter how strong you are or how high the mountain is [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4108.98s)]
*  It's gonna be hard and I you know [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4113.78s)]
*  We tell this to candidates when they're running for office running for office is hard [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4116.5s)]
*  No matter how good you are. Our job is to make it a little bit easier like around the logistics [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4119.42s)]
*  Leading in this moment in a way that treats people right but also gets the job done is difficult [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4123.94s)]
*  It is also like running for office. So worth it [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4129.1s)]
*  It's so worth it both for me and for you and for all of us as leaders, but also for the people you lead [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4132.5s)]
*  I'm sure that's why one of the reasons that people appreciated the conversations with you and the question so much because [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4137.9s)]
*  Just being asked. Yeah, how are you feeling? [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4144.58s)]
*  How are you doing it? What does it mean to you? Like you don't ever get that question [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4147.78s)]
*  Especially when you're in charge of folks like it's not their job to ask you that question and like your partner or your therapist has probably heard [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4152.54s)]
*  It all more than that [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4158.7s)]
*  So I think it's really [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4160.9s)]
*  Important to take a step back and they really reflect like what kind of leader am I am I living up to the values? [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4162.66s)]
*  I've laid out. Am I prepared to deal with the criticism that I will inevitably get [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4167.42s)]
*  And am I doing this in a way that I can feel good about well [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4172.38s)]
*  All the answers to all those questions when right in the book [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4175.7s)]
*  It comes out May 13th [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4179.0199999999995s)]
*  The book is when we're in charge the next generation's guide to leadership is fantastic book [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4180.48s)]
*  You can preorder it now at cricket comm slash books or anywhere you like to get books Amanda Lippman. Good seeing you [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4184.58s)]
*  Thanks for having me. Bye. Talk to you [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4190.5599999999995s)]
*  That's our show for today before we go. There was [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4192.86s)]
*  One quick breaking news development that we got that we should know what happened [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4196.22s)]
*  Well, we learned the full Chinese proverb which we did we did not apparently have no it is whoever ties the bell on [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4201.3s)]
*  the Tigers neck [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4210.34s)]
*  Has to untie it. Okay, I [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4212.42s)]
*  Say everything I said that makes complete sense that there's a reason that's a proverb and it's it was dumb of me [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4215.0599999999995s)]
*  To even question something that was I assume thousands of years old [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4220.24s)]
*  I mean I could do a five minute thing on who the fuck is tying bells on tigers next [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4223.5599999999995s)]
*  But you know what? We're not gonna do it [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4227.68s)]
*  I know what if we keep talking someone's gonna tell us why that is we have to do another correction [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4228.68s)]
*  So let's get out of here. All right. Thanks Amanda Lippman for joining us. Everyone. Have a great weekend [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4232.44s)]
*  We'll have a new show in your feeds on Tuesday. Bye everyone [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4236.68s)]
*  You [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoI9ggHMFPk&t=4250.12s)]
