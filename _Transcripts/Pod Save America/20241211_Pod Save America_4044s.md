Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Democrats Should Pay Attention To The UHC Murder Reaction and The State of American Healthcare
**Pod Save America:** [December 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU)
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Dan Pfeiffer. And I'm Melissa Murray. As our listeners know well, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=0.0s)]
*  Melissa is the co-host of our excellent legal podcast, Strict Scrutiny, a law professor at NYU [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=4.4s)]
*  and an MSNBC legal analyst. Melissa, it is always great to have you on Pod Save America. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=9.6s)]
*  Thanks for having me back. Really great to be here. Well, you're one of the smartest people I know [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=13.68s)]
*  not just on legal issues, but on all things. And we have plenty to talk about in the legal world. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=17.84s)]
*  And I would say very little of it is good. But let's start with the news because there's a lot [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=21.36s)]
*  out there these days. Before we get into the latest with Trump and his nominees, let's talk [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=25.04s)]
*  about the UnitedHealthcare killing. This story is showing some real staying power, both for [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=28.8s)]
*  predictable reasons. It's a cinematic murder with spooky clues and a mysterious anti-hero. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=32.8s)]
*  I believe a handsome anti-hero also should be said. I think that is a big part of the staying power. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=37.52s)]
*  I mean, he seems attractive to me. I'm very comfortable saying that. But to each their own, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=43.92s)]
*  I would say. Would, yes. Correct. Correct. But also for less predictable ones, namely the way [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=48.8s)]
*  the story has launched a conversation about our for-profit health care system. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=54.56s)]
*  John, John, and Tommy talked about the discourse around the murder on the Tuesday Pod, but that [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=58.56s)]
*  was before we knew anything about the accused killer. Do you have a take on this story and why [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  it's become such a cultural moment? Well, I think for all of the reasons that you all have rehearsed [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=66.72s)]
*  on the Pod, health care sucks. Health care sucks in this country. Obamacare was a huge step forward, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=71.76s)]
*  but it still leaves in place a largely insurance-based system of health care provision, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=78.88s)]
*  which is really difficult for laypeople to navigate even in the best of circumstances. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=83.68s)]
*  And the circumstances of this killing makes clear how many people are just absolutely bedeviled by [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=90.0s)]
*  having to deal with insurance. I'm getting denied insurance coverage for things that they need, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=99.36000000000001s)]
*  whether it's cancer treatment or things for their children, whether children are ill. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=104.80000000000001s)]
*  It's just a really inhumane system. And it has sparked this conversation in the context of a [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=108.88s)]
*  really inhumane murder because it really goes to some kind of experience that obviously feels [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=115.52s)]
*  universal for a lot of people. I really sort of hate the discourse about the discourse. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=123.04s)]
*  I'm going to stipulate at the beginning of this that murder is bad, celebrating murder also bad. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=128.56s)]
*  And the health care system where the bonuses of the CEO and the value of the stock are tied to [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=134.56s)]
*  denying cancer treatments is also quite bad. But I do think that everyone in politics, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=139.76s)]
*  and in particular, Democrats, should take note of the reaction here. And I don't mean the trolliest [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=146.88s)]
*  people online who are saying the most outrageous things and getting, maybe chasing clout or saying [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=153.2s)]
*  things. I just mean the fact that in a time when it's very hard to capture the nation's attention, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=158.88s)]
*  this has done so. And that tells us something about how people feel. And it is tied in a lot [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=163.6s)]
*  of ways to what happened in the election. I think that's exactly right. People are really [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  frustrated. Health care provision is at bottom an economic issue. Individuals are bankrupted [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=174.48s)]
*  by their medical debt. The Biden administration was taking steps to deal with that at the end of [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=180.24s)]
*  the summer. It's a big deal. And I do think the fact that the discourse has shifted now that the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=187.76s)]
*  suspect has been identified and captured and people are actually talking about other things, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  a little more humorous, a little more human, like whether they would put money on his books in prison [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=199.76s)]
*  if he is convicted. And I think that shows people are thinking about this in human terms. I don't [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=205.28s)]
*  think people are discounting that someone has died here or someone who has a family, a wife, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=211.2s)]
*  and children. And this is a tragedy for that family. But I think what some of this discourse [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=216.24s)]
*  is speaking to is that health care provision is an actual tragedy for many more Americans too. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=220.8s)]
*  That's right. And I think it is like health care is at the core of this specific [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=226.24s)]
*  issue. But the reaction to me is more, says a little bit more about how people are pissed [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=231.44s)]
*  at the system. And I define the system broadly. It includes health care companies, includes drug [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=235.52s)]
*  companies, include Wall Street banks. It includes the companies that are price gouging on gas [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=240.08s)]
*  and groceries and eggs and bacon or wherever else. It includes politicians. It includes the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=245.84s)]
*  media. It includes Hollywood. Well, it's an anti-institutionalist movement. That's right. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=250.56s)]
*  And Trump weaponized that in a very cynical and dangerous way. And as Democrats think about our [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=255.12s)]
*  path forward, we have to recognize the moment in which we are existing. It can't be a moment in [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=261.12s)]
*  which we are defending institutions, that we are the protectors of the status quo. It has to be, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=265.44s)]
*  and I think the reaction here is, should suggest to us that we need to be bolder, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=270.64s)]
*  bolder in our messaging, bolder in our response, bolder in our policy prescriptions to speak to [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=274.64s)]
*  that moment. Because if we don't, these are the moments in which historically demagogues [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=279.36s)]
*  and authoritarians have taken power. We've just had that happen here. And so we have to understand [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=283.2s)]
*  this tells us, the reaction to this is not normal. And it tells us that we need something more than [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=289.84s)]
*  a typical response to it. Yeah, I think that's right. And I think one thing that's been really [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=293.52s)]
*  interesting is the discussion over Obamacare in the wake of this. And I'm an older person at [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=298.4s)]
*  this point. So when Obamacare was introduced in 2009 as a policy prescription and then actually [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=304.96s)]
*  enacted, it was actually radical. I think now many years later, yes, we can understand that it was [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=311.91999999999996s)]
*  essentially a kind of reform of the existing system, but that was a really big deal. So I [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=317.84s)]
*  don't want to lose sight of that, but it's been a number of years, it's been decades. It feels like [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=323.2s)]
*  people are on board with Obamacare. Maybe this is the moment to push even further and to think [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=327.84s)]
*  about a system that would address some of the things that even Obamacare cannot. You're exactly [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=333.44s)]
*  right. It's hard for people who were not around in politics or paying attention to politics back [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=339.11999999999995s)]
*  then to understand how radical an idea was. Because the core principle of Obamacare, for as [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=343.12s)]
*  imperfect as the process was to get it done, was that there is a right to affordable health [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=348.64s)]
*  insurance in this country. It did not achieve that for every single person, but that was the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=354.8s)]
*  goal. And the reasons it did in the Supreme Court made it worse by affecting the Medicaid mandate. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  Republican governors made it worse by refusing Medicaid expansion in their states. There were [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=362.96000000000004s)]
*  problems in how the law was written, that's problems in the implementation of it. But it [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=369.68s)]
*  changed the conversation. And now the question is what comes next? And I hope that as a party, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=374.16s)]
*  Democrats engage in that in a bold way. And it's not as simple as Obamacare plus to Medicare for [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=378.72s)]
*  all. There's got to be a broader conversation because everything in the middle. Yeah, I think [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=386.32000000000005s)]
*  that's exactly right. Independent journalist Ken Klippenstein published the shooter's full manifesto, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=391.04s)]
*  which is really more of a memo, I would say. I don't know if you read it, but what did you [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=395.44000000000005s)]
*  make of the decision to publish it versus mainstream media outlets initial refusal to do so? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=398.72s)]
*  I actually had to dig around and find Ken Klippenstein's substack in order to read this, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=403.44s)]
*  which I have to say, I kind of expected more of the media. I don't think you have to glorify it, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=408.71999999999997s)]
*  but it does seem newsworthy to publish it in full. And maybe you can have disclaimers around it, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=413.68s)]
*  sort of explaining its provenance, whether it can be attributed to the suspect, all of those things. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=419.28s)]
*  But it does seem like there is a public interest in having it in full. And I did read it. And I [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=426.08s)]
*  think it accords with this moment where we're talking about what is the average person's [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=432.96s)]
*  experience of health insurance. And here is someone who is really railing against the system and this [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=438.23999999999995s)]
*  institution because he's had apparently a really terrible time. Yeah, I don't really have a super [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=445.52s)]
*  hot take on whether publishing is the right thing or the wrong thing. I am generally of the view [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=451.52s)]
*  that this idea that the mainstream media can serve as gatekeepers to protect people from information [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=456.64s)]
*  is long past because just the words Ken Klippenstein's substack suggests that [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=461.6s)]
*  the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal aren't the arbiters of what [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=466.08000000000004s)]
*  is journalism, what people get. I'm sympathetic to the long held view that publishing these [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=470.88s)]
*  manifestos can inspire copycats. And so everyone can make their own decision about it. But it's [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=475.68s)]
*  just this idea that you're keeping it from the public. I remember thinking about this conversation [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=482.56s)]
*  around the publication of the Steele dossier. Now that we're just fully back in 2017 mode here, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=486.56s)]
*  it's going to get out there. And sometimes maybe it makes sense for [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=494.56s)]
*  larger journalistic institutions who have the capacity to provide context in research with it [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=499.12s)]
*  can do that as opposed to trying to pretend like it doesn't exist. So if anyone wants to read it, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=505.2s)]
*  they're going to be able to read it whether the Washington Post wants them to or not. I don't [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=510.88s)]
*  want you to blame the Post, but any media outlet. I think that's a great point. One of the things I [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=514.8s)]
*  think the mainstream media did very well, for example, with all of the different Trump indictments [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=519.12s)]
*  is to provide a guide to lay readers about how to contextualize and interpret these documents that [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=523.52s)]
*  might feel very unfamiliar to individuals who aren't lawyers. I think there could be a similar [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=531.5999999999999s)]
*  kind of contextualization, as you say, for something like this. There's all this discussion about the [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=537.12s)]
*  Unabomber's manifesto and the alleged suspect's connections to that writing. All of that could be, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=542.96s)]
*  I think, importantly contextualized by journalists, by reporters in ways that [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=549.9200000000001s)]
*  advance the discourse rather than allowing more disinformation to flourish. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=555.2s)]
*  You have expertise. When there's this big debate about Elon Musk is on Twitter saying, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=560.96s)]
*  you're all the media now and Jim Van Hyde of Axios is giving these thundering speeches saying that [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=566.24s)]
*  journalism is a special thing. Journalism is a skill set. Show me. Show your work. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=571.28s)]
*  It's a skill and experience. That's right. Use it. That's your competitive advantage against anyone [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=576.24s)]

*  bunch of clowns turning the cabinet. Okay. This time last week, it seemed like Fox weekend anchor [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=814.72s)]
*  Pete Hegseth was about to follow Matt Gaetz and become the second major Trump nominated withdrawal, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=819.76s)]
*  but the tides have turned. Iowa Senator Joni Ernst, who is a key voice on defense issues, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=824.8000000000001s)]
*  who had been openly skeptical of Hegseth, put out a statement on Monday saying she supports him [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=829.5200000000001s)]
*  for at least for now. And as of today, it looks like Steve Ducey's understudy is on the path [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=833.76s)]
*  becoming the secretary of defense. According to Mark Caputo at the Bulwark, Ernst changed her [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=838.16s)]
*  mind after coming under intense pressure from Trump's mega allies. If Hegseth can get through, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=842.7199999999999s)]
*  despite his inexperience and the reams of stories about his personal failings, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=848.0s)]
*  does this mean that the Senate is basically just going to be a revolving door for all of Trump's [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=851.52s)]
*  nominees? Probably, yes. Probably, yes. You know, I actually said this on Strict Scrutiny and, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=854.64s)]
*  you know, caught a lot of strays for it, but I think the fact that Matt Gaetz sort of bowed out, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=864.24s)]
*  rightly so, and Pam Bondi came in and was just not Matt Gaetz and, you know, people aren't really [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=871.6s)]
*  kicking the tires on that. There's been discussions of how much of a loyalist she has been on what she [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=877.76s)]
*  has done to advance the Trump cause as attorney general of Florida, but not the kind of deep, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=882.64s)]
*  deep digging that you would expect. And I think that's largely because folks are tired. I mean, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=888.88s)]
*  like they are flooding the zone with a lot of stuff. And I think expecting everyone to get like [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=893.52s)]
*  a full and proper vetting that is incredibly skeptical and high quality, I think is just going [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=901.52s)]
*  to be unlikely. And that's really disappointing. I mean, that is what the Senate is supposed to do. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=908.24s)]
*  But as a general matter, the Senate isn't dealing with on a regular basis, nominees of this caliber. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=912.32s)]
*  I mean, like all of them are really, really questionable. And I just don't think that's [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=918.8000000000001s)]
*  business as usual. I will say one thing for Donald Trump that, you know, is worth mentioning. This is [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=923.12s)]
*  a man who rewards loyalty. And, you know, I'm not saying the Democrats should do it, but it's really [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=929.7600000000001s)]
*  interesting to me how the Democrats are always like, who's the best person for this job? Like, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=935.7600000000001s)]
*  you know, meritocracy, where he's just like, who's my guy? Who's been here for me? And who am I [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=939.44s)]
*  going to reward? Like, Harmeet Dhillon to head civil rights in the DOJ. It's not because she has [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=944.72s)]
*  been good on traditional civil rights. It's because she's been a loyalist and she's been good on the [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=951.04s)]
*  Trump administration's vision of civil rights, which is about equal rights for aggrieved, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=956.64s)]
*  outspoken conservatives. And he rewards that. Yeah, I'd say a couple things on this. One, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=962.08s)]
*  you're never going to make money betting on the courage and integrity of Senate Republicans. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=966.8s)]
*  Right. Most of these people are always are going to get through. Damn it. That's how he's going to [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=971.68s)]
*  send my kids to college, Dan. Yes, it is not. It is basically you're in the house always wins in that [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=974.64s)]
*  game. It's like playing slots in Vegas. And so most of the people are always going to get through, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=980.7199999999999s)]
*  no matter how bad. I mean, a bunch of really bad Trump appointees got through last time. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=986.0799999999999s)]
*  Betsy DeVos, Jeff Sessions. Most of them are going to get through here. It would be notable [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=991.04s)]
*  if none of people rarely get voted down. They just generally have to drop out before the process [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=997.76s)]
*  takes. And my imagine is these Republicans feel like they have, you know, they could maybe oppose [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1002.48s)]
*  one or two, maybe. But what's the upside for them? Well, don't you think that journalism is really, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1007.36s)]
*  the Senate really relies on journalism to do a lot of the digging and the surfacing of all the crap [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1014.08s)]
*  so that there is pressure on the nominee to sort of like come to terms with the fact that they are [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1019.76s)]
*  objectively unqualified and not great for this position and bow out. And it just seems like the [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1024.64s)]
*  more stuff that gets surfaced, people are just like digging in and like, like there is no shame. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1030.0s)]
*  Well, this does speak to the diminishing influence of the media in terms of holding at least [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1034.4s)]
*  Republicans accountable. Yeah. The fact that it the fact that the New York Times or CNN or the [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1043.12s)]
*  Washington Post surface some piece, some information about Pete Hegsath or Pam Bondi or someone else [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1048.48s)]
*  is often seen as evidence of their fitness for the job, not the opposite. Because it means, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1055.3600000000001s)]
*  because in this world, those are the bad guys. And Republicans really are defined by their enemies. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1061.1200000000001s)]
*  And if the New York Times is against you and the CNN is against you, that is a, that's validation [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1066.48s)]
*  of your bona fides as opposed to the opposite. Well, do you remember the days when Zoe Baird [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1070.96s)]
*  and Kimba Wood could get like just completely axed simply because they hadn't paid taxes on [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1077.6s)]
*  their nannies? I mean, how quaint does that seem right now? Like that's nothing. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1083.52s)]
*  My former boss, Tom Daschle, who was nominated to be the secretary of human health and human [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1088.1599999999999s)]
*  services, Barack Obama had to drop out because on his, the law firm for which he worked provided [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1093.4399999999998s)]
*  him a free car service as part of his salary. And he did not as part of his benefits package. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1100.56s)]
*  And he did not cite that as income on his taxes. And he was ditched by Democrats. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1105.04s)]
*  Now, what is different here than the Obama age and the Clinton age is that now the, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1112.48s)]
*  the filibuster does not exist for executive appointments. So we had 59 Senate seats back [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1117.44s)]
*  then when Obama was trying to get Daschle through, we would need at least one Republican to do it. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1122.48s)]
*  If you lose a couple of Democrats, your toes, Trump only needs 50 to 53. So the, so like his [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1126.56s)]
*  bar of success is lower, but it seems like most of the people are going to get through. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1132.32s)]
*  Maybe Tulsi Gabbard will be one. And what's interesting, I think what's interesting in the [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1135.6799999999998s)]
*  Ernst thing is that Trump's theory and the theory of his mega allies like Steve Bannon and Charlie [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1139.4399999999998s)]
*  Kirk is that making Ernst publicly embarrass herself sends the message that resistance is futile. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1145.36s)]
*  No, I think that's exactly right. Which is so unfortunate because say what you will about [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1151.36s)]
*  Joni Ernst and there's a lot you could say she has actually been really good about advancing this [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1156.4s)]
*  question of how the military can address and rid itself of sexual violence. And this, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1163.8400000000001s)]
*  this is a terrible stain on that legacy. What's I think is in the important context [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1171.76s)]
*  for Ernst decision is that she is up for reelection in 2026. Yeah. In a state that [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1176.48s)]
*  Donald Trump is won by double digits the last three elections. She is in very little danger [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1181.84s)]
*  absent some cataclysmic change in the political environment to lose reelection to a Democrat. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1188.56s)]
*  It's the primary. She could lose in the primary. And that's what these people are threatening [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1194.1599999999999s)]
*  is that if she opposes Trump, she becomes an anti-Trump person. She becomes this cycles [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1198.6399999999999s)]
*  Jeff Flake or Mitt Romney. She's not going to make it. No, they will find some car dealer [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1204.0s)]
*  in Dubuque and they will run him against her and Donald Trump will come out for him and he'll win. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1209.04s)]
*  And maybe he'll win. Right. Like, you know, Brian, Brian can't suggest otherwise, but [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1214.1599999999999s)]
*  like that, that puts her, that's her only, the only risk to her reelection is in the primary. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1220.08s)]
*  Brian Kemp is also a dude. So she also has a gender problems. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1224.3999999999999s)]
*  Iowa does not, although it has gotten better, a great history of electing women [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1228.3999999999999s)]
*  statewide. The, but I think what is interesting here in the strategy is that Susan Collins and [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1231.92s)]
*  Lisa Murkowski have very different political calculuses than Joni Ernst. They, they are not, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1237.68s)]
*  they're sort of defined as not anti-Trump Murkowski, somewhat anti-Trump, but not pro-Trump. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1244.48s)]
*  Right. Like they're somewhat defined by their opposition to Trump on some things, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1250.88s)]
*  not named Brett Kavanaugh. And then Tom Tillis is up for reelection in a state where Republicans, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1253.76s)]
*  he has more leverage because if they ditch Tom Tillis for the car dealer from. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1259.6000000000001s)]
*  Wilmington. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1265.92s)]
*  From Wilmington, North Carolina, that person could very well lose what Tom Tillis would be [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1266.72s)]
*  favored in that race. Right. Like they, they saw that's that in a, in Iowa, whoever's on the [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1270.56s)]
*  Republican ticket is almost certainly winning in North Carolina. That's less of a guarantee, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1275.44s)]
*  but you know, are, do you think there are some downsides to strategy? The bullying, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1280.24s)]
*  the bullying strategy? No, because it's working. Right. I mean, like this is what they do and, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1283.84s)]
*  and it works. The real question is, would it work for everyone? Like Democrats, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1289.1200000000001s)]
*  sometimes it works, but more often it doesn't, but it seems to work for them. And again, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1295.68s)]
*  I think Trump is a kind of singular figure in the Republican party. And the idea of him against you, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1300.48s)]
*  I think really does inspire fear among some of these sort of rank and file Republicans. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1308.0s)]
*  And they're just loath to step out of line. And I think we're seeing that here. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1314.4s)]
*  Part of the reason why this strategy likely works, although he has little margin for error, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1318.5600000000002s)]
*  because Collins, Murkowski and Mitch McConnell, who's never running for anything again, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1322.72s)]
*  and doesn't exactly love Trump, that puts you at 50 exactly. So then you only have one more to lose. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1328.08s)]
*  And that's, so they're, they're still operating with more, with a little margin. But the reason [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1334.0s)]
*  why it works better than it used to is the only Senate Republican representing a state that [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1337.44s)]
*  Kamala Harris won is Susan Collins. Yeah. And so, yeah, just you have a lot of leverage in this [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1343.1200000000001s)]
*  situation. And most of them are representing states that Donald Trump won by large margins. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1349.84s)]
*  Large margins. Yeah. And so they, they don't feel pressure. They almost no one ever feels pressure [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1354.0s)]
*  from the middle anymore. They only feel it from their ideological flank. On the Republican side, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1360.56s)]
*  we still have a bunch of Democrats who are in battleground states who are in a [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1364.48s)]
*  different situation. That's the way it is with judges too. I mean, the fact that you only need [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1367.6s)]
*  a majority, a simple majority to confirm a judge means that they can advance these really ideological [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1372.56s)]
*  picks and all they have to do is just like shore up their base and they can get people in line [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1378.4s)]
*  because they do have this following in these individual states. And if you go against them, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1382.8000000000002s)]
*  they'll run someone in a primary and you're toast. And I think this partly explains Susan Collins and [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1387.92s)]
*  Brett Kavanaugh entirely, but it was a harbinger, I think, of things to come. There's, I'm sure that [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1393.2800000000002s)]
*  the way in which the Republicans bullied Joan Ernst is probably very frustrating to Democrats [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1398.8000000000002s)]
*  who wish Biden could have done something similar to Joe Manchin. But it doesn't really work that [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1403.6s)]
*  way because Joe Manchin is in a state that Donald Trump had won by nearly 30 points the time before. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1409.1999999999998s)]
*  And so he could easily switch parties, which did actually happen once for this is where I am dating [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1414.0s)]
*  myself. But in the year 2001, George Bush was super pissed at Vermont Senator Jim Jeffords for [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1419.36s)]
*  opposing him on taxes. So they attacked him and in the ultimate pettiness, disinvited him from the [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1427.12s)]
*  White House ceremony honoring the Teacher of the Year who happened to be from Vermont and Jim [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1433.84s)]
*  Jeffords switched parties and gave the majority in the Senate to the Democrats. So it's like, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1437.84s)]
*  I don't think that's going to happen in this case, but there are risks to it. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1441.76s)]
*  Which is sort of why we, why he treats Susan Collins a little bit with kid gloves because [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1445.84s)]
*  not that I think she's going to leave parties, but she has leverage that Joan Ernst does not. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1450.0s)]
*  That was a really great moment. That was truly the fuck around of times, the find out of times. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1454.08s)]
*  And I wish we could see that again. That was good stuff. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1458.8799999999999s)]
*  That was like six months before 9-11. That was probably the last moment of the 90s. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1462.8799999999999s)]
*  Even though we were well into 2001, that was the end of the 90s right there. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1469.6s)]
*  I remember where I was. Someone was like, and Jim Jeffords is going to caucus with the Democrats. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1472.24s)]
*  I know we booked this engagement a long time ago. You've been on our calendar to be on Pod Save [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1479.52s)]
*  America. And I know you were crushed not to be able to come on to talk about the prospect of [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1482.72s)]
*  Matt Gaetz for attorney general, but he does have a consolation prize for you and America. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1486.88s)]
*  Let's take a listen. I could not be more excited to join the One America News family. The best [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1491.84s)]
*  reporting, the best analysis and the most in-depth coverage of the Trump administration is going to [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1497.76s)]
*  come from our team. I've got the sources, I've got the insights, and there is such a spirit of [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1503.1200000000001s)]
*  optimism to unlock the opportunity of America. There's no place that's going to cover it better [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1508.56s)]
*  than One America News. Melissa, how excited are you for Anchorman Matt? [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1514.1599999999999s)]
*  Not very. I will say I didn't realize that's what OANN stood for. I've just been calling it OANN, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1519.52s)]
*  and I didn't realize it was One America News Network. So thank you. That was good information. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1527.04s)]
*  I didn't know, and now I do, and I can't unhear it. But yeah, I actually preferred him better on the [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1533.44s)]
*  Cameo platform. Are you thinking of getting yourself a Matt Gaetz message for some of your [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1539.28s)]
*  Strix co-hosts? Well, Leah Lippman has an upcoming birthday, and I did submit a request. Oh, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1545.1200000000001s)]
*  interesting. I'm unclear if that will be granted, but- Yes, we'll have to find out what's in his [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1553.52s)]
*  OANN contract, I guess. I mean, yeah. But I do think that was a good platform for him. As the [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1558.24s)]
*  ladies on Hysteria said, Cameo is like OnlyFansForGhouls, and I like that. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1566.16s)]
*  That's very good. I think it's probably like, this is ridiculous. He is ridiculous. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1572.56s)]
*  If I were to try to divine some larger point out of Matt Gaetz ending up on OANN at the end of this, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1580.24s)]
*  which we should note is the third tier right-wing pro-Trump network. It is a distant third to Fox [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1587.28s)]
*  and Newsmax, so you are far down the line here. It probably says something about where political power [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1595.12s)]
*  exists in the Republican Party, that he is more likely to build a following and maintain his [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1603.2s)]
*  relevance doing right-wing propaganda than being at a think tank or running for local office or [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1608.3999999999999s)]
*  something else. The consolation prize for being attorney general is News Anchor, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1615.52s)]
*  probably does underscore the idea that, and Gaetz has always understood this, that attention is [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1622.32s)]
*  power in mega politics, so he's looking for attention. Don't count out One American News [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1626.96s)]
*  Network. I think this is actually a very savvy move for them. I think this actually will be [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1632.6399999999999s)]
*  good for them to build their audience. They're making a move to be a player, watch this space. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1636.48s)]
*  I don't say that with any admiration. I genuinely think that's likely to happen. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1642.24s)]
*  I would love to know what he's getting paid for that. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1647.28s)]
*  He's already wealthy. He comes from a wealthy Florida family and he probably doesn't need it, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1650.6399999999999s)]
*  but I'm sure that they are paying him enough to make this worth his while. This is a nine to five. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1656.08s)]
*  I kind of thought they had disappeared because when they were kicked off DirecTV back in the [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1662.1599999999999s)]
*  day, this is another 2017 moment, but I sort of thought, oh, and it was sort of on the downward [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1668.24s)]
*  slope, but maybe this is their comeback. Their comeback is mad. There is a redemption arc here, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1673.6s)]
*  redemption in the loose sense of the word. Again, I say watch this space. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1678.24s)]
*  We will do so. One other Trump appointment I want to get your take on. We learned yesterday [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1683.52s)]
*  evening that the next ambassador to Greece would be none other than Kim Guilfoyle. The appointment [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1687.92s)]
*  comes after a report in the New York Post that Guilfoyle and her fiance, Donald Trump Jr. broke [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1692.64s)]
*  up after several years. I know you like me are a fan of reality TV and this has real Bravo vibes, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1697.2s)]
*  so let me clear out the space and hear your thoughts on Kim Guilfoyle, Greek ambassador. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1703.76s)]
*  I'm so glad you asked this. First of all, why Greece? Was Percy Jackson unavailable? Does she [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1708.16s)]
*  have a connection to Greece? I don't know, but I think you're exactly right. If she is ready, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1715.92s)]
*  this is an amazing Bravo show about a plucky television journalist teetering around Athens [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1721.12s)]
*  in extraordinarily high heels and putting back together the shards of her broken heart after a [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1728.8799999999999s)]
*  tumultuous relationship and breakup. This is going to be fantastic. If she can lean into it, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1735.52s)]
*  you can have her setting up the embassy in Athens, hosting all of these parties, like kebab night. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1741.6s)]
*  It would be fantastic and I would watch. 10 out of 10 would watch. This is a consolation prize. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1748.6399999999999s)]
*  I think they think it's a consolation prize. I'm like, girl, this is your redemption arc. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1757.36s)]
*  This is the best thing that could happen to you. Being ambassador to Greece is a zillion times [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1761.9199999999998s)]
*  better than being Mrs. Donald Trump Jr. I would definitely stipulate that that is probably true. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1767.76s)]
*  This is the Bravo version of the Netflix show, The Diplomat. I also think there's a little bit [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1772.48s)]
*  of hush money here. Who knows? This can go foil. Who knows what she knows? She's been around [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1782.16s)]
*  everything. She was accused of some sketchy, involved in some sketchy fundraising. The best [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1788.4s)]
*  is yet to come. The best is yet to come. This is a woman who went from being married to Gavin [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1792.8000000000002s)]
*  Newsom to almost married to Donald Trump Jr. Who knows what chapter three is here? If you can stick [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1797.44s)]
*  in Greece for a few years. It's only going up. I think they are probably grateful she accepted [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1802.0s)]
*  this job because who knows what she was going to say. We don't need to get into the gossip here, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1806.72s)]
*  but if you read the New York Post report, Donald Trump Jr. has moved on quickly. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1810.56s)]
*  To a younger model. It seems to be an apple not falling far from the tree trait there. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1816.24s)]
*  I think this is great for her. It's probably a better outcome than she deserves. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1824.08s)]
*  That's for sure. Pod Save America is brought to you by ExpressVPN. Have you ever browsed in [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1831.2s)]
*  incognito mode? It's probably not as incognito as you think. Google recently settled a $5 billion [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1835.76s)]
*  lawsuit after being accused of secretly tracking users in incognito mode. Google's defense? [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1841.52s)]
*  Incognito does not mean invisible. In fact, all your online activity is still 100% visible to [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1848.3200000000002s)]

*  has raised pressure on the Biden White House to consider some sort of preemptive pardons for people [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1985.44s)]

*  We've talked about the politics of these pardons on recent pods, but it probably makes sense for [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1994.56s)]
*  us to get thoughts from an actual legal expert. So let's start with the basics. Can a president [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=1998.1599999999999s)]
*  really pardon people for crimes for which they have not been charged? [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2003.36s)]
*  Yes. See Gerald Ford pardoning Richard Nixon. Yes. Very recent example of this. There is a [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2006.8s)]
*  Supreme Court case from 1866 called Ex Parte Gardlin that basically says the president's [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2014.32s)]
*  authority to pardon is unlimited except in cases of impeachment. So you can't just sort of pardon [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2020.0s)]
*  for things for which the president has been impeached, but it can otherwise extend to every [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2026.1599999999999s)]
*  offense known to the law and able to be exercised either before legal proceedings are taken or [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2030.8s)]
*  during the pendency of legal proceedings or after conviction and judgment, which is usually the case. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2035.84s)]
*  But again, Ford pardoned Nixon before Nixon had been formally convicted or formally convicted [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2041.28s)]
*  or even indicted on any crime. And again, it was sort of to clear the air, like end this long [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2048.32s)]
*  national nightmare as Ford said. But there is an example. To be very clear, this question of a [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2053.04s)]
*  preemptive pardon of that sort has never been confirmed or blessed by the United States Supreme [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2059.7599999999998s)]
*  Court. So there may be some question of first impression were this to be challenged. Again, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2066.56s)]
*  the Ford pardon of Nixon was never challenged and did not make it to the court. But there is a lot [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2073.04s)]
*  of case law that suggests that the pardon power is broad, is absolute. The most recent of this [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2078.0s)]
*  case law is the immunity decision from last summer that said as much. So yes, I think Donald Trump [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2083.36s)]
*  could do this. I think Joe Biden could do this. And we'll see what the Supreme Court has to say [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2090.72s)]
*  about it. I imagine it might depend. The court's response might depend on whether a Democratic or [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2095.6s)]
*  Republican president is advancing the- No, no. Don't be so cynical. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2101.92s)]
*  I know. I know. I'm so jaded in my dotage. I want to put a finer point on this. So I'm going to [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2106.64s)]
*  make up an imaginary person for this example. But let's say Biden does a bunch of preemptive [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2114.16s)]
*  pardons for people who worked in his administration, did the things that he asked them to do. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2119.36s)]
*  Did them legally. And then, so it's a blanket pardon. And then we find out a year from now [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2125.52s)]
*  that this imaginary person I just made up embezzled money from the federal government. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2133.2s)]
*  That person could not be prosecuted if it happened during the period of time in which the pardon was [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2138.88s)]
*  issued. I mean, it depends on how the pardon is written, if it's sort of broadly any crimes during [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2142.72s)]
*  this period of time, like the Hunter Biden pardon or example. Yeah, well, I guess if that's the model, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2146.96s)]
*  then that would be true. I think that's a real question. I think that's a real, I mean, obviously [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2151.52s)]
*  that isn't perhaps what the president is contemplating in issuing this pardon to someone [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2155.7599999999998s)]
*  who works for me. I think it's likely to insulate that individual from legal liability going forward [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2161.44s)]
*  for things done in the scope of that person's job. But if the pardon is written broadly, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2167.84s)]
*  it could include these things that fall outside of the perimeter of that person's job. And then I [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2172.0s)]
*  think you definitely have a circumstance where we're teed up for some kind of legal challenge, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2176.8s)]
*  maybe one that even goes to the Supreme Court. But again, the power is absolute until the court [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2181.44s)]
*  says it's not. Given what Trump said on Meet the Press, given the people he's appointing, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2186.8s)]
*  Cash Patel, Pam Bondi, do you think Biden should issue these pardons? Would it be a good idea? And [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2192.0s)]
*  if so, how should he go about doing it? I think there's definitely a case to be made to do it for [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2198.32s)]
*  individuals within the administration, sort of rank and file workers who are not covered by the [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2203.92s)]
*  immunity decision who might likely be prosecuted or targeted by the next administration. I think [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2208.08s)]
*  for some of the more high profile people like Adam Schiff or Liz Cheney, that's a harder question [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2215.12s)]
*  in large part because those individuals don't seem to want pardons, or at least Adam Schiff doesn't, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2221.04s)]
*  because a pardon suggests that the conduct for which you are being pardoned was actually criminal [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2226.16s)]
*  and they don't believe that their actions were criminal. In fact, their actions are not criminal. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2231.52s)]
*  And so, there is a kind of signaling that goes on when one receives a pardon. I mean, think about [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2237.12s)]
*  how we talked about the Roger Stone pardon or Paul Manafort. I think there is some fear that [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2242.96s)]
*  there is a signaling effect in being lumped in with a group of people to whom pardons had been [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2250.48s)]
*  issued would suggest that you are someone who is a criminal and they're not willing to take that step. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2254.96s)]
*  But again, it might actually be something we're thinking about for some of these rank and file [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2260.16s)]
*  people who genuinely were just doing their jobs and are likely to be targeted. Yeah, I've been [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2266.3999999999996s)]
*  really torn on this one. The signaling issue is real. I put myself in the position of what if [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2271.2s)]
*  Donald Trump had issued a bunch of these on the way out the door? Yeah. We would assume all of [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2275.7599999999998s)]
*  that, we assume that was just basically an admission of guilt in all and very well might [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2279.6s)]
*  have been, given the history of the people he pardoned or was likely a pardon in that [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2284.7999999999997s)]
*  hypothetical situation. But then also, it is, I mean, the Cash Patel situation and speaking [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2288.4s)]
*  of nominees who seem to be cruisin' to confirmation is a very dangerous situation. And I mean, you can [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2294.2400000000002s)]
*  speak this better than I can, but when a law enforcement goes digging around, if they want [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2300.8s)]
*  to find a crime to charge, they often can find a crime to charge. What's the saying about [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2307.6s)]
*  indicting a ham sandwich? Yeah, like a grand jury will indict a ham sandwich, like the standard for [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2312.0s)]
*  grand jury indictment is so low that it's very easy. Yeah, I think that's right. And again, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2317.68s)]
*  I know you've talked about the Hunter Biden pardon. Yeah, I want to get your take on that. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2326.08s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, sure. Again, I think it is very likely that there would have been additional targeting [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2331.2799999999997s)]
*  of Hunter Biden in the incoming administration. And so it makes sense. I'm not especially mad [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2338.96s)]
*  President Biden for doing this. I actually think the outcry among Democrats about the Hunter Biden [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2345.92s)]
*  pardon is largely because it speaks to another impulse that Joe Biden has that I think people [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2352.72s)]
*  would like to be really mad about and for whatever reason just cannot. And that's Joe Biden often says [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2361.52s)]
*  he's not going to do things and then over some period of time manages to reconsider and to [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2369.6s)]
*  prioritize his own personal interests in doing something over the principle that he previously [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2376.08s)]
*  stated. And so, you know, Hunter Biden's pardon after Joe Biden expressly disclaimed the prospect [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2381.52s)]
*  of a pardon for him also, I think reflects the way Democrats might feel about the fact that Joe [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2388.56s)]
*  Biden said he was going to be a one term president and a bridge to the future and then ultimately [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2393.52s)]
*  decided to run again when he likely should not have. And, you know, now we are on the precipice [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2398.48s)]
*  of a second Trump administration. I mean, I think that's really what has people mad, not the pardon [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2405.28s)]
*  itself, but this idea that it kind of speaks to a personal proclivity that is just not great and [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2410.2400000000002s)]
*  has actually been harmful in some way. I sort of got through a process of this before the election. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2417.76s)]
*  I was I said to my sort of thought to myself, he should definitely pardon his son, right? That [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2422.08s)]
*  especially I was in my head. It's like Kamala Harris wins. He stepped aside. He did this like [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2426.48s)]
*  let him have like let him have this. Yeah. And then I was when he did it, I was initially mad [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2430.96s)]
*  at the way he did it. I was mad at the timing. I was mad at that. You just sort of mean I broke [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2435.84s)]
*  that news. I was the one on MSNBC, like just filling in for someone after Thanksgiving. And [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2440.2400000000002s)]
*  they're like, by the way, there's some breaking. I'm like, really? Right on a Sunday night without [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2445.44s)]
*  explaining it or defending it. Right. And that put the Democratic Party and his defender, people who [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2450.56s)]
*  wanted to defend and put it in a position because he did not articulate his reason. I thought that [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2456.16s)]
*  was sort of political malpractice. He did issue the statement. Right. But you sort of like in [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2460.24s)]
*  we are this is not you know, 1928, like you got to go on camera and defend it. And right away. He [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2464.3999999999996s)]
*  has paid to the extent that he can pay a political price or there's a poll out this week that shows [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2469.2799999999997s)]
*  that two in 10 Americans support the pardon. When I think that number could be higher if he had gone [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2474.64s)]
*  out and defended it as he wrote in the thing, right? As a president and a father. And I, the [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2479.12s)]
*  more I thought about this, if I was sitting there with the power to keep my son out of prison for a [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2485.36s)]
*  nonviolent crime for which I believed he had been prosecuted for primarily because he was my son, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2490.2400000000002s)]
*  I would do the same thing for my son, my daughter. Like I would have done that. And I think you could [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2496.48s)]
*  probably explain that to people. Maybe that's right. Maybe that's wrong. But the reason why [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2500.6400000000003s)]
*  people are mad, you're right about this. It's a proxy for for and I think this was my initial [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2504.8s)]
*  reaction to it's that people are mad at Biden. Democrats are mad at Biden for the position. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2508.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah. That he put us in this election by running for reelection and then waiting a month [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2515.04s)]
*  after that debate to stay on the rise. Prioritizing his own personal interests [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2519.6800000000003s)]
*  over principle or party. And I'm going to catch strays from all the fans who, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2524.96s)]
*  I do think that's what people are mad about. I think people understand as a father why [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2530.0s)]
*  you would do this. I think people understand that this was like the most uncomfortable Thanksgiving [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2534.4s)]
*  in Nantucket ever with Jill and Hunter like just on him. I think the statement also, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2538.72s)]
*  I think Hunter had something to do with the statement. Not all of that is Joe Biden's voice, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2545.2s)]
*  I think. I think some of that is very clearly coming from the family. But yeah, I mean, [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2550.24s)]
*  I just imagine Joe Biden like that Ben Affleck meme, like on the porch after Thanksgiving, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2556.48s)]
*  furiously smoking because he has been getting it all weekend and yeah, this is the output. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2562.4s)]
*  But I don't think that's why people are mad. And I don't think that's why people don't support [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2568.64s)]
*  this part and it's something bigger. Do you think this is a pardon that could be challenged? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2572.4s)]
*  Again, the Supreme Court has already said that the pardon power is- [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2576.8s)]
*  It's written broadly in a way. It's written very broadly. I mean, it's a 10 year span. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2580.32s)]
*  Yeah, I think it could be challenged, but I think it's unlikely to be challenged. And I think if [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2586.08s)]
*  it were to go to the Supreme Court, I think this is pretty airtight. I think the court would have [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2589.84s)]
*  to really go back on some of its prior precedents talking about pardons, including the immunity [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2595.36s)]
*  decision in order to undo this. It would also be remiss of us not to mention the fact in any [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2603.28s)]
*  conversation about pardons that Joe Biden's going to issue is that Donald Trump has pledged once [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2608.32s)]
*  again to issue pardons for the January 6th writers when he gets into office. I think this is something [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2612.7200000000003s)]
*  Joe Biden really should get on right now, not the January 6th protesters and their pardons, but [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2619.12s)]
*  the clemency power is woefully underutilized by presidents. And there are a lot of people, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2624.48s)]
*  low level drug offenders in federal prison, people who are hemmed up on conspiracy charges, [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2630.96s)]
*  like women who have conspiracy charges because they may have been around while their boyfriend [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2636.4s)]
*  was doing major kingpin stuff. That happens all the time. And there are lots of people in federal [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2640.72s)]
*  prison who could benefit from the kind of rehabilitative and redemptive instinct that has [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2645.28s)]
*  benefited Hunter Biden and will likely benefit these January 6th protesters. And I think this [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2652.48s)]
*  is the moment not just to preemptively pardon those in the administration who are likely to [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2657.44s)]
*  be targeted, but to use the clemency power to meaningfully affect the lives of a lot of other [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2661.44s)]
*  people, many of whom are black and brown. I think one of the reasons, and again, this is just me [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2667.1200000000003s)]
*  riffing, I think one of the reasons that Donald Trump did better than expected with some [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2672.08s)]
*  constituencies, including black men, is that he actually used the pardon power a lot for Kwame [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2678.4s)]
*  Kilpatrick, the embattled mayor of Detroit who had been convicted. I mean, that stuff I think is [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2684.08s)]
*  actually meaningful in communities where the impact of the criminal justice system is deeply [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2690.0s)]
*  and keenly felt. And not to mention he worked with one of the most famous people in the world on many [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2695.7599999999998s)]
*  of those pardons, US pardon attorney Kim Kardashian. It was on multiple episodes. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2701.04s)]
*  Attorney is a generous term for this, but yes. Yeah. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2705.68s)]
*  I mean, there was a lot of coverage in social media. There was her in the White House. It was [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2709.6s)]
*  on literally multiple episodes. It was a season arc on keeping up with the Kardashians. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2713.68s)]
*  That is a meaningful thing that you can do in a community literally scarred by its [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2720.88s)]
*  associations with the criminal justice system. I mean, a redemption story, that could be really [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2727.36s)]
*  important for Democrats going forward. Okay. This is something that has been eating [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2733.2s)]
*  at me since the election. I've been meaning to talk to someone smart about it. I now have you [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2737.84s)]
*  here, so I'm going to use podcast co-host privilege to get into this. But think about it this way, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2742.08s)]
*  and this is a very painful way to look at it. But if there had just been a shift of two points in [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2747.04s)]
*  Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, Donald Trump could very well be headed to a different [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2751.7599999999998s)]
*  prison instead of the White House. Now, it probably seems bizarre to the average American, [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2756.64s)]
*  not that I consider myself the average American, but should winning an election really be a get [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2761.52s)]
*  out of jail free card? So I wanted to go through with you, who is once again an actual expert, [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2766.16s)]
*  what is going to happen with Trump's criminal cases? And I wanted to start with the crimes [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2770.72s)]
*  for which Trump has already been convicted. In the Hush Money trial in Manhattan, [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2773.92s)]
*  and Trump's attorneys are trying to dismiss the conviction, Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg laid out some [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2778.88s)]
*  alternative scenarios, including treating Trump like he's dead. Can you explain to us laypeople [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2784.0s)]
*  what is happening there? Okay. So Alvin Bragg, I want to be really clear about this. Alvin Bragg [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2788.32s)]
*  is standing on business and defending his conviction. So the first thing that he has [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2794.0s)]
*  been very clear about with Justice Marchand is that dismissing this indictment after a trial [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2798.88s)]
*  and a guilty verdict, because the defendant later won an election, would actually damage [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2803.36s)]
*  the judicial system. It would undermine the public's perception that the system is fair, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2809.28s)]
*  because it would be like winning an election is a get out of jail free card. So he has made [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2813.2s)]
*  that argument. Nevertheless, I think there is broad consensus among law school professors, [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2817.7599999999998s)]
*  constitutional law scholars, that you can't have a state criminal prosecution of a president while [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2824.56s)]
*  he's in office for a number of different reasons. Some of this has been fleshed out by the Supreme [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2831.68s)]
*  Court, but in the context of civil cases, but criminal cases where the stakes are just higher. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2835.9199999999996s)]
*  The Paula Jones case? Yes. Clinton versus Jones. And the stakes are just higher in a criminal case. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2841.12s)]
*  So I think there is an argument to be made that while he is president, that can't happen. Now, [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2846.08s)]
*  to be clear, Alvin Bragg has been very straightforward that he is not the president right now. He is the [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2851.6s)]
*  president-elect. There is no immunity for the president-elect. And for that reason, [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2857.92s)]
*  you could have the sentencing happen now in advance of January 20th, and then you could [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2863.84s)]
*  hold the sentence and the fulfillment of it in abeyance until the end of his term. So Alvin Bragg [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2869.92s)]
*  lays out two possible paths for this. So again, one is just suspending the case until Trump's [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2876.1600000000003s)]
*  term is over, like maybe sentencing him now and suspending that, the completion of the sentence [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2883.44s)]
*  until his term in office is over, or alternatively not sentencing him now and holding all of it over [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2888.4s)]
*  until after the completion of his sentence. All of that are possibilities. There's a second option, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2896.4s)]
*  and this goes to your treat him like a dead man point. The prosecutors, and this is kind of an [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2904.1600000000003s)]
*  interesting point, they suggested that Judge Marchand could look to what is known as abatement, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2909.44s)]
*  which is a procedure by which when a defendant dies after a verdict has been issued, but other [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2914.88s)]
*  aspects of the case remain pending, you just sort of abate the prosecution and that preserves the [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2920.8s)]
*  conviction but ends any further proceedings. And I think that's sort of the last best scenario [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2926.5600000000004s)]
*  for Alvin Bragg because it makes clear that this was a sound conviction. It holds as a conviction. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2932.4s)]
*  It just kind of kills everything else, including the sentencing going forward. So he's offered a [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2937.28s)]
*  couple of different paths for Judge, such Justice Marchand. He's actually justice because he's a New [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2942.0s)]
*  York trial court justice. No, I mean, nobody knows. It's kind of vigorous. There was a period [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2947.6s)]
*  of time in my life when I knew that, and I had wiped it from my brain. Well, I mean, as you should. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2954.08s)]
*  But I think, again, that's sort of the TLDR of it. And I think the real bottom line is Alvin Bragg is [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2958.0s)]
*  really working to preserve this verdict and the conviction that flows from it. As he should. It's [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2964.88s)]
*  insane that they would dismiss the conviction because they didn't know he was going to be [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2971.92s)]
*  president when they did it. That's insane. It is insane. That is one of the things that will make [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2974.8s)]
*  zero sense to human beings. He committed a crime, a jury of his peers, heard the evidence, they [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2981.52s)]
*  rendered a verdict, and then afterwards we're like, oh, sorry, guys, we didn't realize how important [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2987.1200000000003s)]
*  he was, so we're going to take that one off the books. That would be insane. And so I certainly [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2992.32s)]
*  hope Justice Marchand or the judges who are here in this do not do that because that is nuts. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=2997.2000000000003s)]
*  Okay. I'm also curious about the Fulton County prosecution. This one sort of got lost in a whole [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3003.84s)]
*  bunch of minutiae and hearings and such, but it is a local, not a federal case. Trump can't fire [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3008.8s)]
*  Fannie Willis or direct her not to prosecute him. What's the latest with that case? Is it possible [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3015.44s)]
*  they could just put it on pause until Trump's out of office? Well, I mean, that case has already been [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3020.32s)]
*  kind of mired in all of this procedural stuff. So you'll recall that Willis had all of those ethics [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3027.52s)]
*  concerns because she had appointed her then boyfriend to be part of the prosecution team. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3034.4s)]
*  She was told by the trial judge that she could stay on the case as long as her boyfriend resigned [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3040.56s)]
*  from it, and that happened. But then a state appeals court was scheduled to review that question [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3046.08s)]
*  of whether or not she could remain on the case. They were scheduled to consider whether she could [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3052.2400000000002s)]
*  do so this month, but they recently canceled that hearing after the election because Donald Trump [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3057.04s)]
*  won and Trump obviously denies wrongdoing here. What happens next, I think, is really unclear. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3063.52s)]
*  If the appeals court decides that Fannie Willis is disqualified and cannot remain on the case, [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3070.08s)]
*  then the prosecution goes to a state board of prosecutors who decide whether or not the case [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3076.96s)]
*  is going to continue. And if it does continue, they'll assign a new prosecutor. This has typically [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3082.8s)]
*  been a scenario where cases go to die. There are currently cases pending, one involving Fannie [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3087.52s)]
*  Willis from which she was disqualified because she had held a fundraiser or participated in a [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3093.84s)]
*  fundraiser for someone who was involved in the case. That case was never staffed up with a [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3098.32s)]
*  prosecutor. It took a very long time for that to be worked out. So that's a place where a delay could [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3103.76s)]
*  be indefinite and the case could be killed entirely or the effort to find a new prosecutor [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3108.72s)]
*  could delay it substantially. Even absent those considerations, there's still the looming question [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3114.8799999999997s)]
*  of the Supreme Court's decision in the immunity case, which does impact the Fannie Willis prosecution [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3121.68s)]
*  because much of that conduct for which Donald Trump and others were indicted occurred while he [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3127.2s)]
*  was president. You have the same kind of questions that attend the Jack Smith prosecutions and the [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3135.04s)]
*  January 6 election interference case. Is this within the scope of the president's duties? Is [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3141.36s)]
*  it in the outside perimeter? What's official? What's unofficial? I just don't have a lot of [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3145.92s)]
*  faith that there's much that's going to happen in that case. Don't circle 2029 on my calendar [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3151.2799999999997s)]
*  as a really fun year to be in Atlanta. I don't think this is... Yeah. I would not [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3157.84s)]
*  buy a ticket to Atlanta necessarily. Okay. All right. For this reason, at least, there are a lot [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3164.88s)]
*  of other good reasons to go to Atlanta. Okay. Special counsel Jack Smith plans to resign before [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3168.2400000000002s)]
*  Trump can fire him. So both the classified documents in January 6 cases, which at the time seemed [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3173.04s)]
*  kind of open and shut before the Supreme Court got involved, will simply disappear forever without [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3179.2000000000003s)]
*  Trump ever facing accountability. What do you make of Smith's decision? Why is he resigning? [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3183.04s)]
*  I think he's going to resign because he otherwise would be fired by Donald Trump on January 20th. So [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3187.28s)]
*  this sort of allows him to step back. He gets out of it. It allows the prosecution to be wound up [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3192.88s)]
*  and perhaps a report to be issued by the DOJ. So there's time to prepare that report. And then for [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3198.88s)]
*  the attorney general to issue it, maybe issue it to the public. I think that might be part of the [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3204.7200000000003s)]
*  calculus here. Those cases were dismissed without prejudice, which means that the judges have made [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3209.6s)]
*  no statement about the merits of the underlying charges or whether the prosecution would have been [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3217.12s)]
*  successful or unsuccessful in establishing their case. So that is something maybe a democratic [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3222.72s)]
*  president could take this up again in the future. Although I think it's highly unlikely. I think if [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3230.3199999999997s)]
*  we get to a democratic president in 2028, I think this country I would hope would be willing to just [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3235.52s)]
*  turn the page on this episode and just be done with it and move on and to something better. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3242.72s)]
*  I know this is just tilting at windmills here, but it is just wild. He's going to get away with [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3249.52s)]
*  all of it. I know. He may face political accountability in the end here. The Republican [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3255.1200000000003s)]
*  Party may end up facing political accountability in the end here, but it's just that you can win [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3260.1600000000003s)]
*  an election and all your crimes go away. Jack Smith seems like to be a man beyond reproach, [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3267.2000000000003s)]
*  but stay on and get fired. Make Trump fire the special counsel. At least get the echo of [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3275.76s)]
*  Watergate. Make him take the action to dismiss the crimes against him. That's what I would do [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3281.1200000000003s)]
*  if I was him. Maybe he's literally winding this up and heading back to the Hague and the hopes that [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3288.4s)]
*  he will not be extradited by Cal. Maybe he is busy packing his boxes to move to a non-extradiction [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3294.1600000000003s)]
*  country. That's exactly right. Maybe that's what he's doing. I guess he does. It's easy for me to [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3300.6400000000003s)]
*  say that I would stay on and get fired when I am not specifically mentioned to my knowledge in [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3304.64s)]
*  Cash Patel's book. Maybe that is what he's doing. I do have to ask because I know Merrick Garland [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3309.44s)]
*  in his time as a judge was revered as one of the all-time greats, but it really feels to me like he [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3320.56s)]
*  really screwed the pooch here. If he had started the January 6 investigation earlier, [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3328.96s)]
*  we could have at least had a resolution before election day. He waited until basically Liz [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3333.6s)]
*  Cheney and Adam Kinzinger bullied him into doing a prosecution here. What is your take on his [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3336.96s)]
*  approach? Has he damaged his legacy here? I think Merrick Garland as a judge was one of the greats. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3340.88s)]
*  He was a great judge in large part because he was deliberative. He was contemplative. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3349.92s)]
*  Those qualities that made him a great judge made him a terrible attorney general for this moment. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3355.68s)]
*  That's unfortunate. I think a different attorney general would have taken a different tack here. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3362.3199999999997s)]
*  The strategy of pursuing the rank-and-file January 6 protesters first and then going up the chain [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3367.2s)]
*  and then starting late on some of those rank-and-file protesters, it was all going [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3375.44s)]
*  to come down to the election. Maybe that was by design. Maybe they felt that this should have [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3380.72s)]
*  been something that was left to the voters to decide and the voters have decided. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3387.12s)]
*  There's also an argument to be made that a different attorney general might have started [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3392.96s)]
*  and gone top down. That would have been a more effective strategy, at least for resolving. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3396.48s)]
*  The one thing that really strikes me as deeply problematic about these cases not getting to [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3401.2799999999997s)]
*  trial is that trials are a mechanism for surfacing and ventilating information to the public. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3406.4s)]
*  I think the public had a right to hear the case against Donald Trump and to judge whether the [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3414.64s)]
*  government had met its burden to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Some would say that [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3422.3199999999997s)]
*  the January 6th special committee did some of that, had a public airing of that, but [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3428.48s)]
*  that is really what a trial is for. I think the public was just served by not having that opportunity. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3434.7999999999997s)]
*  I think when the history of this time is written, Merrick Garland is not going to be covered in glory [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3441.92s)]
*  because he just was not the right person for this moment. To borrow a phrase from the Godfather, [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3450.0s)]
*  he is not a wartime conciliary. I think Biden, to a certain extent, suffers from a similar [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3457.04s)]
*  challenge. They were constitutionally and experientially not prepared for this moment [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3464.8s)]
*  against someone like Donald Trump. They thought he was going to go away on his own. Mitch McConnell [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3471.6800000000003s)]
*  made the same mistake as this. If you can define this period in one thing, it's a bunch of [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3474.96s)]
*  institutionalists making the wrong decisions about or misjudging where politics are going [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3478.7200000000003s)]
*  and suffering catastrophic consequences for it. I think that's a great point. I think they did [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3484.96s)]
*  expect he lost, he's going to tuck his tail between his legs and go off. No, that's not [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3490.0s)]
*  this guy. This guy has another arc in him and we're going to see it now. I also think, [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3495.04s)]
*  and this is in the vein of the institutionalists, Joe Biden was, I think, more principally focused [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3502.88s)]
*  on rebuilding the DOJ as an independent agency. For that, maybe Merrick Garland was the perfect [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3509.28s)]
*  person. The accountability piece probably didn't get attended to. That wasn't top of mind either [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3515.92s)]
*  for the president appointing him nor for the attorney general who would take on the charge. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3523.6s)]
*  The real charge was rebuilding morale in DOJ and making it independent of the White House. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3528.4s)]
*  We'll see how that works going forward. There was an interpretation of the 20, I mean, [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3534.48s)]
*  I could honestly talk about this for years, but there was an interpretation of the 2020 election [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3538.4s)]
*  that it was a validation of norms. It was a rejection of norm breakers and anti-institutionalists. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3543.44s)]
*  I still think back to a conversation we had on this podcast with our very good friend, [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3550.32s)]
*  Jen Psaki, about being press secretary. One of the things that the president Biden said to her is [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3557.28s)]
*  that it was very important that she do the press briefing on a daily basis the way it's always been [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3562.08s)]
*  done. There's always been this discussion about how you change it to make it meet the modern [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3568.16s)]
*  media vibe, but Biden wanted to return to norms. I understand that instinct. It's not wrong, but in [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3571.2s)]
*  hindsight, that's not what that election was about. The DOJ should be independent. I'm not saying it [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3577.04s)]
*  shouldn't be, but there is actual independence and then there was perception of independence. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3586.3199999999997s)]
*  Following the exact normal process where career prosecutors looked at the evidence and then made [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3592.64s)]
*  a decision was not the process that actually happened. What actually happened was a political [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3597.52s)]
*  decision that pursuing Trump would undermine the image of independence. You were never going to [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3604.24s)]
*  convince a lot of people that the Justice Department was actually independent. You just [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3614.24s)]
*  got to do your job the right way, the way it's supposed to be done, and let the consequences [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3618.0s)]
*  fall where they may. It's the same mistake that Jim Comey made with that letter to congressional [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3621.92s)]
*  Republicans at the end of the election. It was trying to appease the unappeasable with the illusion [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3628.32s)]
*  of independence when it is not actually independence. It's actually bias for the purpose of showing [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3634.16s)]
*  independence. I think that's exactly right. That unhinged rant for myself is probably a good place [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3638.7200000000003s)]
*  to end this. I have one more hot take. Can I? Go jump in. Go, go, go. I have been listening to [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3646.56s)]
*  Pots of America regularly since the election. Did you just learn about us? [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3653.92s)]
*  More regularly than usual. I know you're always listening to the Friday pod. You're probably [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3662.88s)]
*  mixing in some love at there periodically. I get it. I get it. Actually, my husband and I [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3669.04s)]
*  binge it on long drives, but we haven't been doing long drives recently. I've actually been [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3672.56s)]
*  doing it while I work out in the morning. I've been watching much more regularly. I usually [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3678.16s)]
*  get you all in two-hour chunks, but now it's like I'm on it. I want to offer just a take. Again, [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3682.16s)]
*  I'm just riffing. I'm not a real political person. I'm a law professor, but it strikes me living in [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3687.92s)]
*  New York City that this election, and I know lots of people have talked about how New York City is [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3694.72s)]
*  drifting to the right, certainly in the outer boroughs. I think that's right. I used to live [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3700.24s)]
*  in Oakland, California. Oakland also had a really interesting election. I think you have said this, [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3704.8799999999997s)]
*  and I think you're exactly right. This election was marked by real anti-incumbency flavor, and I [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3710.0s)]
*  think that's exactly correct. I want to just offer a different slant on it from the perspective of [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3714.56s)]
*  someone who lives in a blue state and has lived in blue cities. I don't think the interest in [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3720.0s)]
*  Trump, even in New York City where people are sort of drifting to the right, is a deep-seated [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3725.6s)]
*  interest in Donald Trump. I do think it is perhaps a referendum on the failures of blue state, blue [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3730.16s)]
*  city governance. I see this in Oakland where they recalled the mayor and where everyone in Oakland [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3737.36s)]
*  knows that you can live in a fancy neighborhood and pay a shit ton of taxes, and you still have [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3744.48s)]
*  to get a private security force to police your neighborhood because the police don't come. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3749.68s)]
*  I think people in New York City feel this way. You are paying a ton of taxes in a blue city, [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3754.0s)]
*  in a blue state, and the services are really negligible. You may not feel comfortable sending [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3759.84s)]
*  your kid to public school, or the public schools are failing in many respects. The services are not [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3765.68s)]
*  what your compatriots around the country receive in their red states. Things like the subway are [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3771.6s)]
*  not unsafe, but they are unpleasant in many respects. The question I think for a lot of [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3779.6s)]
*  people is what is blue city governance? What does progressive governance mean and why should I [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3784.08s)]
*  expand it to the national level? I think that's a challenge that Democrats really need to take up [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3790.72s)]
*  in this moment when they are in the wilderness. How can we make blue state, blue city governance [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3796.24s)]
*  appealing? This is why Jared Polis gets so much airtime because he's managed to make it look [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3802.56s)]
*  really appealing in Colorado. I just don't think it's necessarily appealing in all of these other [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3806.96s)]
*  states. It's not that people are abandoning progressive values. I think they just want [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3812.56s)]
*  government to work better than it does. If the Democratic Party could lean into that, [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3817.44s)]
*  how can we make the Democratic Party be the party of doing shit right and better? [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3823.84s)]
*  It would really go a long way to addressing some of these Trump curious voters who drifted in this [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3831.36s)]
*  election. That's just my personal take. That's not a hot take. That's a great take. Thank you. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3837.7599999999998s)]
*  As someone who rides the subway. Yes. I have a lot of friends who live in San Francisco and [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3843.04s)]
*  Oakland and New York and Chicago, places like that. You hear this all the time. Just disorder. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3850.64s)]
*  It's everything from riding the subway to having to get someone to unlock the anti-shuffling case [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3856.88s)]
*  for your shampoo at CVS. Yes. Dan, did you read that New York Times article about the Chinese [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3864.1600000000003s)]
*  Americans in California who drifted to the right? Yes. If you just expunged any kind of ethnic [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3869.28s)]
*  markers, it was basically about everyone living in Los Angeles and Oakland and San Francisco who [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3876.8s)]
*  are like, I just want the city to work. That was basically the whole argument. I want crime to be [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3882.8s)]
*  dealt with. I don't want the police to be over policing, but I do want them to be doing some [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNBgeRnLjoU&t=3889.04s)]
