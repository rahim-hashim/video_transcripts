Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Trump BETRAYS His Own Voters In New Terrible Republican Bill
**Pod Save America:** [July 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk)
*  Trump is like, what problem should I solve? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=0.0s)]
*  Rich people need more money. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3.24s)]
*  That's the problem he's solving. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=5.74s)]
*  All the things we're talking about in terms of the impacts, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=7.58s)]
*  like the cuts to SNAP benefits, the cuts to Medicaid, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=10.46s)]
*  these work with these owners work requirements, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=13.72s)]
*  that is all a sideshow in order to solve the problem [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=16.12s)]
*  that he has identified as the biggest problem [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=20.5s)]
*  for his signature legislation. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=22.7s)]
*  And that is rich people need to pay lower in taxes. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=24.2s)]
*  Welcome to Potsdam America, I'm Dan Pfeiffer. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=27.86s)]
*  John is off this week, so you're getting an upgrade. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=30.0s)]
*  Our great friend, Jen Psaki, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=32.04s)]
*  host of the Briefing with Jen Psaki on MSNBC, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=33.28s)]
*  former White House press secretary, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=35.6s)]
*  and one of my favorite coworkers ever. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=36.8s)]
*  Jen, thanks for doing this. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=39.08s)]
*  Dan, I don't know that this is an upgrade, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=40.36s)]
*  but you are one of my favorite coworkers ever too. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=42.04s)]
*  And in fact, one of my favorite bosses, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=44.44s)]
*  which I always like to remind you of every time we talk. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=46.36s)]
*  No one would ever believe now that I was ever your boss. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  And even then, that was only, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=52.72s)]
*  that was more on the org chart than in reality. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=53.96s)]
*  We were colleagues, we were partners. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=56.06s)]
*  Okay, we can revise history. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=57.8s)]
*  That's totally fine. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=59.48s)]
*  Yes, that's fine. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=60.32s)]
*  I'm good with that. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=61.16s)]
*  Okay, today we're gonna talk about the big horrible bill, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=61.98s)]
*  which is very likely being signed into law [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=64.32s)]
*  as you're enjoying your 4th of July barbecue. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=66.6s)]
*  We'll also get into the latest on immigration, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=68.72s)]
*  including Trump's threats to denaturalize and deport, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=70.47999999999999s)]
*  Zoran Mondami. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=72.96s)]
*  And we'll be talking with our friend, Rokana, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=74.28s)]
*  one of the smartest people in the House of Representatives [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=76.32s)]
*  about where we go from here. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=78.19999999999999s)]
*  But let's start with the bill, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=80.16s)]
*  because a lot has happened since John and Tommy [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=81.0s)]
*  recorded on Monday afternoon. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=82.92s)]
*  On Thursday afternoon, the House Republicans, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=85.12s)]
*  by the slimmest of margins, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=87.36s)]
*  passed the Senate's version of Trump's [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=88.84s)]
*  so-called big beautiful bill. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=90.48s)]
*  There was some drama along the way. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=92.92s)]
*  Republican deficit hawks and moderate holdouts [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=94.36s)]
*  banded together for a while [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=96.8s)]
*  to keep the bill from coming to the floor. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=98.0s)]
*  But in the end, all but two of them did [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=99.96s)]
*  what Trump-era Republicans do best. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=101.92s)]
*  They folded without getting a single concession [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=103.8s)]
*  of consequence. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=105.9s)]
*  Democrats, for their part, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=107.28s)]
*  did the best they could to delay the final vote. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=108.52s)]
*  Democratic leader, Hakeem Jeffrey, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=111.2s)]
*  spoke for eight and a half hours in opposition to the bill, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=112.64s)]
*  setting a new record for the longest floor speech [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=115.62s)]
*  in modern history. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=117.86s)]
*  But ultimately, it wasn't enough to stop the bill's passage, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=119.14s)]
*  which Trump said he'd signed on Friday morning. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=121.38000000000001s)]
*  Jen, let's talk about how this bill ended up passing. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=124.66000000000001s)]
*  As of last night, it looked like there were enough holdouts [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=127.26s)]
*  to, if not kill it, at least delay the bill's passage. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=129.9s)]
*  I went to bed at 10 o'clock Pacific time last night. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=133.18s)]
*  They were all holding out when I woke up [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=136.5s)]
*  at 4 a.m. Pacific time. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=137.76s)]
*  That all folded. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=139.70000000000002s)]
*  What changed? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=140.70000000000002s)]
*  Why did they cave? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=141.58s)]
*  I had a similar East Coast version of sleep time, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=142.98s)]
*  but when I went to bed, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=146.06s)]
*  or when I was getting ready to go to bed, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=147.38s)]
*  there were still the four holdouts, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=149.22s)]
*  which meant they would have had to flip one, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=150.57999999999998s)]
*  which they clearly did more than that. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=152.22s)]
*  I was thinking about this this morning, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=155.18s)]
*  and I was reading this piece in the New York Times [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=156.78s)]
*  where they had this paragraph or two, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=159.5s)]
*  where it talked about how there was a version [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=161.98s)]
*  of a Republican conga line that came to the White House, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=164.92s)]
*  and Trump signed all of these things, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=168.12s)]
*  and people left the White House after this charm offensive [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=170.66s)]
*  and felt maybe warmer about the bill, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=173.34s)]
*  which that was earlier in the day, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=176.5s)]
*  but I think that continued [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=179.17999999999998s)]
*  throughout the course of the evening, clearly, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=181.45999999999998s)]
*  and Mike Johnson made this calculation, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=183.7s)]
*  which is a calculation he's made in the past, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=185.89999999999998s)]
*  to go to the floor even if you don't know [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=188.45999999999998s)]
*  you have the votes. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=190.84s)]
*  He did it when he was running for leadership, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=191.68s)]
*  and hope the pressure will flip people. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  What happened in the middle of the night? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=197.66s)]
*  Was it a Trump call? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=199.22s)]
*  Was it a promise made to somebody about something [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=200.34s)]
*  we don't entirely know? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=203.38s)]
*  Or was it some of these people made the calculation, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=205.54000000000002s)]
*  they didn't wanna be primaried, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=208.82s)]
*  and they'd rather face the voters in their district? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=210.34s)]
*  That also could have happened. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=212.74s)]
*  It's not surprising. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=215.16s)]
*  I wasn't shocked by it moving forward. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=216.34s)]
*  I'm sure you weren't either. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=218.42000000000002s)]
*  Doesn't mean it's not disappointing. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=219.86s)]
*  It's hugely disappointing, but. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=222.28s)]
*  It's just so wild on one front, right? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=224.38s)]
*  Yes, we get it. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=227.62s)]
*  These guys fold all the time. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=228.46s)]
*  But they all said just hours earlier, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=229.94s)]
*  I will never vote for this bill. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=232.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=233.72s)]
*  If I don't get, I need changes, give me changes. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=234.70000000000002s)]
*  Then they voted for a bill with no changes. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=236.70000000000002s)]
*  Not a single comma period quotation mark number was changed [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=239.06s)]
*  from the Senate bill that arrived earlier that day. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=243.9s)]
*  They just rubber stamped that. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=246.18s)]
*  And I guess, and I talked about this a little bit [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=248.38s)]
*  in my interview with Ro Khanna that you'll hear later, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=250.54000000000002s)]
*  there's a lot of fear of Trump in the primary. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=252.56s)]
*  It's just no one means what they say, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=255.12s)]
*  which maybe that's just like naive to even care about, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=259.18s)]
*  but they don't even adhere to their lies. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=261.88s)]
*  They're lying about what's in the bill. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=265.52s)]
*  And even within the framework of that lie, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=267.6s)]
*  they can't stick to it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=271.08s)]
*  True. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=272.68s)]
*  And remember, there were two different reasons [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=273.52s)]
*  why House members were opposing the bill. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  There was the Freedom Caucus, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=278.64s)]
*  who all were so outraged by the cost, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=281.24s)]
*  or how expensive the bill was, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=284.84000000000003s)]
*  a hugely expensive deficit adding bill. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=286.6s)]
*  They were outraged by that. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=289.96000000000004s)]
*  I'm never gonna support this. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=291.2s)]
*  Some of them were threatening like, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=293.28000000000003s)]
*  we'll walk out, what have you. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=294.68s)]
*  They obviously did it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=296.14s)]
*  Most of them didn't do that. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=297.6s)]
*  And then there were the members who were [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  at least verbally outraged by the Medicaid, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=302.16s)]
*  impact of Medicaid. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=305.94s)]
*  And they just still went ahead and did it. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=308.24s)]
*  So it was like two different groups convinced themselves [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=310.68s)]
*  to come forward and support the bill. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=314.04s)]
*  And who knows what they're telling themselves. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=316.6s)]
*  It may be it's their political survival, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=319.20000000000005s)]
*  but yeah, completely disappointing and outrageous. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=321.06s)]
*  And hopefully they pay a political price. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=324.88s)]
*  They will. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=329.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, the thing that's interesting was, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=330.08000000000004s)]
*  for a long time, there were four no votes, right? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=333.70000000000005s)]
*  Three conservatives and Brian Fitzpatrick, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=336.20000000000005s)]
*  who is a, I can't really call anyone in this caucus [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=338.68s)]
*  moderate, but he represents a vulnerable, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=341.72s)]
*  a swing district. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=344.52s)]
*  Moderate-ish. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=345.36s)]
*  Yeah, he's more moderate than Jim Jordan. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=346.2s)]
*  So congratulations, whatever, right? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=348.88s)]
*  And his vote was mostly somewhat about Medicaid, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=352.2s)]
*  but really also about he's mad about them cutting off arms [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=354.6s)]
*  to Ukraine. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=357.2s)]
*  And he, to his credit, voted no, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=358.92s)]
*  and then turned off his phone and left. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=360.84000000000003s)]
*  I don't know why more people don't do that, by the way. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=362.72s)]
*  Why would people stick around? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=365.36s)]
*  That's like a side note to wait to be pressured [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=367.0s)]
*  by Lil Mike Johnson. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=369.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=370.78s)]
*  It's very strange. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=371.61999999999995s)]
*  But then, so most of the argument, which is just, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=372.46s)]
*  here you have this bill that is going to kick 17, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=376.46s)]
*  we'll get into the details, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=379.02s)]
*  but it's keep you off their healthcare, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=379.85999999999996s)]
*  take food away from poor people, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=380.9s)]
*  do all these terrible things. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=382.08s)]
*  And most of the people opposing it, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=383.65999999999997s)]
*  people who are most likely to bring it down, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=385.14s)]
*  were not mad about any of that stuff. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=386.85999999999996s)]
*  No. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=388.94s)]
*  They were not mad that the bill was too cruel. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=389.78s)]
*  They were mad that it wasn't cruel enough. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=391.17999999999995s)]
*  And just like the total like fucked up nihilistic cruelty [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=392.65999999999997s)]
*  of the Republican party comes to bear in this, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=398.82s)]
*  because their argument was, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=400.3s)]
*  we said we needed a bill with $2 trillion in cuts. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=401.94s)]
*  That's the, their claim was, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=407.90000000000003s)]
*  that's the deal that Mike Johnson made to us. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=409.14s)]
*  That was what was in our budget resolution. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=410.82s)]
*  That's what we passed. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=413.2s)]
*  And then the Senate gets their bill, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=414.58000000000004s)]
*  and they make a bunch of changes. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=416.3s)]
*  They actually make some of the Medicaid stuff worse. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=417.18s)]
*  No one's, almost no one's complaining about that. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=418.8s)]
*  Maybe one guy from North Carolina [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=420.62s)]
*  who ended up voting for the bill. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=422.46000000000004s)]
*  What the Senate did was, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=424.2s)]
*  is they made a bunch of business tax cuts permanent, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=425.18s)]
*  which added a half a trillion dollars to the bill. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=428.70000000000005s)]
*  Made it more expensive, yeah. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=431.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=433.34000000000003s)]
*  So instead of taking those out, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=434.18s)]
*  no one's arguing to take those out. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=435.58000000000004s)]
*  They're just arguing for more Medicaid cuts to do it. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=436.54s)]
*  It's just like we, the opposition, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=438.78000000000003s)]
*  it's just really important for I think, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=441.14000000000004s)]
*  but again, it's most of the opposition [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=442.20000000000005s)]
*  with the Republican party, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=443.38000000000005s)]
*  was not that the bill kicked people off its healthcare, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=444.34000000000003s)]
*  so it didn't kick enough people off its healthcare. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=446.5s)]
*  No, 100%. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=447.94000000000005s)]
*  And the other part that's completely gross, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=449.34000000000003s)]
*  there's many gross parts, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=452.3s)]
*  is that when they talk about this, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=453.8s)]
*  a lot of them explain it as, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=456.02000000000004s)]
*  well we just wanted to extend the tax cuts, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=458.94s)]
*  and the Medicaid stuff is just a pay for. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=460.62s)]
*  It's just a pay for. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=463.74s)]
*  Like it's not a policy decision. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=465.28000000000003s)]
*  It's like, no it is a decision, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=467.48s)]
*  because it's a huge impact of the bill. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=469.06s)]
*  As if it was a sidebar thing, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=471.24s)]
*  they were just trying to find money to cover [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=472.88s)]
*  the tax cuts for the highest income. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=474.98s)]
*  As if that makes it okay. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=477.38s)]
*  Which I find even more disgusting, right? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=479.06s)]
*  It's like. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=482.7s)]
*  Manutia, as JD Vance would call it. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=483.54s)]
*  Which, that as a note, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=484.82s)]
*  and I don't know if you've talked about this, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=486.38s)]
*  but the fact that it wasn't like a reporter [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=489.26s)]
*  caught him in the hallway tired, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=490.42s)]
*  he typed that up, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=492.3s)]
*  or a staffer typed that up, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=493.44s)]
*  and posted it, right? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=495.46s)]
*  It was like, you know what I'm gonna say? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=496.65999999999997s)]
*  The Medicaid cuts is minutia. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=498.42s)]
*  That's what I'm gonna type that up on my phone, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=500.5s)]
*  or whatever he may have done. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=503.02s)]
*  Yeah, all of that together is, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=505.98s)]
*  I mean it should be incredibly alarming for people. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=510.34s)]
*  It should be. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=513.98s)]
*  Yeah, there's something broken in our system, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=515.3s)]
*  because people voted to hurt their own constituents [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=517.0s)]
*  for a bill that's incredibly unpopular, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=521.0s)]
*  and those are supposed to be the circuit breakers [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=522.92s)]
*  in the system that keep people from doing things. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=526.54s)]
*  They're supposed to be under pressure, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=528.28s)]
*  political pressure, to not do terrible things. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=530.28s)]
*  But that traditional political pressure of the voter [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=533.4s)]
*  has been subsumed by pressure from one man, right? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=536.28s)]
*  In the President of the United States. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=540.76s)]
*  And that's when you sort of tip over from democracy [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=541.8s)]
*  into some sort of fascistic authoritarianism, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=545.22s)]
*  because the core idea that the people have the power [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=547.9s)]
*  to democracy has fallen by the wayside, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=551.22s)]
*  because it's really only about one person. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=553.02s)]
*  Very true. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=556.14s)]
*  I know, I mean, you're the polar coaster man, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=557.14s)]
*  so you know more about polls than most people. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=559.6s)]
*  I will say, and you probably saw these, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=562.38s)]
*  there were a couple of polls, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=564.78s)]
*  and we'll see how it plays out, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=566.1800000000001s)]
*  because now Trump's gonna do the big thing [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=567.36s)]
*  with the B-2 bombers, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=569.0s)]
*  and all this kind of stuff happening when he signs it. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=570.14s)]
*  The Washington Post Ipsos poll this week, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=572.6600000000001s)]
*  where it showed that by like a 10 point margin, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=575.9s)]
*  and I can't remember if it was 12 or 13 points, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=578.6999999999999s)]
*  in a different, well, a 10 point margin [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=581.38s)]
*  in white working class voters did not like the bill. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=583.18s)]
*  And by like a 12 or 13 point margin, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=587.18s)]
*  white rural voters didn't like the bill. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=590.0799999999999s)]
*  Those are Trump voters, those are core people. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=592.4399999999999s)]
*  I mean, he won those groups by large margins. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=595.0999999999999s)]
*  What's tricky, there's a lot of tricky things here. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=598.3s)]
*  One of the tricky things is what the Republicans did [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=600.68s)]
*  in this bill is they made the implementation of the cuts, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=602.98s)]
*  not until after the midterm elections. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=606.14s)]
*  So it's going to have to be not you've lost your healthcare, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=608.5600000000001s)]
*  but they are going to take your healthcare away, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=611.88s)]
*  which still could work, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=613.98s)]
*  but it's a little bit more nuanced [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=616.02s)]
*  than like it's leaving next week. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=618.38s)]
*  There's a lot of work to do, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=620.74s)]
*  and we'll get to some of the politics [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=621.58s)]
*  and the communications around it in a minute. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=622.86s)]
*  But when John and Tommy recorded on Monday, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=624.54s)]
*  the bill had not passed the Senate yet, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=628.34s)]
*  so they went through a similar process. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=629.9s)]
*  They recorded, then we're up, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=631.14s)]
*  you know, all the Senate goes into this process [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=632.9399999999999s)]
*  all Monday night, is it going to pass? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=635.26s)]
*  Is it going to pass? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=636.98s)]
*  Lisa Murkowski is holding out. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=637.8199999999999s)]
*  In the end, Lisa Murkowski cuts a specific deal [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=638.98s)]
*  for her state that some people are calling [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=642.52s)]
*  the Kodiak Kickback, which I think is a great term. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=644.14s)]
*  Did you see her defense of why she voted for it? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=647.66s)]
*  And what did you think? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=649.62s)]
*  First of all, it was in the category, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=650.86s)]
*  and she's not the only one. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=652.66s)]
*  There's a lot of people in Trump's cabinet [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=654.14s)]
*  and members of the Republican party [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=655.74s)]
*  who do a similar defense, which is the like, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=656.9s)]
*  I'm an observer of what's happening defense. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=659.3s)]
*  Like, I don't even know what's going on. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=662.14s)]
*  I hope the House fixes it and makes it better. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=664.1s)]
*  It's like, you were the deciding vote in the Senate, ma'am. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=667.46s)]
*  You know, I mean, like, you were the one [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=671.5s)]
*  who just allowed this to move forward. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=673.98s)]
*  But it is almost like they're taking away their own power [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=676.7s)]
*  because they don't want to take responsibility. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=680.9s)]
*  And that is so consistent. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=682.98s)]
*  I found her defense to be so, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=685.16s)]
*  it was agonizing. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=688.98s)]
*  I hope the House makes it better. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=690.2600000000001s)]
*  Almost just offensive to people who she represents. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=693.34s)]
*  I mean, really? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=696.98s)]
*  You have the ability to vote which way you want. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=697.86s)]
*  And I hope that Kodiak Kickback, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=701.46s)]
*  I don't know that it's not gonna solve [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=704.3000000000001s)]
*  all of the other things that are going to impact [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=706.0600000000001s)]
*  the people of your state. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=709.1s)]
*  She, it's just the idea, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=710.6600000000001s)]
*  she thinks her constituents are idiots. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=713.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=715.1800000000001s)]
*  Because she can't possibly be as obtuse [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=716.0200000000001s)]
*  as she's acting here. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=717.1800000000001s)]
*  Everyone knows that it's not coming back from the House. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=718.34s)]
*  But if it were to come back from the House, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=721.7s)]
*  it's not gonna be better on Medicaid. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=723.38s)]
*  No. Right? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=725.46s)]
*  It's the opposite. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=726.3000000000001s)]
*  It goes the opposite direction. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=727.3000000000001s)]
*  The House would make it, if they did it, made it, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=728.72s)]
*  if they made any changes at all, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=731.1s)]
*  it would be to make the Medicaid provisions [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=732.14s)]
*  more onerous on the people of our state. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=733.58s)]
*  And to probably, I would imagine, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=735.14s)]
*  since the state of Alaska has a grand total [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=737.58s)]
*  of one House member, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=740.0600000000001s)]
*  they would have taken out the Kodiak Kickback [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=741.14s)]
*  because that would have offended people everywhere else. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=742.82s)]
*  And it's just, you're exactly right. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=744.4200000000001s)]
*  They are just, people are, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=747.22s)]
*  everyone involved here is so unwilling [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=749.6600000000001s)]
*  to take responsibility for what they have just done [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=751.46s)]
*  to the people of their states or of their districts. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=753.9s)]
*  I know. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=756.0600000000001s)]
*  Also, Lisa Murkowski, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=756.9s)]
*  you've been in the Senate a long time. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=758.14s)]
*  The House is now run by little Mike Johnson, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=760.38s)]
*  who's like, how high should I drum Donald Trump? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=762.86s)]
*  And Marjorie Taylor Greene, depending on the day. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=765.74s)]
*  So like, you think they're gonna make it better? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=767.94s)]
*  I mean, she obviously doesn't. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=770.34s)]
*  It's, again, as you said, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=771.62s)]
*  treating people like they're stupid. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=773.94s)]
*  Do you think Democrats had enough to oppose this bill? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=775.58s)]
*  I think the last, I love what Hakeem Jeffries did. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=778.0200000000001s)]
*  I think it's great. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=782.34s)]
*  I think it brought the vote, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=783.58s)]
*  at least into the light of day. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=788.34s)]
*  Is that gonna make the ultimate difference [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=790.3000000000001s)]
*  around midterm elections? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=792.98s)]
*  No, but I think it was at least [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=794.58s)]
*  a smart tactical thing to do. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=796.1800000000001s)]
*  Leading up to it, you know, I'm not, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=798.86s)]
*  it's hard to envision, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=802.4200000000001s)]
*  now I wanna hear what you think about this, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=804.1400000000001s)]
*  that they could have done anything [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=806.3000000000001s)]
*  to prevent Republicans from going the way of Trump [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=807.3000000000001s)]
*  and getting enough of them. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=811.5400000000001s)]
*  But could they have put more pressure on in districts? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=813.14s)]
*  Could they have spent more money in those places? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=816.0600000000001s)]
*  Could they have done more targeted efforts? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=818.1800000000001s)]
*  Probably, but again, I'm still not totally sure, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=822.5s)]
*  given how willing to cave and spineless this caucus is, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=826.4200000000001s)]
*  it would have changed the outcome, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=830.58s)]
*  just because of who the final votes were. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=832.94s)]
*  But what do you think? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=834.66s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's right. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=835.66s)]
*  So the polling, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=837.62s)]
*  in addition to showing this bill is incredibly unpopular, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=839.54s)]
*  the polling shows that people have not heard a lot about it. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=841.2199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=843.1s)]
*  It just hasn't broken through to people. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=843.9399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=845.5s)]
*  So I think it's, while I am, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=846.3399999999999s)]
*  as people who listen to this podcast know, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=849.02s)]
*  I talk a lot about the media ecosystem [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=850.5s)]
*  and how challenging it is to get attention. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=852.38s)]
*  Democrats obviously did not find a way [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=854.1s)]
*  in this very difficult environment [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=856.06s)]
*  to get enough attention for this bill. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=857.6999999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=860.02s)]
*  I don't know what, like, I don't have a great idea [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=860.86s)]
*  of what's the thing they could have done. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=862.9s)]
*  Anytime in which Trump is bombing Iran [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=864.4200000000001s)]
*  and we have the tariffs and there are... [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=866.4200000000001s)]
*  Alligator Alcatraz. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=869.02s)]
*  I mean, all the freaking things happening. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=870.34s)]
*  He's sending the military to Los Angeles, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=871.82s)]
*  the middle of this. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=874.0600000000001s)]
*  Like, I just don't know what the silver bullet was. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=874.9s)]
*  But if the measure is, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=878.02s)]
*  did you focus the nation's attention on this terrible bill? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=879.5s)]
*  They did not do that. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=882.0600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=882.9s)]
*  I do not think that would have changed [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=883.74s)]
*  the legislative outcome here, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=885.78s)]
*  because the general view, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=887.3000000000001s)]
*  how this has always been in politics is, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=888.94s)]
*  you defeat a bill. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=891.1800000000001s)]
*  When you're in the minority, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=893.74s)]
*  by making the bill so unpopular [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=894.58s)]
*  that the majority thinks it is not [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=896.0200000000001s)]
*  in their interest to pass it. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=897.7s)]
*  This bill is so unpopular, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=899.58s)]
*  it's the most unpopular piece of legislation [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=900.82s)]
*  in the history of modern polling, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=902.38s)]
*  and they still voted for it anyway. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=904.5s)]
*  And almost every single one of them voted for it. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=905.82s)]
*  And so I don't know that they'd gotten [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=907.62s)]
*  a whole bunch more attention. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=909.1800000000001s)]
*  That would have stopped the bill. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=910.5400000000001s)]
*  It may have made it easier to inform, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=911.7s)]
*  to make more people aware of it, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=914.0600000000001s)]
*  which would have driven their numbers down, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=915.7s)]
*  which could help us in the midterms over time. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=916.9000000000001s)]
*  But they just did not have a ton of tools [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=918.82s)]
*  to actually do it, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=921.1400000000001s)]
*  because there is now this, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=922.22s)]
*  the connection between public opinion [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=924.3000000000001s)]
*  and governmental action has been severed [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=925.94s)]
*  in the Republican party. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=927.6600000000001s)]
*  I mean, I feel like we're having a crossover week, Dan. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=929.34s)]
*  I'm really enjoying it. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=931.4200000000001s)]
*  Because I think I asked you this question the other night, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=932.5s)]
*  but now I'm curious what you think now that it's passed, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=935.6600000000001s)]
*  because now it's passed, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=938.4200000000001s)]
*  and I think they had a, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=940.26s)]
*  although it's passed, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=942.38s)]
*  I mean, Jeffrey's doing what he did was good. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=943.38s)]
*  You've seen some sort of like, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=945.38s)]
*  action and excitement among House members [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=947.82s)]
*  who really showed up. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=950.34s)]
*  What do they do now, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=952.4200000000001s)]
*  like this weekend and the next couple of weeks? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=953.1800000000001s)]
*  Because the key thing to your point is it's, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=955.38s)]
*  what is it, 42, 43% only? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=957.7s)]
*  No. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=960.2600000000001s)]
*  And also in every poll you see, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=961.1s)]
*  the more people learn about it, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=963.0200000000001s)]
*  the more they hate it. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=964.4200000000001s)]
*  So it's like, there is huge opportunity [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=965.5s)]
*  in informing people more. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=968.22s)]
*  But what does that look like in this media environment? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=970.82s)]
*  I think there's no easy answer. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=973.74s)]
*  I wanna stipulate that. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=975.62s)]
*  Like I am very sympathetic to all the people [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=976.46s)]
*  who have our former jobs working for all these members. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=978.3000000000001s)]
*  We didn't have TikTok in our age, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=982.26s)]
*  the communications directing. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=984.2199999999999s)]
*  It just was a different world. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=985.9399999999999s)]
*  We can actually get attention [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=987.0999999999999s)]
*  by going to the traditional media. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=989.5s)]
*  Now it's very hard to reach people. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=991.8199999999999s)]
*  And the people who don't know about the bill [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=993.8599999999999s)]
*  are people who either passively consume news [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=994.9s)]
*  or actively avoid political dues. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=998.9399999999999s)]
*  And so reaching those people is very hard. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1000.8199999999999s)]
*  I think what this means is that we're going to [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1003.2199999999999s)]
*  have to talk about it all the time. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1006.9s)]
*  It's even when we're not getting attention about it. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1008.8199999999999s)]
*  We need people with big platforms to talk about it. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1010.42s)]
*  We need the people within the party [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1012.5s)]
*  with the biggest platforms. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1013.8199999999999s)]
*  And that includes our former boss, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1015.38s)]
*  that includes all the people who have inkling [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1017.5s)]
*  of running for president in 2028. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1021.5799999999999s)]
*  It includes the former vice president and our nominee [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1023.74s)]
*  have to be out there talking about this. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1026.82s)]
*  Those people have not really been on the playing field yet. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1029.42s)]
*  And so our biggest megaphones [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1031.86s)]
*  have not been talking about it. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1033.98s)]
*  Because we will win this battle from public opinion [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1035.42s)]
*  the more people know about it. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1037.98s)]
*  Because even just as it's gotten more attention [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1039.1399999999999s)]
*  over the last six weeks here, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1041.62s)]
*  as the house has said and been considering it, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1043.26s)]
*  it has gotten less popular. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1045.3s)]
*  And one thing that I think should give everyone [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1046.4199999999998s)]
*  some confidence in the Navigator Research Polling [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1047.82s)]
*  among Republicans, among Republicans, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1050.5s)]
*  as I said on your show the other night, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1053.98s)]
*  the poll, the bill is 10 points less popular now [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1055.3799999999999s)]
*  than it was six weeks ago. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1058.3s)]
*  And so there is like, if we talk about it, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1060.1s)]
*  we can actually do it, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1062.1s)]
*  but it's gonna have to be more than, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1063.4599999999998s)]
*  it's gonna, we're not gonna, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1065.3s)]
*  there's not gonna be one single thing that does it. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1066.82s)]
*  I think this is one of those times where just like, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1068.5s)]
*  repetition, repetition, repetition, repetition, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1070.42s)]
*  right into the campaign cycle. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1073.06s)]
*  Yeah, and I think the, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1074.9s)]
*  I mean, this reminds me a lot of 2018. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1077.1s)]
*  I don't know if it reminds you of 2018. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1081.34s)]
*  Just because that was a campaign all about healthcare, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1084.42s)]
*  that cycle, that was when Democrats won back a lot of seats, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1090.14s)]
*  won back to have 40 something seats, I think. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1094.38s)]
*  Pelosi became speaker again. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1096.5s)]
*  And it was about Republicans' efforts to take things away. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1099.22s)]
*  And now it's like, they're actually taking things away, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1102.22s)]
*  but it was very focused to your point. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1105.14s)]
*  And again, the media environment was very different then, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1109.18s)]
*  so it's more challenging, but more than, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1111.42s)]
*  I looked this up the other day, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1113.82s)]
*  more than 50% of the ads post-Labor Day [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1114.66s)]
*  were about healthcare. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1118.7s)]
*  I mean, it wasn't about 20 topics, right? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1119.86s)]
*  That's my point. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1122.38s)]
*  And we got a long time till the midterms, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1123.22s)]
*  but it is sort of a modern day lesson in some ways. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1125.02s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1130.22s)]
*  It's like, we were able to, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1131.06s)]
*  with a measure of pretty significant discipline [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1132.54s)]
*  across the party, which was notable in a party [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1134.86s)]
*  that's not always disciplined, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1136.82s)]
*  to really focus on the idea that they were trying, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1138.26s)]
*  that they cut taxes for rich people [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1140.46s)]
*  and were gonna try to pay for it [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1142.3799999999999s)]
*  by taking your healthcare away. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1143.5s)]
*  And that, the slight difference here [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1145.54s)]
*  that I think makes this a little more challenging for us is, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1148.06s)]
*  because of the different media environment, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1150.5s)]
*  because people were so down in the political news back then, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1152.02s)]
*  everyone knew the Republicans tried to take the ACA away [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1155.3799999999999s)]
*  because of the famous moment with John McCain [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1158.9799999999998s)]
*  and the thumbs down. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1163.2199999999998s)]
*  Like that was it, like we still had the capacity [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1164.06s)]
*  for monocultural political moments back then. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1166.06s)]
*  And so there was context. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1168.78s)]
*  So you knew that, so when you saw an ad [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1170.1s)]
*  or heard a politician say they did it, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1172.58s)]
*  you actually knew it happened. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1174.26s)]
*  And the hard part here is most people are not going to know [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1176.34s)]
*  that Republicans voted to take Medicaid away at the outset. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1179.86s)]
*  So when you see the ad or hear the politician [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1183.26s)]
*  who you're instantly skeptical of, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1184.98s)]
*  if you don't have context for that attack, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1186.62s)]
*  you're more likely to dismiss it. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1189.34s)]
*  Which is why the work now matters [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1190.62s)]
*  for when the campaign kicks off. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1193.1s)]
*  Like the goal should very clearly have [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1194.26s)]
*  a baseline measurement of what public awareness is [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1197.3s)]
*  of several provisions of the bill, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1200.7s)]
*  including Medicaid cuts. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1202.74s)]
*  And then where is it six months from now, right? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1204.06s)]
*  Where is it eight months from now [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1207.6599999999999s)]
*  to actually know if we're making gains on that front? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1208.94s)]
*  I realize this is your show and not mine, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1212.06s)]
*  but I do think you're one of the smartest people in politics. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1213.94s)]
*  I'm gonna ask you one more question [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1216.66s)]
*  or we can talk about it. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1217.98s)]
*  Since you framed it that way, yes, go ahead. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1219.22s)]
*  Tell me, you better be smart. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1221.06s)]
*  I've built up what you're gonna say. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1222.54s)]
*  The other thing that I think is challenging [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1225.18s)]
*  in a different way now, and Trump has always been a liar, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1227.42s)]
*  but now it is like everybody's lying, he's lying. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1230.54s)]
*  Like that report the other day, a couple of days ago, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1233.8600000000001s)]
*  about how he privately, in the caucus meeting, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1236.54s)]
*  he said there are three things you can't touch, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1239.82s)]
*  Social Security, one of something else, and Medicaid. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1241.74s)]
*  And it's like- [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1245.22s)]
*  Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, yeah. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1246.06s)]
*  Medicare and Medicaid, yeah. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1247.5s)]
*  And somebody in the room, like a Republican member, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1248.62s)]
*  was like, we are touching Medicaid. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1250.7s)]
*  And it's like, is he lying to himself? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1252.8999999999999s)]
*  He's not a policy wonk, but you have to be basically dead [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1256.58s)]
*  not to see what the cuts are. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1260.46s)]
*  It's like, how do you combat that? [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1263.74s)]
*  Because it is pushing this complete gaslighting [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1265.86s)]
*  into the public, and that's what the Democrats [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1268.8999999999999s)]
*  are fighting against. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1271.1399999999999s)]
*  This is the part where we're gonna need [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1272.4199999999998s)]
*  to use individual stories of people. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1274.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1276.54s)]
*  Right, because if there are, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1277.3799999999999s)]
*  people are gonna be more likely to believe people [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1279.58s)]
*  than politicians always. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1282.26s)]
*  Like if I was working on campaigns for 2026, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1283.7s)]
*  instead of shooting like slickly produced, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1289.58s)]
*  well-lit TV ads of people to camera talking about [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1292.94s)]
*  what these Medicaid cuts are made of, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1297.3400000000001s)]
*  I would have people recording videos, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1298.94s)]
*  vertical videos on their phone. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1301.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1303.02s)]
*  Right, so it looks like a FaceTime call, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1303.8600000000001s)]
*  because that's how people consume information now. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1306.42s)]
*  And the more slickly produced something is, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1309.7s)]
*  the more skeptical they are of it, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1312.06s)]
*  because they don't trust the news, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1313.74s)]
*  they don't trust politicians. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1314.98s)]
*  And so I think we're gonna really need individual people, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1315.94s)]
*  because people don't really trust Donald Trump [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1318.54s)]
*  outside of his base. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1321.26s)]
*  They don't really trust Democrats either, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1322.1399999999999s)]
*  but they might trust someone from their community [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1323.4599999999998s)]
*  talking to it. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1326.1799999999998s)]
*  So that's sort of, I think, how you would have to do it. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1327.02s)]
*  RPs, as we used to call them. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1329.58s)]
*  RP, where it always comes back to the real people. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1331.3799999999999s)]

*  because all of you are gonna be at Fourth of July barbecues. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1510.06s)]
*  You're gonna be with your friends and family. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1512.5s)]
*  That is an opportunity for you to talk to them [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1513.8600000000001s)]
*  about what's in this bill. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1515.5s)]
*  So let's do this. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1517.04s)]
*  17 million people will lose health insurance [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1517.88s)]
*  over the next 10 years. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1519.78s)]
*  More than 300 hospitals will be at serious risk [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1521.1s)]
*  of closing the doors entirely. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1523.66s)]
*  More than 3 million people will lose their food assistance [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1525.46s)]
*  because of new paperwork requirements for SNAP benefits. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1528.06s)]
*  Individual household energy bills will go up by $170 [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1530.66s)]
*  over the next 10 years. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1534.02s)]
*  And more than 800,000 clean energy jobs [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1535.18s)]
*  will be lost by 2030. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1537.42s)]
*  And all of that is to pay for tax cuts [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1538.78s)]
*  that overwhelmingly benefit the ultra wealthy [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1540.82s)]
*  and large corporations. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1542.9s)]
*  Jen, other than gas lighting, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1544.56s)]
*  is there any way the Republicans could actually [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1545.7s)]
*  sell this piece of shit to their constituents? [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1547.22s)]
*  Well, this sort of goes back [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1549.18s)]
*  to what we were just talking about. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1550.26s)]
*  It is the, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1551.5s)]
*  and you can kind of see a preview [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1554.1s)]
*  and it's good to know how they're gonna sell it, right? [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1555.82s)]
*  Or not sell it, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1558.6599999999999s)]
*  how they're gonna talk about it and defend it. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1559.5s)]
*  I mean, they've clearly tried to lead with things [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1561.8799999999999s)]
*  like no tax on tips, right? [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1564.7199999999998s)]
*  Which is not a bad thing. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1566.82s)]
*  I'm not against that. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1568.34s)]
*  But as if that's the driving big thing out of this bill. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1569.4199999999998s)]
*  And the challenge is they have continuously said, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1574.4199999999998s)]
*  there are no cuts to Medicaid here. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1578.1599999999999s)]
*  And you have to explain, right? [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1580.62s)]
*  So it's like you have to explain [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1582.62s)]
*  that they're making it arduous paperwork [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1584.6999999999998s)]
*  that people aren't gonna be able to follow, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1586.9399999999998s)]
*  to fill out and complete. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1588.6599999999999s)]
*  And that's gonna knock a bunch of people off Medicaid. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1590.1799999999998s)]
*  And there's this particular tax cut [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1592.26s)]
*  that helps people be able to pay for Obamacare. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1594.2399999999998s)]
*  It's like, that's a lot to explain. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1596.58s)]
*  So I think people should assume [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1599.58s)]
*  that they're going to try to continue to gaslight people. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1603.1599999999999s)]
*  And the Democrats need to make it as simple as possible. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1606.2199999999998s)]
*  As you've done, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1609.4599999999998s)]
*  I mean, we talked about this the other day. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1610.3s)]
*  It's like, it's gotta be, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1611.44s)]
*  they're getting rid of your healthcare and taking it away [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1612.72s)]
*  so that they can give tax cuts [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1616.56s)]
*  to millionaires and billionaires, right? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1617.88s)]
*  It's like, if you're explaining arduous paperwork, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1619.24s)]
*  you're losing. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1621.3200000000002s)]
*  But I think there should be an assumption, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1623.24s)]
*  not to be dark on July, in July, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1624.88s)]
*  on the birth of the country, whatever. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1627.76s)]
*  But like, you should assume they are going to gaslight people [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1629.9s)]
*  and they will lie. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1633.76s)]
*  And so it's like being prepared for that. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1635.28s)]
*  Yeah, I do wanna, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1638.3s)]
*  I started thinking about this in a couple of ways. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1640.3799999999999s)]
*  There's like one, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1641.98s)]
*  what does a politician say on the stump or goes to the grad? [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1642.82s)]
*  How do they say that? [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1645.54s)]
*  Then there is like, how do people who, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1646.98s)]
*  like regular activists, volunteers, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1650.68s)]
*  people who just care about democracy, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1653.46s)]
*  talk about this stuff in conversations [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1654.98s)]
*  with their friends and family? [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1657.5s)]
*  Because my operating theory of politics [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1658.34s)]
*  is that those conversations are now [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1659.9199999999998s)]
*  the forefront of what, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1661.82s)]
*  they're the forefront of political communications, right? [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1663.12s)]
*  What you and I used to do by like dialing up reporters [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1664.86s)]
*  and getting stories in the New York Times. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1668.4199999999998s)]
*  Now, what really happens is you tell people [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1670.4199999999998s)]
*  how to talk about these things [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1672.54s)]
*  and they go talk about them. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1673.36s)]
*  And I just wanna make one point on Medicaid. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1674.3799999999999s)]
*  This is where the gaslighting has been incredible. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1676.86s)]
*  It's all about work requirements. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1679.58s)]
*  And the idea that the Republicans are selling [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1681.1s)]
*  is that there are a bunch of able-bodied people [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1684.1799999999998s)]
*  who are sitting at home collecting Medicaid checks. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1687.02s)]
*  And that is not true. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1691.58s)]
*  But let me just explain how we know that's not true. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1693.78s)]
*  No one gets a Medicaid check. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1695.78s)]
*  Medicaid does not mail a check to you. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1698.3s)]
*  If you are eligible for Medicaid, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1701.3799999999999s)]
*  you go to the doctor, you go to the hospital, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1702.98s)]
*  you get a cancer treatment, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1705.26s)]
*  you see a doctor about a broken arm, whatever it is, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1706.74s)]
*  Medicaid pays the bill. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1712.3799999999999s)]
*  So the only way we're saving money on Medicaid [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1714.62s)]
*  is not to stop sending Medicaid checks [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1718.18s)]
*  to people who don't need them. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1722.34s)]
*  It is people not getting healthcare. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1724.02s)]
*  Or making these people pay for healthcare themselves, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1728.22s)]
*  which many of them can't do [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1730.1999999999998s)]
*  because they qualify for Medicaid. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1731.26s)]
*  And on the work requirement thing, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1734.5s)]
*  that is the one part in the polling that polls very well. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1736.12s)]
*  Just we have to, one just factual point here [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1739.1799999999998s)]
*  is that the point of these, Arkansas did this. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1741.9399999999998s)]
*  When Arkansas put work requirements on Medicaid, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1746.22s)]
*  employment did not go up. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1749.6999999999998s)]
*  Ezra Klein and Maddie Glacius made this point [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1752.3799999999999s)]
*  on their podcast. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1753.9399999999998s)]
*  Didn't prompt people to go back to work [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1754.78s)]
*  or whatever they were describing. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1756.5s)]
*  Because there were not people who were being lazy. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1757.6999999999998s)]
*  It doesn't solve your problem to not get a paycheck [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1762.34s)]
*  if you were just going to the doctor when you're sick. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1766.4599999999998s)]
*  Like it doesn't, this is not that, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1768.9399999999998s)]
*  like they're trying to treat this [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1770.78s)]
*  like Ronald Reagan's mythical, pretty racist idea [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1771.62s)]
*  of welfare queens just sitting at home [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1774.3799999999999s)]
*  collecting welfare checks. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1776.1s)]
*  That's not what this is. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1777.8999999999999s)]
*  It's about keeping people from going to healthcare. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1778.8999999999999s)]
*  But in Arkansas, I think the number is 95% of the people [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1779.98s)]
*  who fell out of the program [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1784.06s)]
*  because of the work requirements already had jobs. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1785.7s)]
*  They were paperworked out of their own healthcare [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1789.14s)]
*  because you have to fill it out once, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1791.1s)]
*  whatever it is, depending on the state, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1793.42s)]
*  once a week, once a month, once every six months. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1794.8600000000001s)]
*  And people, they fill out the wrong form. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1796.78s)]
*  They don't fill it out on time [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1799.3s)]
*  and they lose their healthcare. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1800.14s)]
*  So we're just keeping people from having healthcare. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1801.06s)]
*  I think just, if you're talking about Medicaid with people, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1802.9s)]
*  people are gonna use this work requirement thing [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1805.66s)]
*  and I just want people to have the information [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1807.54s)]
*  to actually talk about it in a way that persuades people. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1810.02s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1813.06s)]
*  And I think the separation of how people talk about it [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1813.8999999999999s)]
*  with their friends and neighbors, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1817.54s)]
*  which is the most important question [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1818.7s)]
*  versus what people say on the stump [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1821.02s)]
*  is a really important one. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1822.86s)]
*  Georgia is another example of this [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1824.26s)]
*  where they put work requirements in, it did not work [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1826.18s)]
*  in the same way it didn't work in Arkansas. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1829.34s)]
*  I don't even think they're doing it anymore. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1831.5s)]
*  Or it was like stopped by some courts. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1833.3799999999999s)]
*  Which tells you kind of a whole lot [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1836.3s)]
*  about the absurdity of using that [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1839.6599999999999s)]
*  as the baseline of your program. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1842.1399999999999s)]
*  All right, then, as if that wasn't bad enough, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1844.1799999999998s)]
*  there's the question of deficits. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1845.98s)]
*  This is something Republicans love to say they care a lot [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1847.6599999999999s)]
*  about. They're very pearl-clutchy about it, yes. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1849.74s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1851.26s)]
*  It usually sounds something like this. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1852.1s)]
*  Let's take a listen. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1853.1799999999998s)]
*  The number one threat to our nation right now is our debt. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1854.1s)]
*  It's not China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea, it's the debt. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1858.54s)]
*  You know, America's still the greatest country in the world, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1861.4599999999998s)]
*  but it won't be for much longer [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1863.58s)]
*  if we don't solve the debt problem we have. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1864.98s)]
*  If we don't get our debt in order, we're less safe. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1866.98s)]
*  The national security risk we have right now [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1869.42s)]
*  is our national debt. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1871.5s)]
*  Our national debt is larger than the gross domestic product. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1872.66s)]
*  We're going broke. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1875.98s)]
*  And I think the American people are looking [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1877.66s)]
*  for adult leadership. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1879.78s)]
*  They're looking for leaders to come to Washington, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1881.02s)]
*  roll up their sleeves, and stop spending money we don't have. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1884.94s)]
*  Is that the soothing, soothing tones of Ted Cruz? [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1888.98s)]
*  Yes, exactly. Just always. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1892.02s)]
*  He's on a chalkboard. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1893.66s)]
*  I mean, he is annoying in audio, he's annoying in video, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1894.8200000000002s)]
*  he's annoying in real life. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1897.7s)]
*  2D, three day in every way is annoying. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1899.1000000000001s)]
*  Most of these people you heard there just voted for a bill [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1901.7s)]
*  that Congress's own accounting pros say will add more than [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1904.46s)]
*  $3 trillion to the deficit for no reason, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1906.9s)]
*  and they're all celebrating. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1910.22s)]
*  Were these people full of shit then, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1911.94s)]
*  or are they full of shit now? [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1913.22s)]
*  I mean, both. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1914.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, both. It's always both, yes. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1916.46s)]
*  It's always both. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1918.38s)]
*  You know, one of my colleagues, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1920.66s)]
*  do you know who Steve Benin is? He's very smart. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1923.18s)]
*  I do. He writes a lot. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1924.9s)]
*  He's great. He wrote this thing this morning that I appreciated, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1925.98s)]
*  I think you would, from working in government so much. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1930.14s)]
*  It's like, what are you trying to solve when you do your signature? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1932.3400000000001s)]
*  Most presidents are like, what problem can I solve? [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1935.94s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. I ran on the problem to solve it, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1938.8200000000002s)]
*  or I entered government and it was, I inherited a problem, right? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1941.3000000000002s)]
*  Barack Obama inherited a financial crisis. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1946.38s)]
*  He also was concerned about the millions of people [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1948.98s)]
*  who didn't have healthcare. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1951.1000000000001s)]
*  Let's go solve those problems, right? [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1952.42s)]
*  And that is what he focused on, which is a very clear objective. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1954.5800000000002s)]
*  Joe Biden, you know, he inherited COVID. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1958.18s)]
*  I mean, it's not like Trump created it, but you know, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1960.7s)]
*  it's like he was in the middle of a crisis. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1962.9s)]
*  It's like the most framing thing to me in some ways is like, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1964.98s)]
*  Trump is like, what problem should I solve? [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1969.0600000000002s)]
*  Rich people need more money. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1972.38s)]
*  That's the problem he's solving. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1974.8600000000001s)]
*  All the things we're talking about in terms of the impacts, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1976.74s)]
*  like the cuts to SNAP benefits, the cuts to Medicaid, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1979.6599999999999s)]
*  these work with these owners work requirements. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1982.8999999999999s)]
*  That is all a sideshow in order to solve the problem [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1985.3s)]
*  that he has identified as the biggest problem [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1989.6999999999998s)]
*  for his signature legislation. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1991.86s)]
*  And that is rich people need to pay lower in taxes, you know? [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1993.4199999999998s)]
*  These people keep saying to your point of gaslighting [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=1997.86s)]
*  that the deficit is not going to go up. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2000.6599999999999s)]
*  Scott Besson has said that we're going to grow our way out of this, right? [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2002.5s)]
*  Because if the economy grows, you get more tax revenues, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2004.9799999999998s)]
*  and therefore the deficit comes down. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2007.54s)]
*  But here's the thing, right? [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2009.54s)]
*  This is a very important point. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2010.74s)]
*  One, it's BS. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2012.7s)]
*  It didn't work last time. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2013.54s)]
*  Nope. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2014.82s)]
*  Or any time. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2015.34s)]
*  Republicans use an accounting trick that they love to use [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2016.86s)]
*  called dynamic scoring. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2019.74s)]
*  This is getting very nerdy, which I know you appreciate. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2020.7s)]
*  I love it. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2022.62s)]
*  I love it. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2023.1s)]
*  Dynamic scoring is one way in which the Congressional Budget [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2023.62s)]
*  Office, the bean counters, are supposed to factor future growth into it. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2027.42s)]
*  So if something grows, they project it's going to grow the economy 3% [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2031.3s)]
*  or whatever else, they will then take the new additional tax revenue [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2034.98s)]
*  that will come from that and subtract out the cost of the bill, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2039.42s)]
*  making it cheaper. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2042.1000000000001s)]
*  Well, guess what? [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2043.22s)]
*  They finally got to use dynamic scoring here, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2044.1000000000001s)]
*  and it made the bill more expensive because they believe this bill, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2047.02s)]
*  the CBO believes this bill is going to slow down growth because it's [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2050.78s)]
*  going to raise interest rates. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2053.46s)]
*  And so is it like it's going to make it worse? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2055.14s)]
*  And just this idea, like you and I were around when Washington DC [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2057.54s)]
*  lost its mind about debt and deficit and thought [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2062.42s)]
*  we were going to become Greece and all of this, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2065.54s)]
*  at the exact moment when the government was trying to get out [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2067.66s)]
*  of a financial crisis, we're trying to create jobs, [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2070.74s)]
*  and all of a sudden we're worried about deficits, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2072.74s)]
*  that was a time when interest rates were close to zero. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2074.8599999999997s)]
*  Now we're at a time of inflation. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2077.7s)]
*  Interest rates are high. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2079.06s)]
*  So the cost of that $3 trillion is massively more expensive [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2080.2599999999998s)]
*  than it was when Obama passed the Recovery Act, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2083.8599999999997s)]
*  when Biden and Trump passed the COVID rescue bills. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2088.1s)]
*  And so this is going to have real, real consequences. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2091.8199999999997s)]
*  And so I guess my political question is, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2096.14s)]
*  do you think people care about deficits, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2098.62s)]
*  and should Democrats make this a part of their message? [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2100.18s)]
*  First of all, somewhere Brian Deese and Jason Furman's hearts [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2102.94s)]
*  are singing because of your explanation of that, I will just say. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2106.98s)]
*  I don't think the Democrats should make this about deficits. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2112.9s)]
*  Every poll I've seen, but you tell me polls are imperfect, I know, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2117.14s)]
*  does not rank that as the high thing. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2121.06s)]
*  I think it can distract from the other pieces, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2123.7s)]
*  which is like, what are you taking away from people's lives? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2126.58s)]
*  Healthcare, benefits, nutrition, things like that. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2130.22s)]
*  Where I do think there's maybe opportunity [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2134.46s)]
*  is like the hypocrisy piece, I suppose, right? [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2137.02s)]
*  Like this person, and there are certain districts [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2140.02s)]
*  where this may work, so maybe it's district to district, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2142.54s)]
*  but that's my gut, but you may not agree with me, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2146.1s)]
*  which is always interesting. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2148.06s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2149.5s)]
*  I want to ask this question because I am workshopping [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2151.06s)]
*  this in my head. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2153.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2154.46s)]
*  Like, no question taking food and health care away from people [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2155.98s)]
*  is top of the list, right? [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2159.98s)]
*  No question. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2162.02s)]
*  There are voters who care about this. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2163.06s)]
*  There's like, it came up, it would show up in polling [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2164.9s)]
*  in the 2024 election in some way to perform. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2167.78s)]
*  And so there's at least some segment of voters [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2171.02s)]
*  where we should be making that message to, right? [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2173.7400000000002s)]
*  And I think there was some benefit in branding [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2175.98s)]
*  the Republicans as fiscally irresponsible, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2177.86s)]
*  as we were able to do to the Republicans in the George W. Bush [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2179.66s)]
*  era when they were, because Clinton, I mean, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2182.74s)]
*  now we're headed down memory lane here, but Bill Clinton, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2185.8599999999997s)]
*  and then in the 90s actually got us out of deficit, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2187.7799999999997s)]
*  got us in a surplus. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2189.7s)]
*  George W. Bush then spent all of that surplus on a tax cut [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2191.02s)]
*  for the mostly benefit the rich, and then on a really stupid [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2194.58s)]
*  war in Iraq for a very long time, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2197.4599999999996s)]
*  and then we Obama inherited these huge deficits. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2198.9399999999996s)]
*  So I think there's some benefit in branding [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2202.54s)]
*  the Republicans as such. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2205.7s)]
*  I also think that there's going to be massive consequences [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2206.7799999999997s)]
*  down the line for debt this large, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2211.18s)]
*  with interest rates this high. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2214.4199999999996s)]
*  And it's important that people know who did this. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2216.02s)]
*  So that's maybe more of a little bit of a long game [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2218.1s)]
*  because the next Democratic president, hopefully in 2029, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2220.22s)]
*  is going to inherit a gigantic shit share because of this. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2224.8199999999997s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2228.06s)]
*  Well, I wonder, because in the polling, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2229.2599999999998s)]
*  is it who cares about it most? [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2232.5s)]
*  Is it age specific? [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2234.14s)]
*  Is it like independence or is it geographic? [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2235.66s)]
*  I don't know, I'm just curious. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2241.1000000000004s)]
*  I'd have to dig deeper. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2242.6600000000003s)]
*  It has traditionally been [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2243.6200000000003s)]
*  self-identifying moderates and independents. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2246.9s)]
*  And a lot of times it comes from like a pox [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2248.78s)]
*  on both your house's views of the parties. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2250.34s)]
*  Whereas they spend money. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2253.78s)]
*  We have gotten a lot of those former deficit voters [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2256.6200000000003s)]
*  just because I think they were probably more traditional [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2258.9s)]
*  college educated suburban voters [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2262.54s)]
*  who've come to our coalition, but there are some. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2263.82s)]
*  And I just think it's one thing [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2267.2200000000003s)]
*  we should just like think about. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2268.1000000000004s)]
*  There's like a fine line. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2269.54s)]
*  You don't want to embrace the austerity politics [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2270.38s)]
*  that we don't like so that when we actually get in office, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2272.18s)]
*  because we do things responsibly. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2275.62s)]
*  Inflation Reduction Act paid for. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2277.7s)]
*  The Affordable Care Act paid for. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2279.74s)]
*  But you don't want to like, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2282.62s)]
*  people lost their minds about this before [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2284.3s)]
*  and we don't lose their minds again. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2285.7s)]
*  But I do think Republicans have to own this. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2286.58s)]
*  And I think there's probably some value in that. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2288.74s)]
*  But like I said, I'm workshopping it. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2290.5s)]
*  No, no, no, it's interesting. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2292.26s)]
*  I mean, we'll also see because it's like, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2293.38s)]
*  Abigail Spanberger, who's more on the moderate side [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2296.66s)]
*  running to be governor of my state. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2299.18s)]
*  There's a Michigan primary and the Democratic side. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2301.22s)]
*  Like some of these things are going to be workshopped [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2303.8199999999997s)]
*  also in these races, [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2305.9s)]
*  which will be kind of interesting to see too. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2307.2599999999998s)]
*  And I'm also wondering about if there are things [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2309.42s)]
*  like you're saddling your grandchildren with debt. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2311.2599999999998s)]
*  You know, it's like, who are the, so I don't know. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2314.18s)]
*  I'm interested in the outcome of your workshop. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2316.74s)]
*  I don't know if there's going to be a podcast on that, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2318.8599999999997s)]
*  but we'll listen. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2320.74s)]
*  If there's a silver lining here, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2322.06s)]
*  it's that retaking the house, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2323.7s)]
*  which already seemed to be somewhat in sight [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2324.94s)]
*  now seems even more plausible. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2326.8599999999997s)]
*  We've both worked in wave elections [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2328.82s)]
*  that tend to be about one really big issue [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2330.2200000000003s)]
*  driving public opinion around the country. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2332.82s)]
*  You mentioned what 2018 was about. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2334.1800000000003s)]
*  Republicans took the house in 2010 [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2336.5s)]
*  around the Affordable Care Act. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2339.94s)]
*  When you were at the [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2342.02s)]
*  Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2006, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2343.26s)]
*  it was about the Iraq War. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2345.3s)]
*  Do you think this bill could qualify [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2346.94s)]
*  as one of those issues that drives the election? [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2348.3s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2350.94s)]
*  Because I think that if you look district by district, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2352.46s)]
*  and I know there's lots of data [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2357.66s)]
*  and lots of groups are wisely pulling this data out there, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2358.98s)]
*  you can tell the story of the direct impact. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2362.18s)]
*  I mean, David Valdello has like the highest percentage [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2365.82s)]
*  of Medicaid recipients in the country, right? [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2369.58s)]
*  That alone is an argument in that district. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2374.78s)]
*  And there are ways to, and this is like the D-triple-C days, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2378.9s)]
*  it's like make it very localized and specific [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2382.5s)]
*  and about real people and the people [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2385.62s)]
*  that it's impacting. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2388.34s)]
*  And it's about taking something away. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2389.1800000000003s)]
*  So I think it could be, I mean, it is 18, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2391.2200000000003s)]
*  are we 18 months, six? [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2395.46s)]
*  Yeah, basically about. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2397.1s)]
*  I don't know, I'm not a mathematician. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2397.94s)]
*  We're more than a year. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2398.76s)]
*  We're more than a year. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2399.6s)]
*  I'm not a math expert. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2400.44s)]
*  But like, we're more than a year, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2401.42s)]
*  almost a year and a half away. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2403.2200000000003s)]
*  Lots of things could happen, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2404.26s)]
*  but I still think this could be the like defining topic [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2405.86s)]
*  that is hammered home in a lot of these districts, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2411.34s)]
*  at least in putting challengers on the map [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2413.98s)]
*  in some ways too, [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2416.3s)]
*  who are running against people who voted for this, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2417.98s)]
*  but that's just my gut. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2420.88s)]
*  Yeah, I think this should make winning the house easier. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2422.98s)]
*  It should even make winning the Senate plausible [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2426.02s)]
*  because Republicans just, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2429.26s)]
*  they launched a full frontal assault [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2431.3s)]
*  on the core of their coalition, right? [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2434.54s)]
*  This is the working class voters [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2437.5800000000004s)]
*  who are gonna suffer from this bill are their voters now. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2440.2200000000003s)]
*  And it's not just, this is not, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2444.7799999999997s)]
*  there's a lot of like, when are the, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2446.7799999999997s)]
*  you see this a lot of thing you see on Twitter [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2448.2599999999998s)]
*  or Blue Sky from Democrats, [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2451.2999999999997s)]
*  like when are the MAGA base gonna realize [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2452.66s)]
*  that Trump is fucking them over? [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2455.22s)]
*  It's like, no, they're the MAGA base, right? [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2457.22s)]
*  They're for him for a reason. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2458.9399999999996s)]
*  They're buying his merch. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2460.06s)]
*  They're buying alligator Alcatraz hats, I don't know. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2461.3799999999997s)]
*  They're not gonna take off their alligator Alcatraz hat, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2463.5s)]
*  their Gulf of America hat, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2465.8599999999997s)]
*  but the people who are really like, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2467.58s)]
*  and they will suffer in this [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2469.8999999999996s)]
*  and they will probably find a way to rationalize it [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2471.1s)]
*  because maybe they care about something more [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2472.7s)]
*  than their own personal financial interests, right? [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2474.82s)]
*  Maybe it's abortion or just general, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2475.66s)]
*  they fetishize fascism. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2479.58s)]
*  I don't know, whatever it is that gets them there, [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2480.86s)]
*  but the people who moved from like Biden to Trump [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2482.62s)]
*  from 2020, 2024, or the people who did not vote 2020, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2487.54s)]
*  who voted for Trump in 2024, [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2491.9s)]
*  those people are more working class, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2494.58s)]
*  more or less likely to go to college, [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2498.02s)]
*  more likely to be black and Latino [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2500.2599999999998s)]
*  than your average voter. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2504.78s)]
*  They're more likely to be younger [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2505.62s)]
*  and all these people are the ones who are gonna suffer most. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2506.46s)]
*  And so if we can actually communicate with those people, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2508.78s)]
*  which is one of the great challenges [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2512.58s)]
*  as we talked about throughout this podcast, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2513.6600000000003s)]
*  like it could be something that not just delivers to house [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2515.38s)]
*  in my view, it could actually fundamentally [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2518.1800000000003s)]
*  be a political realignment. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2520.54s)]
*  No party has ever done to their voters [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2521.7000000000003s)]
*  what the Republicans have just done to their voters. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2524.26s)]
*  Like this has never happened before. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2526.42s)]
*  No. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2527.98s)]
*  It's an unprecedented moment in American politics [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2528.82s)]
*  and could have unprecedented consequences. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2530.78s)]
*  Yeah, politically brutal vote. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2532.5s)]
*  And even as there is a delay in the implementation [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2534.9s)]
*  of some aspects of the Medicaid portions of the bill, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2540.1s)]
*  we're already seeing there was a story today [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2543.94s)]
*  about a rural hospital in Nebraska that's closing. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2546.22s)]
*  And we will see that. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2550.3s)]
*  And those type of outcomes, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2551.9s)]
*  the stories have to be told as to why it's closing [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2554.98s)]
*  and why people have to drive three hours [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2557.74s)]
*  and why people can't get cancer treatments [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2559.62s)]
*  or treatments for all sorts of things. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2561.58s)]
*  But we'll start to see those. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2563.94s)]
*  And those are things that do hit home. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2565.7s)]
*  No, we have to make Republicans own everything [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2568.46s)]
*  that is wrong with healthcare system here. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2570.2999999999997s)]
*  Much as, I think a lot about [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2572.74s)]
*  when we were in the White House in 2009 [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2575.18s)]
*  and people, like this is the thing [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2578.06s)]
*  that was showing up in focus groups all the time [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2579.62s)]
*  is people were so mad at Barack Obama [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2580.9s)]
*  for raising their taxes. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2582.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2583.38s)]
*  And it's like, no, we gave you a tax cut, right? [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2584.22s)]
*  We know we cut your taxes, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2586.1s)]
*  but they were getting their taxes raised [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2587.38s)]
*  by their state and their county and their city [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2589.34s)]
*  to meet budget shortfalls. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2594.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2595.58s)]
*  And they just assumed that they were blaming us for it. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2596.42s)]
*  Right, so when people aren't getting the, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2597.94s)]
*  when their hospital closes, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2600.94s)]
*  the people aren't getting the services they want, [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2601.98s)]
*  when, you know, they should own healthcare inflation, right? [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2603.94s)]
*  That this is gonna raise costs. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2605.94s)]
*  They should own, frankly, all inflation at this point. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2607.1800000000003s)]
*  That's on us to do it. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2609.54s)]
*  But if we can do that, then I do think it can. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2610.78s)]
*  It will obviate the challenge of the fact [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2613.5s)]
*  that they've delayed these tax cuts. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2616.1800000000003s)]
*  Yes, yeah, I agree. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2617.58s)]
*  All right, the flip side of this anti-incumbent wave, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2620.3s)]
*  if it does materialize, is it can sometimes feel [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2622.54s)]
*  like all you have to do is get out and vote, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2625.0600000000004s)]
*  and it'll take care of itself. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2627.7000000000003s)]
*  But given that many of us live in safe districts, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2628.98s)]
*  we're gonna need to be really focused [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2631.1000000000004s)]
*  on particularly flippable seats. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2632.26s)]
*  The good news is we're gonna have a really powerful story [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2634.3s)]
*  to tell in those places, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2636.1400000000003s)]
*  as you and I have been talking about, Jen. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2637.2200000000003s)]
*  I'm just gonna give some examples from our friends here [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2638.5800000000004s)]
*  at Vote Save America that show how we can win the house. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2640.34s)]
*  I'm gonna start with Gabe Evans in Colorado 8. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2643.46s)]
*  He represents the Northern Denver suburbs. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2645.78s)]
*  He won by less than 2,500 votes last time. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2647.74s)]
*  And under this bill that he just voted for, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2651.2599999999998s)]
*  nearly 30,000 people in his district will lose access [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2653.9399999999996s)]
*  to healthcare and food assistance, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2656.58s)]
*  and nearly 1,000 energy jobs could be lost. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2658.18s)]
*  Marionette Miller Meeks in the first district of Iowa, [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2660.9399999999996s)]
*  she represents Iowa City, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2663.7s)]
*  and she won by a grand total of 799 votes. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2665.1s)]
*  She has been so bombarded by people [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2668.3399999999997s)]
*  that she turned off her social media tags and comments. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2670.2599999999998s)]
*  And in her district, nearly 25,000 people lose access [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2673.2999999999997s)]
*  to healthcare, nearly 29,000 people will lose access [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2676.3s)]
*  to food assistance, and 1,300 energy jobs could be lost, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2678.94s)]
*  and there's one rural hospital [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2683.26s)]
*  in danger of closing, all because of that. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2684.6600000000003s)]
*  Then David Valdeo, as you mentioned, in California 22, [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2686.42s)]
*  he represents Bakersfield. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2689.26s)]
*  He lost his seat in 2018 after voting [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2691.02s)]
*  for Trump's first tax cuts, but then won it back in 2020. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2692.78s)]
*  65,000 people in his district could lose access [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2695.82s)]
*  to their healthcare. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2699.0600000000004s)]
*  60,000 households could lose access to food assistance, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2699.88s)]
*  and 3,612 energy jobs could be lost. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2703.82s)]
*  He just fucked over his district in a truly epic way. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2706.86s)]
*  And so if you people listening here [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2711.3s)]
*  wanna learn more about who we can target [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2712.5800000000004s)]
*  and what we can do to take the house back, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2714.78s)]
*  go to votesaveamerica.com. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2716.3s)]
*  All right, Jen, one last topic on the politics here. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2718.5s)]
*  Elon Musk is still seriously on one about the bill. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2721.5s)]
*  He wrote on the social media site that he owns [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2725.54s)]
*  that every Republican who campaign on cutting spending [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2728.2200000000003s)]
*  and then voted for this bill, quote, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2730.34s)]
*  will lose their primary next year, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2731.5s)]
*  which is the last thing I do on earth. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2732.94s)]
*  He also wrote, if this insane spending bill passes, [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2734.5s)]
*  the American party will be formed the next day. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2737.0s)]
*  Our country needs an alternative [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2739.3s)]
*  to the Democrat, Republican, Uniparty [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2740.46s)]
*  so that people can actually have a voice. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2742.38s)]
*  Do you think the American party is a thing at all [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2744.94s)]
*  and should we give him until Monday [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2746.7000000000003s)]
*  since Friday is a federal holiday? [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2748.14s)]
*  We're graceful people, so we'll give him till Monday, [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2750.3s)]
*  or I will, I don't know about you. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2752.82s)]
*  Look, here's the thing. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2755.42s)]
*  The guy has a lot of money. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2756.4s)]
*  He knows nothing about politics. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2757.56s)]
*  See Wisconsin State Senate race where he wore a cheese hat [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2759.26s)]
*  and threw tens of millions of dollars at it [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2762.42s)]
*  and the liberal justice won. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2765.3s)]
*  People will probably- [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2768.34s)]
*  They struck down the abortion ban in Wisconsin this week. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2769.42s)]
*  Elections have consequences. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2771.82s)]
*  There's an example. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2773.5800000000004s)]
*  But in terms of the party creation, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2775.6600000000003s)]
*  as you know very well, [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2777.5s)]
*  it's very hard to create a third party [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2778.86s)]
*  or to run on third party. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2781.7000000000003s)]
*  Think about the Libertarians or the Green Party. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2783.6200000000003s)]
*  They're on a never-ending battle to get on state ballots [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2786.7000000000003s)]
*  because state laws are all different, right? [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2789.78s)]
*  So he'd have to not just have money. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2792.3s)]
*  It's like a full-time plus job to try and attempt [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2794.36s)]
*  to do something like that [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2797.5s)]
*  in terms of creating another party. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2798.88s)]
*  I think you also have to get, I looked this up today [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2800.94s)]
*  because I like to prep, is like an advisory opinion. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2803.0s)]
*  You have to get an advisory opinion from the FEC to like- [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2806.2200000000003s)]
*  My point is it's really hard to actually do that. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2809.86s)]
*  The other thing this reminds me of is God bless [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2813.44s)]
*  the Howard Schultz period of time [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2817.2200000000003s)]
*  when everybody was like, [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2819.3s)]
*  we need somebody who like, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2820.78s)]
*  we need a party and a person who's not from either side, [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2822.9s)]
*  who can just speak to the middle. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2827.76s)]
*  People say that what, every cycle? [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2829.7200000000003s)]
*  Wasn't there like a Joe Manchin theory at some point? [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2831.42s)]
*  For 2020? [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2834.02s)]
*  Anyway, that never works. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2835.3s)]
*  There is not actually appetite for that. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2837.42s)]
*  Elon Musk is certainly not that. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2839.1800000000003s)]
*  But it reminds me a little bit of that. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2842.1400000000003s)]
*  We're like, maybe the talking point sounds good [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2844.1000000000004s)]
*  on paper for a second [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2846.34s)]
*  until you see Elon Musk's name attached, [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2847.38s)]
*  but also it's really hard to start a third party [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2849.78s)]
*  and do it actually. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2852.02s)]
*  Elon Musk is more likely to colonize Mars [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2853.34s)]
*  than he is to build a viable third party in the sun. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2855.34s)]
*  Should we root for that? [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2857.7400000000002s)]
*  I mean, who's for him colonizing Mars? [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2859.46s)]
*  Have at it, sorry Mars. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2861.82s)]
*  I mean, it's on his agenda, yes. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2863.46s)]
*  You can have him, hopefully he goes. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2866.2200000000003s)]
*  Obviously the world's richest man [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2868.1400000000003s)]
*  could have a huge impact in congressional primaries. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2869.6600000000003s)]
*  Do you think he actually does anything here? [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2871.58s)]
*  It's what's so hard to know. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2873.38s)]
*  And so my theory, which is quite dark [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2874.98s)]
*  and conspiratorial, but here we are, [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2878.16s)]
*  is that Elon Musk kind of already has what he wants. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2879.64s)]
*  I mean, he has all this data, right? [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2882.2799999999997s)]
*  There's been tons of stories about this. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2884.68s)]
*  This is what he wanted from Doge. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2886.2799999999997s)]
*  Doge still has access to all this data. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2887.9199999999996s)]
*  It's data on private sector companies. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2889.8799999999997s)]
*  It's data on competitors. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2891.7999999999997s)]
*  It's data on the American people. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2892.8799999999997s)]
*  So I'm not totally clear [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2894.68s)]
*  if he's just like fucking with Trump, right? [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2896.2s)]
*  And maybe he just like throws in some money [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2898.52s)]
*  and a couple of races to piss Trump off if he's still mad. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2901.0s)]
*  Maybe that's where my gut is. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2904.8399999999997s)]
*  It's hard for me to envision him giving huge amounts [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2907.6400000000003s)]
*  of money to like 50 congressional candidates, [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2910.28s)]
*  but we'll see. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2913.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, he would need to maximize his impact. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2914.92s)]
*  He would need to create a super PAC to spend the money. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2917.6s)]
*  Because he can only give a couple thousand dollars [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2920.0s)]
*  to each primary candidate. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2924.36s)]
*  And so if he, there are lots of rich people [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2926.12s)]
*  who could do that, like ultra wealthy people [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2929.0s)]
*  could do it to every candidate you care about. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2931.04s)]
*  So being the world's richest man [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2932.6800000000003s)]
*  doesn't really help that way. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2934.04s)]
*  You need a super PAC. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2935.0s)]
*  And who's gonna run that super PAC, right? [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2936.32s)]
*  Is there, what happened last time was [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2938.1200000000003s)]
*  he wanted to elect Trump. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2940.36s)]
*  So a bunch of pro-Trump operatives went to him [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2941.36s)]
*  and found a very easy way to separate him from his money. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2942.96s)]
*  Who's gonna do that this time, right? [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2945.8s)]
*  It seems like he wants the attention [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2947.76s)]
*  more than he wants to do the actual work. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2949.36s)]
*  So, I mean, if he wants to beat some of these people [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2950.84s)]
*  and make them lose the primaries, [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2954.28s)]
*  but who's running against them too, right? [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2955.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2957.44s)]
*  Who's the moderate, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2958.6000000000004s)]
*  because we're talking about beating them. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2959.44s)]
*  Who's the pro-doge Republican [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2960.8s)]
*  who's running in Wisconsin three or whatever else. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2963.96s)]
*  Like it just, [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2966.4s)]
*  it just doesn't matter who that person is. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2967.2400000000002s)]
*  Right, this is like, I don't know who that vote, [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2968.08s)]
*  like who is that candidate? [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2969.76s)]
*  And like, who is the pool of people who are like, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2971.16s)]
*  I want Elon Musk to really take more control here. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2973.32s)]
*  I don't know where that exists, so. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2976.68s)]
*  All right, let's talk about immigration quickly [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2979.44s)]
*  before we go. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2981.08s)]
*  Trump took a trip to Florida for a photo op [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2981.92s)]
*  at the so-called Alligator Alcatraz, [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2983.88s)]
*  the new Migrants' Attention Center [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2986.32s)]
*  built by Rhonda Santus in the middle of the Everglades [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2987.64s)]
*  as basically a political stunt. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2989.96s)]
*  Discussion yielded by the visit [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2991.44s)]
*  was about as high-minded as you'd expect. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2992.72s)]
*  Let's take a listen. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2994.2799999999997s)]
*  We have a lot of bodyguards and a lot of cops [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2995.12s)]
*  that are in the form of alligators. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2998.16s)]
*  You don't have to pay them so much. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=2999.6s)]
*  We're gonna teach them how to run away from an alligator, [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3001.2s)]
*  okay, if they escape prison. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3004.8799999999997s)]
*  How to run away. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3007.0s)]
*  Don't run in a straight line. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3008.24s)]
*  Run like this. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3009.9199999999996s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3010.7599999999998s)]
*  Your chances go up about 1%. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3011.7999999999997s)]
*  I think our viewers at home should know [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3013.9199999999996s)]
*  that this is air-conditioned facility, [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3015.56s)]
*  so if any of the news claims are keeping them out [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3017.3999999999996s)]
*  in the hot humid South Florida, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3019.72s)]
*  that is wrong. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3021.24s)]
*  It's probably 62 degrees in here. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3022.08s)]
*  Or 72. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3023.9199999999996s)]
*  Hey, Biden wanted me in here, okay? [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3024.7599999999998s)]
*  That's it. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3027.0s)]
*  He wanted me. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3028.16s)]
*  It didn't work out that way, [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3029.0s)]
*  but he wanted me in here. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3029.8399999999997s)]
*  It's a lot to unpack there. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3032.72s)]
*  Alligators make good cops. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3033.9199999999996s)]
*  That's my favorite line. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3035.9199999999996s)]
*  Is any of this helpful beyond Trump's base, do you think? [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3037.4399999999996s)]
*  For him? [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3040.16s)]
*  Yeah, for anyone. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3041.08s)]
*  Well, here's what's kind of interesting [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3042.64s)]
*  over the last six months to me at least. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3045.3599999999997s)]
*  Where Trump was, [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3047.64s)]
*  winning on the border argument, right? [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3050.42s)]
*  And keeping us safer on the border. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3053.2200000000003s)]
*  And then when you started to see what he was doing [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3055.7400000000002s)]
*  under the guise of insane lunatic Stephen Miller [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3058.46s)]
*  and his 3000 a day goal of arresting migrants [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3061.66s)]
*  and kidnapping them and kicking them out of the country, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3065.58s)]
*  people don't like the individual things, right? [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3068.66s)]
*  So it's like, including deporting people, [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3071.14s)]
*  including Kilmar Obregge Garcia, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3073.78s)]
*  including pulling people off the streets. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3075.7000000000003s)]
*  It's like, this is not what we want the border to be safe, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3078.2999999999997s)]
*  but we don't like all of these things. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3081.62s)]
*  And so Alligator Alcatraz, I don't know. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3083.9399999999996s)]
*  I guess maybe his base finds it funny. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3086.98s)]
*  Maybe his base finds it to be a continuation of him. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3089.4599999999996s)]
*  Like I'm being tough on the border. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3093.98s)]
*  I'm sending people here. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3095.5s)]
*  It's hard for me to envision it being appealing beyond that. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3097.8999999999996s)]
*  I mean, it's like the cruelty is the point. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3101.74s)]
*  The joking about putting people in a place [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3104.06s)]
*  that's surrounded by snakes and alligators. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3106.86s)]
*  It's also, I mean, what struck me about this is like, [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3109.34s)]
*  it's very much in the vein of I'm a strong man. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3112.38s)]
*  I'm so powerful. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3114.98s)]
*  I'm gonna use the military to go in LA. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3115.86s)]
*  And look, I have all these dangerous reptiles. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3117.94s)]
*  I mean, it's so bizarre. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3120.38s)]
*  But all these dangerous reptiles [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3121.42s)]
*  who are gonna prevent migrants from being free. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3122.7400000000002s)]
*  And meanwhile, the overwhelming majority of people [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3125.42s)]
*  that they are arresting, pulling off the streets, [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3127.94s)]
*  pulling from their kids, pulling from their parents, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3130.78s)]
*  are people who don't have any criminal record, right? [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3133.98s)]
*  It's like, so it's this language that doesn't even match. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3138.2200000000003s)]
*  They're not going after the people with criminal records [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3142.42s)]
*  because they're harder to get. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3144.38s)]
*  So to me, it's just all of this, [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3145.42s)]
*  I'm gonna like beat my chest strong man tactics [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3147.9s)]
*  that he like resorts to all the time. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3150.46s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think there's probably a ton of strategy [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3153.26s)]
*  or I think he probably thought the idea of, [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3155.18s)]
*  like he's obviously obsessed with Alcatraz. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3157.78s)]
*  He thought the idea of alligators eating, [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3159.26s)]
*  escaping migrants probably seems appealing to him [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3162.06s)]
*  in some way. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3164.14s)]
*  Like the impact of it, [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3165.3s)]
*  I don't think it has much of a political impact. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3166.3s)]
*  You're exactly right. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3167.42s)]
*  His numbers of immigration have gone down. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3168.38s)]
*  They're now almost as bad as his numbers on the economy, [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3170.22s)]
*  which is like a real problem for him [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3172.46s)]
*  over the medium term at least. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3174.22s)]
*  What it does is it soaks up attention, right? [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3176.38s)]
*  This is the kind of thing. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3178.42s)]
*  This is what Rhonda Santos frankly very good at [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3179.34s)]
*  before he embarrassed himself on the national stage [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3181.5s)]
*  for the Republican primary. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3183.58s)]
*  And Trump is doing the same thing, [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3185.02s)]
*  which is just like, [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3186.46s)]
*  I've done something that's gonna dominate attention [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3187.3s)]
*  for a day. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3189.58s)]
*  Probably takes attention away from the bill [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3190.66s)]
*  that was passing at the time. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3192.1s)]
*  You know, you can just, [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3194.7s)]
*  like these are the kind of clips [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3195.54s)]
*  that go viral on TikTok, right? [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3196.42s)]
*  Both from people loving Trump for doing it, [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3198.14s)]
*  always in this cool and funny [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3200.62s)]
*  and people making fun of him for doing it [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3201.98s)]
*  or hating on him for doing it. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3203.8599999999997s)]
*  And so it kind of soaks up attention, [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3205.3399999999997s)]
*  but it's like, [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3206.54s)]
*  I mean, it's gross and disgusting [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3207.3799999999997s)]
*  and cruel and everything else. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3208.8999999999996s)]
*  But I think the political impact of it [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3212.22s)]
*  is probably pretty limited. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3214.7s)]
*  Well, he went there also the day after the Senate [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3215.54s)]
*  passed the big ugly bill. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3218.54s)]
*  So like that is telling. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3220.94s)]
*  He wanted to talk about alligator Alcatraz [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3221.94s)]
*  more than he wanted to talk about his signature legislation. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3223.94s)]
*  Yeah, cause like in a different world, [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3226.26s)]
*  a president would go do an event somewhere [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3228.26s)]
*  to build momentum on the passage [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3231.78s)]
*  of your signature legislation [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3233.6600000000003s)]
*  to get it through the house. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3234.86s)]
*  And instead he went to a place to talk about [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3235.7400000000002s)]
*  how to run into zigzag [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3237.82s)]
*  to avoid getting eaten by an alligator. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3239.82s)]
*  Something I was taught at an early age [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3241.1400000000003s)]
*  when I went to visit my grandmother in Florida. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3242.5s)]
*  Oh, tough lesson. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3244.54s)]
*  There weren't a lot of alligators [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3246.46s)]
*  by her apartment complex, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3247.42s)]
*  but I do remember my grandfather teaching me that. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3249.62s)]
*  Dan from Delaware living the tough life as a child. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3252.1s)]
*  There you go. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3254.74s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3255.58s)]
*  In the mean streets of Boca Raton [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3256.42s)]
*  where my grandparents retired too. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3257.2599999999998s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3258.74s)]
*  Okay. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3259.58s)]
*  One potential inmate and alligator Alcatraz is [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3260.42s)]
*  Zoran Mondami, [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3262.8199999999997s)]
*  New York City's democratic candidate for mayor. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3263.8599999999997s)]
*  Trump this week threatened to denaturalize [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3266.2999999999997s)]
*  and deport Mondami if he defies ICE. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3268.42s)]
*  Mondami then fired back on Wednesday. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3270.2999999999997s)]
*  Here's a sampling of that back and forth. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3271.7799999999997s)]
*  You have to arrest him. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3273.66s)]
*  Look, we don't need a communist in this country, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3275.38s)]
*  but if we have one, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3278.34s)]
*  I'm gonna be watching over him very carefully [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3279.1800000000003s)]
*  on behalf of the nation. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3280.98s)]
*  A lot of people saying he's here illegally. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3282.6600000000003s)]
*  He's, you know, we're gonna look at everything. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3285.1400000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump said that I should be arrested. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3287.46s)]
*  He said that I should be deported. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3291.7400000000002s)]
*  He said that I should be denaturalized. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3293.82s)]
*  Less so because of who I am, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3296.7400000000002s)]
*  because of where I come from, [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3299.02s)]
*  because of how I look or how I speak, [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3300.46s)]
*  and more so because he wants to distract [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3302.2200000000003s)]
*  from what I fight for. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3304.6200000000003s)]
*  I fight for working people. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3306.1000000000004s)]
*  I fight for the very people [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3308.06s)]
*  that have been priced out of this city, [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3309.66s)]
*  and I fight for the same people [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3310.86s)]
*  that he said he was fighting for. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3312.06s)]
*  It is easier for him to fan the flames of division [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3313.74s)]
*  than to acknowledge the ways in which he has betrayed [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3316.66s)]
*  those working class Americans. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3318.66s)]
*  What did you make of his response? [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3320.14s)]
*  Very good. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3321.54s)]
*  I mean, he is an incredibly gifted communicator, [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3322.5s)]
*  Mom Donnie is, which is kind of stating the obvious. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3327.02s)]
*  What was very smart about it is he didn't take the bait, [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3331.38s)]
*  and he called it out for what it is. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3335.8s)]
*  And that is exactly the right tactic with a bully. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3338.64s)]
*  That's what people should do if, [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3341.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, I will say from personal experience, [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3343.92s)]
*  being attacked by Vladimir Putin, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3346.08s)]
*  you gotta punch him back and call him out [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3347.76s)]
*  for why they're calling you out. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3349.36s)]
*  And that's exactly what he did. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3350.92s)]
*  Trump is, the Republican Party, it's a state the obvious, [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3354.92s)]
*  I know you guys have talked about this, [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3359.28s)]
*  they wanna make Mom Donnie out to be the symbol, right, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3360.2400000000002s)]
*  of every Democratic candidate. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3364.4s)]
*  He's an insanely gifted communicator, a huge star. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3366.64s)]
*  His politics would not work in every district in the country [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3370.2400000000002s)]
*  just to state the obvious, right? [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3372.7000000000003s)]
*  He's not trying to say that, [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3375.4s)]
*  nor is that what he's conveying. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3377.08s)]
*  But that's what they're trying to do. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3379.42s)]
*  And I also am betting, Trump, [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3380.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, Trump wants Eric Adams to remain mayor. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3383.08s)]
*  So there's like lots going on here. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3385.2400000000002s)]
*  But include, and obviously all of that [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3387.0s)]
*  is like gross dog whistle stuff. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3389.06s)]
*  But I think that's a good model [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3390.64s)]
*  for when you're attacked by Trump, [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3393.62s)]
*  call him out for why he's attacking. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3395.66s)]
*  He attacks people he thinks are effective. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3397.16s)]
*  That's why he attacks them, right? [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3399.62s)]
*  He doesn't go after, I mean, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3401.14s)]
*  he's sometimes weak people in the primary, [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3403.3399999999997s)]
*  but he attacks people that he sees as kind of a, [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3405.94s)]
*  he's seen them around too much. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3408.38s)]
*  But yeah, I thought it was really good. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3410.54s)]
*  What about you? [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3411.42s)]
*  Yeah, I think what I thought really was interesting is, [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3412.48s)]
*  Trump is obviously attacking him for who he is, right? [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3416.02s)]
*  Like Trump cannot fathom the idea [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3418.14s)]
*  that a 33-year-old immigrant [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3420.66s)]
*  could be the mayor of his home city. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3422.14s)]
*  Like that something must be awry, illegal, rigged. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3423.9s)]
*  It's the same reason he had to believe [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3427.74s)]
*  that Barack Obama had cheated on his birth certificate. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3429.58s)]
*  Right, was actually a Muslim from Kenya. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3432.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you can't like it's like, [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3435.62s)]
*  his brain cannot factor the idea [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3437.7s)]
*  that someone like Zoran Mondani [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3439.7s)]
*  could beat the pants off of someone like Andrew Cuomo [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3443.06s)]
*  in a Democratic primary in New York City. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3445.62s)]
*  Like he doesn't work there. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3446.8599999999997s)]
*  So it has to be something else. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3447.94s)]
*  So it's all gross dog whistles stuff. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3449.02s)]
*  What is this interesting is just, [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3451.5s)]
*  and this goes to, I think his talents as a communicator. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3452.34s)]
*  And it really is like, I think a model [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3454.54s)]
*  for progressive politicians [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3457.3s)]
*  is he is laser focused [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3461.34s)]
*  on his working class advocacy [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3465.54s)]
*  and his popular positions. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3468.3s)]
*  Right, because it like, it is what he did was racist. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3470.06s)]
*  What he did was jingoistic. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3472.74s)]
*  What he did was offensive, [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3474.22s)]
*  but he took it and he pivoted right to the idea [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3475.82s)]
*  that he's attacking him because he's, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3478.86s)]
*  because Mondani is tough on Trump's friends, [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3481.9s)]
*  the billionaires that he, like it's just, [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3483.7000000000003s)]
*  it's just the way that he, like, [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3485.94s)]
*  I don't, I'm not saying I know what the right answer here is [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3488.54s)]
*  because people can handle this differently, [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3490.6200000000003s)]
*  but it's notable to me that Mondani, [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3492.2200000000003s)]
*  who's like, everyone's talking about [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3495.2200000000003s)]
*  how he can't run all these places. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3496.6200000000003s)]
*  He's a prime for the Democrats, [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3497.7000000000003s)]
*  how he specifically avoided identitarian politics [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3498.54s)]
*  and went right to his populist economic argument, [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3502.58s)]
*  which is what every centrist democratic consultant [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3504.7000000000003s)]
*  would argue you do, right? [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3508.06s)]
*  And he did it, I thought he did very well. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3509.54s)]
*  Like he's clearly very, very talented. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3510.74s)]
*  And I was like, I took note of how he handled it. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3512.18s)]
*  And I think other people could learn some lessons from it. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3514.9s)]
*  I think it's a model for anyone, [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3516.7s)]
*  no matter where you fall in the political spectrum. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3519.46s)]
*  You could do that if you're running against Dave Valdaya [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3521.5s)]
*  or any of those other people I mentioned, [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3523.9s)]
*  those exact words. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3525.14s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3525.98s)]
*  And that being laser focused on working people [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3527.02s)]
*  and how you talk about it. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3530.94s)]
*  And yeah, I think that was a very good, [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3532.34s)]
*  and what I mean, as you know, [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3535.46s)]
*  the working people message is exactly what the message should be. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3537.78s)]
*  It's mainly being a member [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3541.38s)]
*  of the Democratic Socialist of America. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3543.5s)]
*  Right, and he's a proud member and that works for him. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3544.7400000000002s)]
*  And obviously he just crushed Andrew Cuomo. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3547.46s)]
*  But he's not, if you ask him, and I've asked him, [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3550.2200000000003s)]
*  it's not like he's saying everybody should run [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3552.5s)]
*  as a democratic socialist. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3554.54s)]
*  That's not what he's saying. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3555.78s)]
*  So my point is he's not saying that, [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3556.7000000000003s)]
*  but the Republican Party is trying to make that be the case [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3558.98s)]
*  or that be the perception. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3563.1800000000003s)]
*  But yeah, I think that was a very well-handled response. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3564.7s)]
*  Okay, one last thing before I let you go, [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3569.58s)]
*  Paramount, the parent company of CBS News, [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3571.3799999999997s)]
*  announced on Tuesday that it will pay $16 million [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3573.3799999999997s)]
*  to settle Trump's lawsuit [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3577.06s)]
*  over the 60 minutes Kamala Harris interview. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3578.18s)]
*  Payment will cover Trump's legal fees [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3580.62s)]
*  and the balance will go to his [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3582.1s)]
*  Presidential Library Foundation, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3583.1s)]
*  which I'm sure will be used to buy books. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3584.66s)]
*  Obviously. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3586.9399999999996s)]
*  As a reminder, this is a totally frivolous lawsuit [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3588.54s)]
*  over a segment of an interview [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3591.4199999999996s)]
*  that Donald Trump wasn't even a part of, [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3592.58s)]
*  but Paramount has a big merger in front of Trump's goons [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3594.26s)]
*  and seemed to think it had to pay up. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3596.82s)]
*  Jen, just as the TV professional on this podcast, [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3599.0200000000004s)]
*  can you explain what 60 Minutes did [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3601.3s)]
*  and didn't do with the Harris interview? [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3602.98s)]
*  So correct me here if I get any aspect wrong. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3605.0600000000004s)]
*  Basically, they did a lengthy interview with her [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3608.2200000000003s)]
*  and they edited down the interview [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3612.1000000000004s)]
*  and they used a portion of the interview, [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3614.86s)]
*  a smaller portion, that they aired on a different CBS show. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3617.34s)]
*  And Trump's issue, or the issue they argue, [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3622.5s)]
*  is that they made that edit down, made Harris look better. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3626.06s)]
*  I think I'm getting this right here, [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3630.9s)]
*  if I remember all the details. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3632.1400000000003s)]
*  Now, it prompted through this process, [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3634.26s)]
*  CBS to release the full transcript [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3637.02s)]
*  and everything from the interview, [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3639.26s)]
*  which actually when you look at the full context [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3641.2200000000003s)]
*  of the interview, she actually looks better [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3643.3s)]
*  in the full context. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3644.78s)]
*  She doesn't look amazing in either one, [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3645.7000000000003s)]
*  but she looks better in the full context [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3647.7400000000002s)]
*  than she does in the edited down. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3650.02s)]
*  That's kind of the irony here, but that's what it is. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3651.46s)]
*  Now, you and I have been a part of, [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3654.7400000000002s)]
*  I mean, how many interviews did Barack Obama [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3657.06s)]
*  do with Steve Croft? [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3659.46s)]
*  So many, at least once a year for 10 years. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3661.66s)]
*  I mean, I don't even know. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3663.38s)]
*  And they were like often hours long [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3664.2200000000003s)]
*  and they would be edited down. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3667.46s)]
*  This is kind of the normal course of business [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3668.82s)]
*  and Republican candidates would do hours long interviews [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3671.02s)]
*  with them, McCain probably did, Romney, all these people. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3674.46s)]
*  It's 60 Minutes, they only have so many minutes, [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3677.3s)]
*  even in the 60 Minutes. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3679.7s)]
*  So it's pretty standard fare for networks to do [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3681.74s)]
*  when they interview any big guests, [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3686.2999999999997s)]
*  any taped interview, you edit it down. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3687.9399999999996s)]
*  Yeah, this is entirely from this lawsuit [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3690.02s)]
*  that every single legal person on either side of the aisle [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3692.8199999999997s)]
*  thought CBS would easily win if they had gone to trial. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3695.74s)]
*  It probably would have never gone to trial, [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3699.46s)]
*  it would have been tossed out by a judge. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3700.7799999999997s)]
*  But because they truly, like this is just, [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3702.66s)]
*  can't emphasize this enough, [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3705.46s)]
*  they have a merger before the FCC. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3706.82s)]
*  The FCC run by Trump's goons has to approve that merger. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3709.98s)]
*  The owners of Paramount will get billions of dollars [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3714.1400000000003s)]
*  if that merger goes through. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3717.6600000000003s)]
*  If it doesn't, they're actually in huge financial trouble [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3718.6600000000003s)]
*  because a whole bunch of pending debt [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3721.54s)]
*  that the Paramount Corporation has. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3723.38s)]
*  And they feel like they have to pay tribute to Trump. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3725.6200000000003s)]
*  They have to give him $16 million [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3730.38s)]
*  to have a pretty standard merger approved. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3731.86s)]
*  And this comes on top of ABC paying [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3735.02s)]
*  a similar amount of money, the Walt Disney Corporation [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3737.5s)]
*  paying a similar amount of money [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3740.34s)]
*  to settle a lawsuit involving George Stephanopoulos. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3741.18s)]
*  And we're really sort of, [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3743.46s)]
*  I guess my question for you based on this, [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3744.46s)]
*  how discouraging and dangerous [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3746.22s)]
*  do you think this settlement is? [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3747.62s)]
*  Well, first of all, the message it sends to people [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3749.22s)]
*  like Trump and his lawyer goon squad is not, [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3751.86s)]
*  it's over and we've settled it, [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3754.82s)]
*  it's you're a good target to watch [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3756.54s)]
*  what other interviews people are doing [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3758.62s)]
*  and see if we can target more. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3760.62s)]
*  I mean, this is what you see with law firms [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3762.38s)]
*  or with universities. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3763.9s)]
*  They don't stop when you acquiesce. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3765.26s)]
*  They keep going because they know you're a target for it. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3767.54s)]
*  This is like, you know, so there's that. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3770.1s)]
*  What concerns me is, and you and I worked in media [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3773.54s)]
*  for so long, it's like, [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3778.06s)]
*  is that you never know what's happening [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3780.7000000000003s)]
*  in the editorial meetings, right? [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3782.7400000000002s)]
*  And while the editorial meetings [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3784.46s)]
*  are not linked to the legal judgments, right? [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3785.78s)]
*  But what you don't know is like what edict is coming down [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3788.82s)]
*  from any of these places to the editorial leadership [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3791.82s)]
*  about how they're supposed to be covering [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3794.9s)]
*  the Trump administration. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3797.86s)]
*  And it's not to suggest, it's not as obvious [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3799.42s)]
*  as go on TV and say Trump is great [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3802.06s)]
*  and the best president in history. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3804.5800000000004s)]
*  Like that wouldn't be authentic. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3805.9s)]
*  It's like, what stories are killed, right? [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3807.26s)]
*  What stories aren't pursued? [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3810.34s)]
*  I mean, remember Bill Owens from 60 Minutes [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3812.26s)]
*  also resigned like just this year. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3814.6600000000003s)]
*  What stories were killed there? [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3817.9s)]
*  What were the frustrations about? [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3819.7000000000003s)]
*  So the piece that concerns me is the obedience [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3821.06s)]
*  in advance that you don't see, right? [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3824.62s)]
*  And most people don't know like you and I do [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3826.74s)]
*  that that's where the discussions are had. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3829.46s)]
*  I mean, questions that are asked [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3831.82s)]
*  in the White House briefing room often come out from down [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3833.1s)]
*  from like corporate news people in different places. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3835.74s)]
*  They're not always invented by the reporters in the room. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3838.42s)]
*  Sometimes they are, you know? [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3840.34s)]
*  And that's the piece that's concerning. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3842.82s)]
*  What decisions are made about what stories [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3844.98s)]
*  get to be on the air and how Trump is covered. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3846.9s)]
*  And that no one will ever be able to see. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3849.86s)]
*  It's disproving a negative. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3851.58s)]
*  So that's the piece that I think about a lot. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3853.1s)]
*  Yeah, and if you're someone who doesn't really care [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3855.3s)]
*  about media or thinks that, you know, traditional media [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3857.86s)]
*  or corporate media is doomed, [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3861.94s)]
*  there is one other consequence of this, [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3864.02s)]
*  which is Paramount also owns Comedy Central [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3865.42s)]
*  and they are reportedly delaying the latest season [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3868.9s)]
*  of South Park because they're afraid it's going [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3871.7400000000002s)]
*  to make fun of Trump and upset them and upend the merger. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3873.26s)]
*  So it's like, we're even allowing Trump [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3876.1s)]
*  to make programming decisions at Comedy Central [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3878.5s)]
*  for fear of upsetting our mad king. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3880.58s)]
*  So I've just leave people with that notion. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3883.14s)]
*  Okay, when we come back from the break, [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3885.78s)]
*  you'll hear my conversation with Congressman Ro Khanna [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3887.26s)]
*  about what Democrats should be doing in this moment. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3889.18s)]

*  Let's face it, after a night with drinks, [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3935.9s)]
*  I don't bounce back the next day like I used to. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3937.26s)]
*  I have to make a choice. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3939.2200000000003s)]
*  I can either have a great night or a great next day. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3940.0600000000004s)]
*  That is until I found pre-alcohol. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3942.26s)]
*  Zbiotics Pre-Alcohol Probiotic Drink [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3945.34s)]
*  is the world's first genetically engineered probiotic. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3947.5400000000004s)]
*  It was invented by PhD scientists [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3950.2200000000003s)]
*  to tackle rough mornings after drinking. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3951.7000000000003s)]
*  Here's how it works. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3953.5800000000004s)]
*  When you drink, alcohol gets converted [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3954.42s)]
*  into a toxic byproduct in the gut. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3955.7400000000002s)]
*  It's a buildup of this byproduct and not dehydration [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3957.7400000000002s)]
*  that's to blame for rough days after drinking. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3960.86s)]
*  Pre-alcohol produces an enzyme to break this byproduct down. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3963.34s)]
*  Just remember to make pre-alcohol [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3966.42s)]
*  your first drink of the night, [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3967.9s)]
*  drink responsibly, and feel your best tomorrow. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3969.34s)]
*  This ad is reminding me that I'm out of Zbiotics [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3972.34s)]
*  and that gives me enormous anxiety [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3975.38s)]
*  because I basically won't touch a drink [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3977.02s)]
*  without having a Zbiotics first [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3979.1800000000003s)]

*  I don't know, whatever it does, it works for me. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3987.94s)]
*  I feel exponentially better when I have a Zbiotics [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3990.86s)]
*  before I have any alcohol and you will too. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=3995.3s)]

*  like breathable flow-knit polos, crisp cotton shirts [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4047.5s)]
*  and comfortable lightweight pants [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4050.66s)]

*  Great sheets from Quince. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4075.6600000000003s)]
*  Can I get some sheets? [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4076.5s)]

*  I went and looked, they had a great kind of bag, [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4079.7s)]
*  not like a fanny pack, fanny pack adjacent. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4084.22s)]
*  I can't remember what it was called. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4086.54s)]
*  Sounds like they have a lot of great options. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4087.58s)]

*  in the house over the last 24 hours is Congressman Ro Khanna. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4117.18s)]
*  Congressman, welcome back to Pots of America. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4120.2s)]
*  Well Dan, that's a perfect summary. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4122.62s)]
*  As I flew back Tuesday night and just watched [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4124.3s)]
*  one by one Republicans cave in the middle of the night, [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4128.78s)]
*  predictable but still sad to see. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4133.54s)]
*  Yeah, as you were watching it happen, [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4135.78s)]
*  did you have hope that they might hold [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4137.72s)]
*  or did you know they were always going to fold? [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4140.04s)]
*  Were you watching the arms get twisted? [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4141.360000000001s)]
*  Set the scene for us a little bit. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4143.08s)]
*  Well, you know, I figured they would fold. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4144.56s)]
*  I've been through the story too many times [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4146.400000000001s)]
*  and the fear is palpable. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4148.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean, look, I had done a war powers resolution [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4150.08s)]
*  with Thomas Massey to keep us out of war in Iran [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4153.88s)]
*  and Massey was targeted by not just Donald Trump's tweets, [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4156.6s)]
*  his top lieutenants, the people who won the presidency. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4162.16s)]
*  Donald Trump says, I'm going to put you in charge [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4165.16s)]
*  of taking out Massey and that was a chilling signal, [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4168.24s)]
*  not just to Massey, but to every Republican. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4170.48s)]
*  I mean, they are in world fair being singled out [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4172.959999999999s)]
*  by Donald Trump. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4176.16s)]
*  But you know, when we had the vote Tuesday [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4177.759999999999s)]
*  or two nights ago or I guess last night, it was. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4182.0s)]
*  It's been a long couple of days here. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4187.2s)]
*  It's been a long, I haven't had sleep for a while [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4189.04s)]
*  so you'll have to try to get. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4191.24s)]
*  Of course, we understand. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4193.36s)]
*  10 PM and you know, there were about 10 Republicans short [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4195.28s)]
*  and I thought, okay, you know, it's going to take them [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4199.88s)]
*  a couple of days, but they just kept that vote open [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4202.8s)]
*  all night and you heard about the different deals [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4205.4s)]
*  they were making with Republicans promising them [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4208.92s)]
*  that they would get further cuts [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4212.54s)]
*  in a future reconciliation bill, [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4214.679999999999s)]
*  promising Trump would do some executive order [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4216.5199999999995s)]
*  and one by one, you saw them basically folding [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4219.92s)]
*  and the terrible result we saw this morning. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4224.24s)]
*  It's like we have come to, you know, [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4226.92s)]
*  like I thought they were going to fold. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4228.76s)]
*  We've seen this play several times now in the Trump era. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4230.24s)]
*  But when you like step back from sort of the insanity [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4234.12s)]
*  of this moment, what they just did really seems totally [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4236.36s)]
*  off the wall, right? [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4242.62s)]
*  You have one and two ones. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4243.76s)]
*  One, these members said like 24 hours earlier, [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4245.82s)]
*  they would never vote for this bill. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4248.84s)]
*  They declare like, unless I get changes, [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4250.84s)]
*  I'm never voting for it. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4253.32s)]
*  They called it a piece of shit. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4254.16s)]
*  They were all over it. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4255.44s)]
*  They got no changes, right? [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4257.2s)]
*  The exact same text that came back to the Senate. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4259.32s)]
*  The exact same Senate bill. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4261.16s)]
*  And they all voted for it. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4262.639999999999s)]
*  And on top of that, all of the polling says [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4264.04s)]
*  the bill's incredibly unpopular. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4266.96s)]
*  Every person seems to imagine this is going to make it harder [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4268.48s)]
*  for them to win to keep power. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4270.84s)]
*  And yet they did it anyway. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4272.32s)]
*  In your conversations with Republicans who are watching them, [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4274.04s)]
*  do they believe like, do they believe their own bullshit here [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4275.759999999999s)]
*  or is this really just sort of fear of Trump? [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4278.82s)]
*  It's fear of Trump. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4282.4s)]
*  They're in the Tom Tillis situation, right? [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4283.4s)]
*  Tillis knows that he can't win the general election voting [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4285.48s)]
*  for these Medicaid cuts. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4288.639999999999s)]
*  And so he's holding out, holding out, holding out, [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4290.44s)]
*  and probably positioning himself better [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4293.08s)]
*  for the general election. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4294.379999999999s)]
*  And then Donald Trump basically tweets out [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4295.219999999999s)]
*  that I'm going to support a primary challenge. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4297.48s)]
*  And within 12 hours, Tillis says, [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4300.36s)]
*  I'm not running for reelection. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4304.28s)]
*  I mean, you got to look, if Barack Obama tomorrow decided [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4306.16s)]
*  to endorse a primary challenge against me, [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4309.839999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't be happy, but I wouldn't quit. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4311.92s)]
*  You know? [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4314.12s)]
*  I mean, it's not like, it's unbelievable. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4314.9400000000005s)]
*  It's like Trump doesn't support you [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4319.0s)]
*  and your career is literally done. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4321.400000000001s)]
*  And so I think these folks knew [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4324.4400000000005s)]
*  that they were between a rock and a hard place. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4327.04s)]
*  If they voted no, they were done. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4331.08s)]
*  And so they're rolling the dice [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4333.8s)]
*  and they're counting on basically being able [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4335.24s)]
*  to mislead the American people. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4337.88s)]
*  They pushed out a lot of these cuts to 2020, [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4339.5199999999995s)]
*  late 2026, 2027, and they're hoping they can skate by [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4342.5599999999995s)]
*  before the cuts really impact people. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4347.32s)]
*  Now, I don't think that'll be the case. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4349.96s)]
*  States will do anticipatory cuts, [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4351.2s)]
*  but that's the bet they're making. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4353.36s)]
*  You know, we've talked a lot on this podcast [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4355.5199999999995s)]
*  over the last several weeks about the cuts to Medicaid, [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4357.48s)]
*  the cuts to SNAP, the tax cuts for the rich, [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4360.16s)]
*  the clean energy jobs that will be lost. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4362.4s)]
*  But I feel like every hour I'm learning [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4364.44s)]
*  about another terrible thing in this bill. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4366.6s)]
*  Somehow I did not realize that they eliminate direct file [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4369.68s)]
*  for the IRS in here, making it so much harder [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4371.96s)]
*  for people to file their own taxes. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4373.72s)]
*  What are some of the other things in this bill [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4375.160000000001s)]
*  you think people should know about [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4376.84s)]
*  that may not have broken through to people? [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4377.96s)]
*  Well, they make it very hard for people [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4379.96s)]
*  who are paying back their student loans [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4381.6s)]
*  to get loan forgiveness. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4383.6s)]
*  You know, there are programs where [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4384.52s)]
*  if you make every monthly payment for 25 years, [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4385.92s)]
*  the government will forgive those loans, [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4389.92s)]
*  they take that away. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4392.360000000001s)]
*  If you're a doctor or a nurse who's doing public service, [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4393.200000000001s)]
*  there are programs that'll help you with student loans. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4396.08s)]
*  They take that away. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4398.4s)]
*  If you come on hard times and you can't make a payment, [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4400.16s)]
*  there are things that were there to help you. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4403.72s)]
*  They take that away. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4406.36s)]
*  They got funding for university science research in there. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4408.4s)]
*  They are, of course, the most cruel parts [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4414.64s)]
*  of taking away the healthcare and the food assistance. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4418.04s)]
*  But just to put this in perspective, [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4421.68s)]
*  George W. Bush's tax cuts were awful [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4423.44s)]
*  and skewed towards the very rich, [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4426.04s)]
*  but everyone got something. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4428.16s)]
*  And Trump's first tax cuts were also skewed for the very rich, [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4430.92s)]
*  but everyone got something. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4434.2s)]
*  You know, you were poor working class, you got something. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4435.28s)]
*  This is the first time in modern history [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4437.8s)]
*  where while the rich are actually getting tax breaks, [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4440.56s)]
*  the working class and the poor are getting screwed. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4443.28s)]
*  Like they're being worse off. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4445.84s)]
*  They're losing money while the rich are getting more money. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4447.36s)]
*  And it's literally unbelievable that they all voted for this, [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4451.12s)]
*  especially because the can of truth [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4455.16s)]
*  is more of the working class moved to their direction [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4456.8s)]
*  and they're shafting them to help the people in my district. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4460.0s)]
*  I mean, it's just, when you look at the distribution [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4462.88s)]
*  of what this bill is gonna do, it's shocking. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4465.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's really interesting [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4468.4s)]
*  because like this is the pipe dream, right? [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4469.6s)]
*  This is what Paul Ryan used to wake up every morning to do, [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4471.5199999999995s)]
*  which was to cut taxes for the rich [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4474.64s)]
*  and pay for it by gutting Medicaid [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4475.96s)]
*  and his minus for social security Medicare. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4478.4s)]
*  Back then, right, from basically the days of Reagan [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4480.76s)]
*  through the Obama years, [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4485.52s)]
*  when the Republicans pushed that policy, [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4486.92s)]
*  the tax cuts were benefiting their voters [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4489.04s)]
*  and the cuts to social services were hurting [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4491.4400000000005s)]
*  Democratic voters. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4494.0s)]
*  That's now no longer the case. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4495.4400000000005s)]
*  Trump actually won voters who made under $50,000. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4497.320000000001s)]
*  So Kamala Harris won the voters made over 100,000. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4500.16s)]
*  It just seems just wild to me. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4502.68s)]
*  It's like they have not updated their policy agenda [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4504.24s)]
*  to reflect the shift in their political coalition. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4507.08s)]
*  It's like they're waging war on their own voters. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4510.8s)]
*  They literally are. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4513.0s)]
*  I mean, some of these districts, like Valdello's district, [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4513.92s)]
*  over 100,000 people, 150,000 people on Medicaid, [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4516.92s)]
*  you would think he wouldn't won a trillion dollars [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4521.04s)]
*  in cuts to Medicaid. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4523.2s)]
*  And yet he's voting for those cuts [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4525.24s)]
*  to benefit districts like mine, [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4527.8s)]
*  which has a lot of the billionaires. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4530.4s)]
*  And I think it's two things. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4531.84s)]
*  One, they're counting on being able to lie, [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4532.96s)]
*  basically controlling the media narrative to say, [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4535.68s)]
*  oh, nothing changed. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4540.240000000001s)]
*  They're the Republicans. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4541.280000000001s)]
*  The Democrats are just exaggerating people being hurt. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4542.200000000001s)]
*  And they're basically counting on that tactic. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4545.400000000001s)]
*  And then two, they haven't calibrated the true populism. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4548.76s)]
*  I mean, some of the people in their party, [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4553.56s)]
*  actually like Josh Hawley, have, [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4554.76s)]
*  or at least understand why this is- [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4556.92s)]
*  It's silly voting for it. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4558.88s)]
*  Why this is bad. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4560.320000000001s)]
*  He still voted for it, [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4561.360000000001s)]
*  but at least he tried trying to get the child tax rate more. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4562.200000000001s)]
*  At least he gets that this is not smart politics. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4565.599999999999s)]
*  But a lot of the others, [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4569.04s)]
*  they're not even making an effort to do it. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4570.88s)]
*  And they hope sheer rhetoric [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4572.96s)]
*  can defy the reality of the policy. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4575.599999999999s)]
*  That leads me to sort of the next question here, [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4578.76s)]
*  which is, all the polls show this is very unpopular, [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4580.84s)]
*  but they also show that the American people [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4583.24s)]
*  have heard very little about it. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4584.639999999999s)]
*  There was a poll from Priders USA, [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4585.88s)]
*  the Democratic Super PAC, [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4589.28s)]
*  which shows that like a tiny fraction of people [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4590.12s)]
*  could even cite the fact that there were Medicaid cuts [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4591.76s)]
*  in this bill. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4593.88s)]
*  Why do you think it's been so hard to get people's attention [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4595.4800000000005s)]
*  on something as important as this piece of legislation? [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4597.4800000000005s)]
*  I think just for in a short attention environment, [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4601.0s)]
*  there's so much going on. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4604.400000000001s)]
*  There was the bombing in Iran, [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4605.88s)]
*  there's Trump's daily assault on immigrants, [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4608.08s)]
*  there's the issues that people are dealing with [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4612.2s)]
*  in their daily lives. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4616.16s)]
*  And they just look at the headlines on this stuff [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4617.6s)]
*  and they don't really know how it's impacting them. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4620.44s)]
*  And I think that's gonna be the challenge [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4624.24s)]
*  for the Democratic party is we've got two tasks. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4625.759999999999s)]
*  We've got to show how this is actually taking away [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4628.2s)]
*  healthcare for folks and food assistance for folks. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4631.799999999999s)]
*  I have real people being telling these stories [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4634.799999999999s)]
*  and be specific of what it's doing now and the next year [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4637.12s)]
*  so that people know before the elections [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4642.44s)]
*  that here's actually what's happening. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4644.4s)]
*  Because they're gonna keep saying, [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4646.24s)]
*  you're exaggerating, you're lying, [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4647.08s)]
*  see it wasn't nearly as bad. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4649.12s)]
*  And they've of course tried to stack most of the cuts [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4650.76s)]
*  towards the end of the decade. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4653.24s)]
*  And I guess that's sort of my question is how do we, [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4656.400000000001s)]
*  we're heading in these midterms, [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4659.360000000001s)]
*  this should be the central issue of the midterms. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4660.52s)]
*  But the cuts, the damage to most people [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4664.52s)]
*  is theoretical at that point. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4666.88s)]
*  Have you thought about how we make that case [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4668.04s)]
*  in the context of midterms to make sure that people [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4670.16s)]
*  like Dave Valdeo pay for their sins here? [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4671.72s)]
*  So we're just having this conversation, [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4673.64s)]
*  I don't mind revealing it, [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4675.6s)]
*  and it's among the California delegation on text [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4676.64s)]
*  and I said, look, we've got to have someone do the analysis [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4679.72s)]
*  of what cuts are going to happen starting tomorrow [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4683.6s)]
*  up through 2026 by states in anticipation of the freeze [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4687.16s)]
*  on the provider tax, in anticipation of people having [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4691.68s)]
*  to fill out all this extensive paperwork to get benefits. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4695.68s)]
*  And then we've got to find stories of folks like that [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4699.2s)]
*  in Valdeo's district, in Calvert's district, [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4701.4800000000005s)]
*  in Young Kim's district. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4703.52s)]
*  We can't, I think sometimes Democrats campaign too much [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4704.68s)]
*  in abstraction, 17 million kicked off. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4707.8s)]
*  I don't think that connects. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4710.2s)]
*  I think we've got to be like, here's, you know, [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4712.28s)]
*  Susie who's two year old now doesn't have healthcare. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4714.68s)]
*  And by the way, here are the specific people this month [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4718.2s)]
*  who have been affected in Valdeo's district. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4721.88s)]
*  And we've really got to do our homework. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4723.96s)]
*  And I'm going to ask the caucus to try to come up [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4725.72s)]
*  with something so we know the timeline of these cuts [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4728.52s)]
*  and know the specifics in these districts. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4732.2s)]
*  You know, you're a proud progressive, you know, [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4735.24s)]
*  like many proud progressives, you're probably, [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4738.12s)]
*  I imagine you are quite skeptical of austerity politics. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4739.76s)]
*  This bill adds $3 trillion in debt. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4743.44s)]
*  This is a very different environment than other times [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4746.0s)]
*  in which Congress has passed legislation that's unpaid for [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4748.24s)]
*  like during the stimulus act, after the financial crisis [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4751.48s)]
*  of 2008, the rescue package during COVID. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4755.32s)]
*  We're at a time of high interest rates. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4757.92s)]
*  Like there are real consequences to just large numbers [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4759.72s)]
*  of people starting up with debt at this exact moment. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4765.24s)]
*  Is that something you think Democrats should campaign on? [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4769.32s)]
*  Yes, I mean, this is absolutely reckless to have 8% [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4772.92s)]
*  of GDP deficits when you have no external shock. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4779.16s)]
*  I mean, it's one thing when you had the great recession [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4783.639999999999s)]
*  when President Obama came into power [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4785.5599999999995s)]
*  or even the pandemic under Trump and Biden, [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4787.679999999999s)]
*  they had to act or if you have war. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4790.84s)]
*  But right now you've got no external shock. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4793.28s)]
*  You've got, as you put it, high interest rates [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4795.36s)]
*  and the money is for nothing. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4797.639999999999s)]
*  It's going to people who have capital or not investing it. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4799.759999999999s)]
*  We know that the previous Trump tax cuts people [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4803.28s)]
*  didn't increase business investment. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4806.84s)]
*  They sat on their money, they gave stock buybacks, [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4808.24s)]
*  they wiped off debt from corporations. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4810.84s)]
*  So you're not getting anything productive from it. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4812.679999999999s)]
*  And you really run the risk of making all of us poorer [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4816.36s)]
*  as the Fed is forced to buy up these treasuries [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4821.36s)]
*  as people feel that treasuries aren't the best place [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4824.839999999999s)]
*  to invest. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4828.36s)]
*  So it is putting a huge burden on young people. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4829.2s)]
*  And I think ultimately that's really the argument [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4833.2s)]
*  we have to make, which is when you take food away [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4835.5599999999995s)]
*  from people and you take away healthcare, [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4838.32s)]
*  the people you're hurting the most are the kids, right? [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4840.96s)]
*  I mean, it's the poverty trap. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4842.839999999999s)]
*  And so you're taking away investment of the kids. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4845.0s)]
*  You're adding all this debt to these kids, [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4847.719999999999s)]
*  all to basically provide these tax breaks for the wealthy. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4850.4s)]
*  There's like nothing about investing [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4853.639999999999s)]
*  in this country's future. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4855.32s)]
*  All the empty rhetoric about making America great. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4856.36s)]
*  You're really bankrupting America's future [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4858.92s)]
*  just to satisfy the whims of the wealthiest in this country. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4862.28s)]
*  For entirely a short-term benefit. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4866.639999999999s)]
*  It's not even really for gain because we're not, [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4868.88s)]
*  it's not like these are new tax, for the most part, [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4871.5199999999995s)]
*  are new tax cuts that are going to generate growth [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4873.719999999999s)]
*  in the economy. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4875.759999999999s)]
*  They're just keeping the tax cuts that were passed in place, [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4876.599999999999s)]
*  whatever it was six years ago, or seven years ago, [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4879.16s)]
*  that didn't really generate a lot of growth anyway. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4882.24s)]
*  So we're just really screwing the future [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4884.8s)]
*  for a minimal benefit in the present. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4889.0s)]
*  From a purely- [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4891.68s)]
*  Totally agree. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4892.639999999999s)]
*  From a policy-making perspective, it makes zero sense. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4893.72s)]
*  I would just, looking at this thing, [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4896.92s)]
*  it just really is one of the dumbest things [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4899.28s)]
*  I've ever seen Congress pass. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4901.76s)]
*  It just makes no sense why they actually, [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4902.96s)]
*  I know they want to give their tax cuts [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4906.28s)]
*  to their billionaires, and I get that. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4907.4s)]
*  That's obviously very important to them personally. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4909.799999999999s)]
*  It's very important to their donors. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4911.48s)]
*  It's very important to Donald Trump. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4912.44s)]
*  But just the entire thing put together [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4913.759999999999s)]
*  just is a very contradictory exercise. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4915.4s)]
*  They say they want to lower the deficit. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4918.16s)]
*  They add a bunch of trillion dollars to the debt. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4920.28s)]
*  They make recession more likely. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4922.08s)]
*  They cut all the programs people need [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4923.44s)]
*  when recession happens. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4925.32s)]
*  They ran on lowering costs, and this bill, [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4926.799999999999s)]
*  in every way, shape, or form, raises costs for people. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4929.2s)]
*  That's one thing that's going to be, I think, [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4931.639999999999s)]
*  a real challenge for us to explain and show people [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4933.24s)]
*  is how this actually makes their life more expensive. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4935.32s)]
*  And this is a specific act done [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4937.72s)]
*  by these members of Congress, right? [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4939.08s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4940.84s)]
*  I mean, look, it takes away a lot of the subsidies [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4941.68s)]
*  for renewable energy that's going to lead [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4943.36s)]
*  to higher utility costs. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4946.48s)]
*  It takes away funding in terms of good paying jobs. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4948.32s)]
*  I mean, healthcare, look at the jobs report today. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4952.28s)]
*  One of the reasons the jobs report was decent [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4954.12s)]
*  is all the growth has been in healthcare jobs. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4956.5199999999995s)]
*  Who then says, okay, what we're going to do [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4959.08s)]
*  is cut healthcare so that we can have less healthcare jobs. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4961.88s)]
*  And that's the one sector that's generating [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4966.32s)]
*  a good paying jobs and sustaining the economy. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4968.4400000000005s)]
*  So there's a lot in it that is going to impact [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4971.12s)]
*  ordinary people's lives. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4975.6s)]
*  But I think the broader point is that the only coherence [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4976.64s)]
*  that Republicans have that I've seen [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4980.68s)]
*  in my nine years of Congress is tax cuts. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4982.4800000000005s)]
*  Ultimately, I mean, they could dress it up as whatever, [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4984.92s)]
*  populism, working class, we're a new party. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4987.48s)]
*  At the end of the day, there's like one unifying principle. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4991.759999999999s)]
*  They all vote for tax breaks. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4994.36s)]
*  And those tax breaks are always for the wealthiest. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4996.36s)]
*  And their whole goal is let's starve government, [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=4999.44s)]
*  let's get rid of the new deal, [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=5002.08s)]
*  let's just make government smaller. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=5003.5599999999995s)]
*  Who cares about the deficits? [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=5005.839999999999s)]
*  We just want to cut, cut, cut, cut, cut. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=5007.04s)]
*  And I really think that the Democrats just need to go out [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=5009.839999999999s)]
*  there and win the argument to say, [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=5012.759999999999s)]
*  that's mortgaging America's future. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=5015.679999999999s)]
*  That's not gonna help us have kids [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=5017.639999999999s)]
*  who are gonna have good paying jobs and strong families. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=5019.36s)]
*  And that's not what's gonna help us lead against China [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=5022.12s)]
*  or make us a strong nation in the 21st century. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=5024.32s)]
*  And we haven't done enough of that. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=5028.2s)]
*  We haven't argued on the economics, [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=5030.36s)]
*  on our theory of the case about what's gonna make [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=5033.4s)]
*  this country strong. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=5036.28s)]
*  I mean, Obama did, Clinton did, [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=5037.12s)]
*  but we've got to do that again, [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=5039.12s)]
*  the basics of making the case. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hMDEF0y7lk&t=5040.24s)]
