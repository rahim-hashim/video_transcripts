Video Description: The problems dogging attorney general pick Matt Gaetz don't seem to be going away, as new leaks expose a history of thousands of dollars in Venmo payments to two women at the center of the complaints against him. Meanwhile, newly unearthed video of RFK Jr., Trump's choice for health secretary, shows him speculating about whether the Covid pandemic was planned by the government. Tommy is joined by Democratic strategist and media expert Lis Smith to unpack all the chaos, plus what the Dems are missing, what needs to shift in their media strategy, and the big questions driving the race for DNC Chair. Then, Dan sits down with Sen. Jon Tester to reflect on his re-election battle in Montana, how Democrats can win in the heartland again, and the best way to connect with voters in red states.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Trump Nominates Crudite Quack Dr. Oz To Oversee Medicare and Medicaid
**Pod Save America:** [November 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A)
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Tommy Vitor and guest hosting with me today is my friend Liz Smith, one of the smartest [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=0.0s)]
*  Democratic strategists in politics. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=7.2s)]
*  She spent most of this cycle at the DNC heading up their efforts to deal with third-party candidates like our buddy [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=9.82s)]
*  RFK Jr. Liz, welcome. Thank you. Thank you for having me Tommy. I wish it were under better circumstances, but look forward to [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=15.96s)]
*  talking about the dumpster fire in Washington DC with you. Yeah, it's really it's bleak. It's bleak speaking of bleak on today's show [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=23.88s)]
*  We're gonna talk about the latest in the Matt Gaetz for Attorney General saga [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=31.64s)]
*  I'll have the race for DNC chair shaken out and Liz's thoughts on how Democrats can shake things up to win again [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=35.08s)]
*  Especially when it comes to media strategy then Senator John Tester stops by to talk with Dan about his tough race in, Montana [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=40.84s)]
*  How he outperformed the national ticket and how Democrats can win again in the heartland states [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=47.76s)]
*  But first we have a flurry of new cabinet picks that are a continuation of the theme of Donald Trump picking his unqualified [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=53.64s)]
*  Friends to run huge important agencies. Wonderful. We talked on the Tuesday pod about the race for Treasury Secretary [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=60.56s)]
*  Apparently the transition co-chair Howard Lutnick eventually lost that race because he's now been named to be Commerce Secretary [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=68.28s)]
*  We'll here will still have a big role in implementing Trump's tariffs [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=74.8s)]
*  Trump also picked Linda McMahon his other transition co-chair to run the Department of Education [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=77.84s)]
*  McMahon is a longtime ally and donor of Trump's she served as SBA administrator during Trump's first term [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=83.94s)]
*  alongside her husband Vince McMahon, she's the co-founder of [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  WWE she is apparently [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=94.68s)]
*  Doesn't have a lot of qualifications to be in the job, but we'll get to that [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=97.2s)]
*  But the biggest cabinet head-scratcher headline to dates or at least in the last couple days is that Trump nominated dr [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=100.22s)]
*  Oz to be the head of CMS the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=107.14s)]
*  It's worth just spending a second to unpack what CMS does because a lot of people probably don't know and how absurd it is to put [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=112.66s)]
*  Dr. Oz in there the the agency the CMS was described by the New York Times as quote [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=118.41999999999999s)]
*  Probably the most challenging technical policy and political job in government [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=123.86s)]
*  CMS provides coverage to about a hundred and fifty million Americans and by some estimates a quarter of all government spending [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=128.56s)]
*  flows through CMS [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=136.12s)]
*  While dr. Oz is a heart surgeon who also plays a lifestyle guru on daytime TV where he hawks [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=138.12s)]
*  Dubious weight loss cures and analyzes different shapes of poop his government experience [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=145.36s)]
*  He's limited to losing a Senate race to John Federman in 2022 where the lasting mark [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=150.76s)]
*  He made on the electorate was this clip thought it was a grocery shopping [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=156.16s)]
*  I'm at Wagner's and my wife wants some vegetables for true to take right? So here's a broccoli [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=160.76s)]
*  That's two bucks about the ton of broccoli there. There's some asparagus. That's four dollars. Yep carrots [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=167.2s)]
*  That's four more dollars. That's ten dollars of vegetables there and then we need some guacamole. That's four dollars more and [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=175.28s)]
*  She loves salsa. Yeah salsa there six dollars must be as short as her salsa guys [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=183.92s)]
*  That's twenty dollars for crutane. This doesn't include the tequila. I mean, that's outrageous. We got Joe Biden to thank for this [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=189.83999999999997s)]
*  No one has ever made a veggie plate sound weirder [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=197.32s)]
*  Liz any thoughts on this kind of latest group of picks or just on this Trump team generally how it's shaping up? Yeah, I mean [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=200.2s)]
*  Fuck it's fucking terrifying. I really don't want to sugarcoat it [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=208.0s)]
*  Looking and I do work for Adam Schiff and he had a really good point on this sort of crop of candidates [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=212.46s)]
*  Is that yes, they are all unqualified [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=218.9s)]
*  But that's sort of the point here because what Donald Trump is trying to do is to show that he can roll the US Senate [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=222.22s)]
*  That he can get these completely unqualified people through the Senate and if he can get them to do that, they will do literally [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=229.34s)]
*  anything for him [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=237.26000000000002s)]
*  Anything for him [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=238.94s)]
*  And you know what? I think it's troubling for most people for me is yes seeing these people are unqualified and that the main [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=240.5s)]
*  Qualification is their loyalty to Donald Trump the fact that they won't say no and we know from people inside the White House [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=248.29999999999998s)]
*  During the first Trump term that you had people like mad as you had people like John Kelly not perfect guys [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=254.7s)]
*  Whatever, but they were sort of bulwarks [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=261.41999999999996s)]
*  They sort of push back on him and now it doesn't look like Donald Trump will have any checks on the White House any [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=263.86s)]
*  Checks on his worst impulses and I think that's something that should be really scary to people [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=269.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean this is by and large means shaping up to be a team of just loyalists [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=273.86s)]
*  There are some kind of hawkish establishment types Marco Rubio at the State Department [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=277.82s)]
*  Elise Stefanik at the UN but I kind of think Trump doesn't really care about those agencies [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=282.21999999999997s)]
*  He's focused on like Matt Gaetz as Attorney General Pete Hegseth at the Department of Defense [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=286.82s)]
*  Tom Homan as his borders are Stephen Miller deputy chief of staff. These are hardcore [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=292.02s)]
*  Ideologues who believe first and foremost in MAGA and they will do what Trump says when it comes to punishing his enemies [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=298.65999999999997s)]
*  There was a great quote in the bulwark that said [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=305.38s)]
*  All these other Attorney General picks came to Trump and they started talking about like grand legal theories and Matt Gaetz was like [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=308.58s)]
*  Yeah, I'm gonna go over there and chop off some heads and Trump was like cool. I want that guy [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=314.8s)]
*  So, you know not not great stuff as you noted pretty scary [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=318.96s)]
*  Yeah, and I I mean I think with Matt Gaetz especially that was the first one where we were like, oh my god [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=324.2s)]
*  This is like this is real. This is what's happening [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=330.03999999999996s)]
*  And you know, I would just remind people that when we looked at the exits from the election [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=332.08s)]
*  Voters top issues were inflation and the border not like whatever the hell this is [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=339.32s)]
*  And this is sort of this is not acting on any sort of mandate and you know [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=345.32000000000005s)]
*  There's no indication that these guys are being put into lower the price of eggs [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=350.52000000000004s)]
*  or even necessarily to secure the border as much as do mass deportations and [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=355.44s)]
*  That is, you know, ultimately probably some backlash that Trump will have to deal with but you know [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=360.16s)]
*  A lot of us were out there warning that Trump 2.0 would be on a vengeance tour [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=365.58000000000004s)]
*  He would be all about chaos and doing things for his own [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=370.36s)]
*  personal benefit and [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=373.94s)]
*  Choices to date certainly seem that way. Yeah, certainly does. Yeah, I agree with you [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=375.98s)]
*  I think there's a lot of voters would be like I didn't vote for a [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=379.7s)]
*  Military purge of generals who weren't Republicans. That's weird and just just a hammer this this CMS and dr [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=382.3s)]
*  Oz thing a little bit just because I think it matters [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=388.48s)]
*  I mean CMS employees about 6,000 people according to Wall Street Journal the head of CMS oversees the operation and administration of [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=390.48s)]
*  Medicare Medicaid the chips children's health care [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=398.34000000000003s)]
*  Programs it's just this massive management job and they also issue regulations to ensure state governments [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=401.3s)]
*  healthcare providers that reverberate throughout the entire industry and so [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=408.98s)]
*  Lest you think well, certainly dr. Oz will have some adult supervision [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=414.14000000000004s)]
*  No, the guy's gonna report into the Secretary of Health and Human Services who is supposed to be RFK jr [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=417.62s)]
*  So a wildly technical important job that oversees the healthcare of 150 million Americans in the biggest goober imaginable will be running it [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=422.66s)]
*  He can't even you know figure out how to buy a [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=430.26s)]
*  Crudity as he calls it without sounding weird. Yeah, and I'm the RFK jr [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=433.21999999999997s)]
*  Stuff, especially I think is really really troubling I could go on forever about that. Well, let's let's dig into that [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=438.78s)]
*  I think you're right. That's that's very important. So [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=445.74s)]
*  Before we get to RFK [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=448.82s)]
*  I mean there is this drip drip drip of Matt Gaetz news that is driving the news cycle [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=450.26s)]
*  Apparently a hacker got access to a bunch of secure files from lawyers representing witnesses in the gates case [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=454.94s)]
*  Including testimony from someone Gaetz is said to have slept with when she was 17 as well as a corroborating witness account [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=461.06s)]
*  ABC News reported this morning that Gaetz paid more than ten thousand dollars via Venmo PayPal and good old-fashioned checks [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=468.82s)]
*  To two women who later testified to the House Ethics Committee [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=475.65999999999997s)]
*  That report is based on committee documents that ABC was able to get a hold of [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=479.71999999999997s)]
*  And in a fun little side note a lawyer who represented women who testified to the committee about Matt Gaetz [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=484.84s)]
*  Said he flew them to New York to sleep with them [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=490.8s)]
*  Watch him go on Fox News and then they all went out together to see pretty woman on Broadway [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=493.88s)]
*  Liz first question. Do we think Matt Gaetz fancies himself as like the political Richard Gere or had he not seen the movie? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=499.76s)]
*  What do we think happened here? I mean [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=506.32s)]
*  Could he be more of a cartoonish villain? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=508.84s)]
*  I mean, I think the first rule of like, you know hiring sex workers is don't write a check to them [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=511.88s)]
*  Second rule don't don't Venmo them and you know, put the memo as tuition assistance [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=518.92s)]
*  And maybe the third rule is don't take them to the Broadway adaptation of the all-time classic pretty woman about the hooker with a heart [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=524.36s)]
*  of gold [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=532.54s)]
*  I mean you can't you really can't make this stuff up and it shows that this guy like really [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=533.4000000000001s)]
*  has no regard for for [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=540.2800000000001s)]
*  For anything for doing anything appropriately and this is someone who's only [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=543.72s)]
*  interactions with the Justice Department are being investigated by it and it is such a slap in the face [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=547.9200000000001s)]
*  To the process and honestly, it's a real slap in the face to all the Republicans in the US Senate [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=553.48s)]
*  The Donald Trump is gonna ask them to approve someone who is not only [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=558.7600000000001s)]
*  Unqualified but on every level is a red flag for running the DOJ [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=562.3599999999999s)]
*  Yeah top law enforcement position in the land and he's a creep and a scumbag and they all hate him [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=568.3s)]
*  But hey, you're gonna have to vote on him. Um, so the harder question [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=572.9599999999999s)]
*  Beyond how we scored the pretty woman tickets is how much do you think? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=576.4s)]
*  Democrats should focus on this set of allegations that we just talked about versus all the other ways [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=580.4s)]
*  Gates is unqualified for the job and could do damage [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=586.04s)]
*  Well, you know, I heard you guys talking about this the other day on the show [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=588.8399999999999s)]
*  I think was about Pete Hegseth and his tattoos, right? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=591.88s)]
*  Like why on earth out of all the things we could talk about are we obsessing over his freaking tattoos? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=594.92s)]
*  And this is just generally the problem with Donald Trump. It's generally the problem with [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=601.64s)]
*  People he puts up is that there are so many different things you can go at. I think [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=606.8s)]
*  What's gonna be really important with Matt Gates with any of these nominees is to really really really try to stay focused [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=611.52s)]
*  and [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=619.1999999999999s)]
*  Bring it back to okay. Yeah, like all the taking, you know a couple sex workers to pretty woman on Broadway. It's absurd [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=620.64s)]
*  It's ridiculous, but focus on the ways that what he's gonna do is actually gonna hurt real people [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=627.7199999999999s)]
*  And make it about the impacts and like the chaos that he would bring to the DOJ all that stuff that will get the headlines [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=634.4799999999999s)]
*  But we really need to make sure that people understand [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=641.4s)]
*  That this isn't just a partisan back-and-forth about people's you know, very obvious [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=645.08s)]
*  Personal failings. It should be a back-and-forth about why this would make their life worse their life harder and [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=650.24s)]
*  Matt Gates as Attorney General the US is [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=658.36s)]
*  You know a complete vote for chaos. He's a chaos agent. He's going in there [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=661.72s)]
*  as you said to chop off heads for Donald Trump and [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=666.5600000000001s)]
*  That should be terrifying to people and [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=670.12s)]
*  So I think generally my advice there and across the board is we really got a triage focus on the important stuff [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=672.72s)]
*  Don't like just go down every weird rabbit hole with these people [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=678.7600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's right. And I think you know as you and I know because we did communication for so long [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=682.4200000000001s)]
*  I mean the hardest part in these fights is getting it covered in reaching people outside of Washington reaching actual voters [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=687.0400000000001s)]
*  And you know creating a political cost for the the people who you know [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=694.0s)]
*  We'll have to vote for Matt Gates because I think this story [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=698.6800000000001s)]
*  I think it's useful because people are not gonna flip past this one when it gets served to them by like the Daily Mail on [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=701.5600000000001s)]
*  Tik Tok, right? Like you want to know more about what Matt Gates was doing in New York on this trip [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=707.44s)]
*  It's got the details. There's drugs or sex. There's all of it. There's the funny details about yeah [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=711.5200000000001s)]
*  I think you put um in some of the Venmo comments to these women [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=716.1s)]
*  He put in being my friend and then one time you wrote being awesome [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=718.98s)]
*  So thank you for that Matt, but you're right [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=722.82s)]
*  I think you have to use that use that interest in coverage to raise a whole set of broader issues about why he could do [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=724.84s)]
*  Damage and actually harm real people the weird thing about this is like there is this report this morning that some of these files [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=731.0600000000001s)]
*  from an unrelated civil case [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=738.8000000000001s)]
*  against guy Gates were [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=741.24s)]
*  Gotten by a hacker and I'm a little worried about that part of the narrative confusing things [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=743.76s)]
*  I mean like we don't want him to look like a victim [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=749.08s)]
*  We want him to sell a narrative that the deep state is going after him [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=751.2800000000001s)]
*  We also don't know who hacked these files [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=754.44s)]
*  I mean it could be someone who decides [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=756.32s)]
*  He or she wants to dox the women who are victims who apparently yeah gave video testimony [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=758.32s)]
*  So I don't know. I'm hoping this Ethics Committee report will leak but I am a little worried that this are hacking piece of it [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=763.8000000000001s)]
*  Confuses things it always does it always does but [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=771.96s)]
*  I'm with you. I hope they release the ethics investigation. I would be nice if they released it. It didn't have to be leaked [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=776.14s)]
*  so that we could look at all of this, but [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=783.54s)]
*  You know during the hearings all that I think it's just really important to focus on [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=786.1s)]
*  you know the really dangerous things that he would want to do as Attorney General and [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=790.9399999999999s)]
*  he's picked because Trump wants someone who will [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=795.98s)]
*  Not check his worst impulses and do all the things that he said he wanted to do to his political enemies in his first term [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=798.9399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. All right. Let's go to our buddy RFK jr. Deep breaths for both of us [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=805.2199999999999s)]
*  So the bulwark reported yesterday that in a speech given in 2020 [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=810.14s)]
*  RFK seemed open to the idea that the government might have created the kovat pandemic [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=815.9799999999999s)]
*  Let's listen to a clip from that speech [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=821.42s)]
*  Many people argue that this plant pandemic was a planned emic and it was planned from the outset [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=823.42s)]
*  It's part of a senator scheme. I [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=829.56s)]
*  Can't tell you the answer that I don't have enough evidence a lot of it feels very planned to me [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=832.54s)]
*  But I don't know I will tell you this if you create these mechanisms for control [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=838.9s)]
*  They become weapons of obedience [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=846.4599999999999s)]
*  For authoritarian regimes no matter how beneficial or innocent the people who created them [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=849.66s)]
*  So does Trump not notice or care that Robert F Kennedy is accusing him of unleashing the virus? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=856.34s)]
*  So I got that kink over well, right? I know how how weird is that and [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=862.66s)]
*  You know what you saw and what you heard in that clip. It's sort of vintage [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=868.0600000000001s)]
*  RFK jr. And I think you talked about this with brandy on the podcast, which is that [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=872.54s)]
*  You know one he's full of shit this guy manipulates facts things he hears says whatever [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=878.34s)]
*  But to he always tries to frame it in a way of like hey just asking questions just asking questions [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=884.7s)]
*  And you know, he's someone who said just raised questions about whether 9-eleven was an inside job whether the 1993 World Trade Center [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=890.82s)]
*  Bombing was an inside job, you know, whether the pandemic was an inside job apparently perpetrated by the Trump administration in the deep state [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=899.02s)]
*  He said tap water turns kids gay and transgender that [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=907.1s)]
*  No vaccines are safe and effective and you know, the most troubling thing about [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=911.82s)]
*  To me about him is again [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=917.22s)]
*  What I was talking about with you before is the real life impacts of this, right? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=919.5s)]
*  This isn't a guy who just goes out and says irresponsible things. This is someone who was a [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=924.5s)]
*  Lead spreader of misinformation during the pandemic. He profited widely off of that [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=929.74s)]
*  But if you go back to 2018 he was someone who helped stoke this really bad public health crisis in American Samoa [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=934.9s)]
*  where he spread anti [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=941.98s)]
*  Propaganda that was against the measles vaccine and you know what the end effect of that was [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=945.14s)]
*  Dozens and dozens of people there died most of them kids and you know [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=949.9399999999999s)]
*  If you scaled that up for the US that would be you know, I think I saw online [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=954.18s)]
*  130 140 thousand people dead so what he is doing would have really really real-life effects [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=959.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean that I think that's the most important point [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=966.8s)]
*  I mean he could at the bare minimum he could make people more hesitant to get vaccines [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=969.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, reduce the uptick and you know measles vaccinations and lead to a massive outbreak [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=973.6199999999999s)]
*  It's also it's always interesting to me how Trump is never held responsible for the things the government did when he's in charge [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=977.4799999999999s)]
*  It was always the deep state [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=983.4s)]
*  His supporters simultaneously want him to be seen as this all-powerful strong man [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=984.96s)]
*  But also the constant victim and it drives me nuts, but you're right. I mean, I do think these comments [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=989.4200000000001s)]
*  It tells us more than just about our of case vaccine views. It's just a guy who sees conspiracies everywhere [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=993.76s)]
*  It's like antidepressants or mass shootings 5g towers are controlling us [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1000.88s)]
*  HIV doesn't cause AIDS and for that person to be in charge of kind of like [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1007.0s)]
*  Collating and understanding and releasing medical research is very dangerous and you correct me if I'm wrong Liz [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1012.08s)]
*  But I do think that the accent anti-vaccine cause does seem to be like the first second and third thing that he cares about [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1017.72s)]
*  It's like his primary motivation. Yeah, and you know, that's why it's it was really really really frustrating to me in the last week [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1024.52s)]
*  when I saw Governor Jared Polis Democratic governor from Colorado saw [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1033.04s)]
*  Cory Booker Democratic senator from New Jersey coming out and praising the pick and you know largely focusing on [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1037.72s)]
*  how [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1045.56s)]
*  RK jr. Wants to take on chemicals in the food and agribusiness and it's like [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1046.8400000000001s)]
*  You are so freaking naive if you think that RFK jr. Is being picked to take on agribusiness and [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1052.2s)]
*  You are more than naive [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1059.44s)]
*  You're frankly an idiot if you think that Donald Trump is gonna allow anyone in his administration to take on big business to take on [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1061.32s)]
*  agribusiness [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1069.96s)]
*  And [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1072.04s)]
*  This is sort of a smoke screen that that he uses right he goes out and he talks about [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1073.6000000000001s)]
*  Make America healthy again. Let's reduce childhood obesity all that [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1080.0s)]
*  But like that's not what he's about [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1084.76s)]
*  He's not about raw milk the thing [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1086.2s)]
*  The thing that animates him the thing that has enriched him [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1088.48s)]
*  You know the thing that he has made his biggest mark on is on being an anti-vaxxer and it's extremely dangerous [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1091.48s)]
*  And so like I'm begging you Democrats get their stuff together [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1098.68s)]
*  don't go out there and [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1102.76s)]
*  Don't go out there and you know fall for his his make America healthy again stick [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1105.44s)]
*  Children will get sick children will die if this guy brings his anti-vax [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1111.24s)]
*  Mentality to Washington DC and that should be the focus [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1117.36s)]
*  Yeah [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1120.72s)]
*  I mean [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1121.24s)]
*  I think our Robert of Kennedy has just been like a [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1121.56s)]
*  Spokesperson who does a lot of podcasts for many years and now he's in charge of something and so we got to watch what he does [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1124.12s)]
*  Not what he says and I think you're right [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1129.36s)]
*  I mean all of these [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1131.28s)]
*  There were all these articles in the campaign about Trump going to massive corporate interests and saying cut me a huge check and I'll advance [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1132.8s)]
*  Your agenda whether it was you know the people who wanted to undo the work Biden was doing to go after monopolies [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1138.24s)]
*  All the crypto people were thrilled to get rid of Gary Gensler and have no rules never mind that you know [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1145.8s)]
*  Some crypto companies collapse and a bunch of people got hurt [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1151.78s)]
*  I think this is gonna be replicated in every single industry and agency [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1154.4s)]
*  Agriculture GMOs oil and gas I mean the incoming chief of staff Susie Wiles is a lobbyist. Yeah seems to tell you a lot [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1158.92s)]
*  Yeah, and you know just generally going back to how Democrats should handle this, you know [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1165.72s)]
*  You had Cory Booker Jared Polis on one side then I saw Jake Aukenclas [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1170.92s)]
*  You know that he's the congressman from Massachusetts his parents are scientists. He went on he's been going on TV [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1175.72s)]
*  Going on like Twitter thread storms all that just really hammering all of [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1182.0800000000002s)]
*  Rfk jr's most anti science views and dangerous views and I would love to see that sort of discipline from Democrats on this [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1188.64s)]
*  And I am a broken record about this but like Democrats have a great bench. We never use them [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1194.94s)]
*  We always talk about our bench [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1199.7s)]
*  But we never use them and like we know that with these picks it's gonna be an opportunity for [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1200.78s)]
*  Democrats to come out of the woodwork and speak out against them [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1206.06s)]
*  So like when it's a pick like Rfk jr [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1208.44s)]
*  Have Jake Aukenclas have Lauren Underwood who's a nurse talk about this when it's someone like Pete Hegseth have Pat Ryan [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1210.54s)]
*  Who's already been out there on this and have Mikey Cheryl go out and speak out about it? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1217.66s)]
*  But I really really would love to see a coordinated [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1222.52s)]
*  strategic [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1226.24s)]
*  Communications plan around this that is not just treating everyone every [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1227.52s)]
*  Can it like it's a five alarm fire and where we're putting out some voices who I think would be really respected [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1232.24s)]
*  I think that's really smart [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1237.32s)]
*  I think we ought to be very focused on the messengers and their credibility and and you know [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1238.4s)]
*  How the impact of their words on the voters but also to your point be strategic about the fights we pick because [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1242.1200000000001s)]
*  Like the end goal the real goal is to get four [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1248.4s)]
*  Republican senators to vote against a pick or to privately tell Trump to pull the NAMI. I'm pretty skeptical that will happen [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1251.2800000000002s)]
*  so the secondary goal is create a process and a narrative and a bunch of stories that create some political damage for Trump and [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1258.0800000000002s)]
*  Like you said, I think it's a trap to just go nuts on every nominee because we sound [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1266.0400000000002s)]
*  hyperbolic and like I think we also can't frame our [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1271.96s)]
*  Arguments as we're the defenders of the status quo and he's a disruptor because a lot of people want that and we also have to [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1275.6599999999999s)]
*  Focus on things that people care about I mean you mentioned the tattoo thing with Pete Hegseth [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1282.5s)]
*  My other hobby horse on this is Tulsi Gabbard who should not be the next director of national intelligence [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1287.1s)]
*  But everyone's calling her like Putin's puppet and a stooge and this yeah [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1293.02s)]
*  And it's like I don't know that sounds very like 2017 Mueller time shit [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1296.3s)]
*  Like let's talk about how she has no qualifications. She's never managed a big organization [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1301.22s)]
*  She's never worked in the intelligence community. I think like we got to be a little more substantive here. Yeah, I'm with you on that one [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1305.6599999999999s)]
*  I mean looks she's done stuff like met with Bashar al-assad and has said things that do mirror some of Kremlin talking points [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1311.36s)]
*  But there's no evidence that she's a you know Kremlin asset or anything like that. And I think the second we start saying things like that [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1320.02s)]
*  we lose [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1326.7s)]
*  credibility and [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1328.46s)]
*  what we saw during the first Trump term is [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1330.02s)]
*  If everything is a fire alarm fire if everything is World War three then like nothing and ends up mattering and like when World War three [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1332.18s)]
*  Actually comes along people just be like, yeah, sure. Sure. You're the boy who cried wolf [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1339.46s)]
*  And so I really really really would like to see a much more [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1344.3400000000001s)]
*  Disciplined approach this time around and not just throwing out, you know the worst [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1349.42s)]
*  accusations against people the most incendiary language [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1355.3400000000001s)]
*  Just because it will get you uncomfortable [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1359.26s)]
*  Because it will get you on cable right? Let's be strategic about how we handle these things [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1361.3s)]
*  Exactly. We don't want to go into just full-time MSNBC voice [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1365.42s)]
*  I mean, I think it's enough to say like Tulsi Gabbard flew to Syria to meet with Assad in 2017 [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1368.5s)]
*  That was six years into him massacring his people. She doesn't have to be a Putin stooge [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1373.34s)]
*  I mean like it's okay to meet with people you disagree with but then she defended him and claimed that Assad didn't use chemical weapons [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1377.66s)]
*  People yeah. Yeah. Yeah that in itself enough. She was qualifying, you know, the Russians invade Ukraine [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1383.74s)]
*  She blames the Ukrainians for NATO expansion. We can debate whether NATO expansion was a good idea [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1389.74s)]
*  But like certainly this was just an act of naked aggression by the Russians [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1394.22s)]
*  Okay, but let's turn to the Democrats because you had a ringside seat to this whole cycle [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1398.38s)]
*  Through Biden through Harris. I want to talk to you about your diagnosis of where things went wrong broadly [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1403.94s)]
*  But also there's been this kind of media debate. There's this dumb, you know thing about Democrats need their own Joe Rogan [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1410.7s)]
*  That's a little silly but clearly we need a new strategy what what in your in broad strokes you think that strategy entails [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1417.18s)]
*  first and foremost meeting voters where they are [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1424.1399999999999s)]
*  And it means meeting them where they are on issues and meeting them where they are in terms of where they're getting their news [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1428.46s)]
*  on the issue on the matter of issues I [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1434.98s)]
*  worked on Tom Swazee special election in February of last year and I thought it was gonna be like sort of a good harbinger of like [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1438.6599999999999s)]
*  Where things would go? [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1445.04s)]
*  And he was able to win a tough race that you know [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1447.28s)]
*  National-republicans poured millions and millions of dollars in and that Democrats probably should have lost because the number one issue was immigration [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1452.16s)]
*  Rather than just like changing the subject and saying no, let's only talk about abortion. Let's only talk about democracy [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1460.72s)]
*  Tom leaned into immigration and he went on the offensive on it and flipped the script and said, you know what? [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1466.64s)]
*  I want a bipartisan border bill. I'll give you some stuff [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1472.3200000000002s)]
*  I'll give you a little bit of a wall if you want and then I don't need everything in return [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1475.28s)]
*  But then the Republican said went along with Trump said no no border deal [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1479.92s)]
*  No border bill and we just hammered her every single day and said that you know, Tom wants a secure border [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1484.3200000000002s)]
*  his opponent wants chaos because she Donald Trump think will help them at the border and [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1492.68s)]
*  He ended up winning by eight points crazy blowout and [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1498.6399999999999s)]
*  It at the time people were saying okay. This is gonna be a model for what Democrats should do [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1502.56s)]
*  It was disappointing to see that people didn't take that a lot of people didn't take that [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1508.6399999999999s)]
*  And what we saw in the exit polls are top issues for Democrat for voters writ large were inflation costs [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1514.76s)]
*  and the border and [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1521.6399999999999s)]
*  National Democrats who didn't talk about the border paid a price [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1523.84s)]
*  National Democrats are going around talking about by dynamics like it was a good thing and everything is great [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1526.6799999999998s)]
*  What are you talking about GDP stock market? [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1531.52s)]
*  Everyone's employed the economy is great like couldn't have sounded more out of touch [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1534.6399999999999s)]
*  And what I would do and what I would encourage people to do [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1538.4399999999998s)]
*  I did work with a lot of these candidates is to look at look to the people who won [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1541.8799999999999s)]
*  You know, Tom did the great stuff on immigration in the special in general [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1545.6399999999999s)]
*  But then look at Pat Ryan look at Marie glues and camp Perez. Look at Angie Krebs [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1549.4799999999998s)]
*  Look at Jared golden. These were all of the top over performers of the cycle [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1555.72s)]
*  What are the things that they all did one they all ran ads saying we need to secure the border [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1561.0800000000002s)]
*  They all ran ads on costs and how they want to lower them [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1566.76s)]
*  They all made sure to try to localize the race versus getting trapped up in nationals up [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1571.28s)]
*  And you know, some of them did a really really good job [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1576.0s)]
*  And it's a fraught debate of like really blunting Republicans attacks on trans issues and that's something I think that we need to figure out going forward is how [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1579.6s)]
*  We do not let the Republicans use that as a cudgel [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1588.6799999999998s)]
*  Against Democrats, but more so than just like criticizing Democrats [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1593.1999999999998s)]
*  I want us to look at these candidates who overperformed in these Trump districts and [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1596.6399999999999s)]
*  Let's also look at Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin. Let's look at Ruben Gallego in Arizona [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1602.04s)]
*  How are they able to listen to Slotkin in Michigan and a lot of the things I mentioned with the [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1606.44s)]
*  Candidates that I did some work with [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1611.88s)]
*  Apply to them as well. Yeah, I mean Alyssa Slotkin is one I was thinking about as you were talking because she was repeatedly attacked as [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1614.88s)]
*  Kamala Harris was over [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1622.16s)]
*  The policy of the electric vehicle mandates. So basically phasing out, you know gas-powered cars and going to EVs [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1624.8000000000002s)]
*  Slotkin put up this ad in October at some point who was like look I don't support an EV mandate [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1631.76s)]
*  I want to build the EVs here in Michigan [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1636.8000000000002s)]
*  But I'm not gonna force you to drive one and she I think pretty successfully blunted those attacks [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1639.8400000000001s)]
*  But at the presidential level, I'm not sure that they ever responded directly on that issue [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1643.68s)]
*  Similarly anyone who watched, you know football or sports or generally saw millions of dollars worth these [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1648.68s)]
*  Disgusting anti-trans ad there there were no there was no response [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1655.5200000000002s)]
*  From the Harris campaign in terms of paid media and there's a lot of reporting about why apparently they cut some ads [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1660.1200000000001s)]
*  They didn't test well [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1665.3600000000001s)]
*  But also she never took the issue on directly or made the affirmative case for for what she believes and why she's you know [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1666.56s)]
*  Fighting for trans rights and you know [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1673.6000000000001s)]
*  So and I think when you leave a vacuum like that you get hurt similar like Ruben Gallego did some really smart things [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1675.24s)]
*  To over perform the Harris campaign with Latino voters and you're right. I mean do you think you have to look to these [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1681.24s)]
*  Successful races to learn something and you know [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1686.4s)]
*  Part of the issue I think with the trans [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1690.64s)]
*  Debate is a lot of people are uncomfortable talking about it [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1692.78s)]
*  they're uncomfortable that they're gonna say something wrong and like get canceled or [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1695.44s)]
*  it's just something that they don't feel comfortable talking about and I [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1700.0s)]
*  Really do think that there is a playbook for Democrats here that doesn't involve, you know throwing trans kids under the bus [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1704.24s)]
*  I saw it in 2022 when I you know worked with Mallory McMurray [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1710.76s)]
*  In Michigan and she became sort of an overnight star on this issue [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1715.92s)]
*  There the Republicans really really overreach on the issue on trans issues [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1720.76s)]
*  You had the Republican candidate for governor running like a hundred percent ads on this [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1725.68s)]
*  Then when reporters went to her and said, okay, can you identify any? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1731.08s)]
*  Trans girls playing in girls sports in the state. She couldn't find a single one [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1735.68s)]
*  So what Democrats are able to do there was to say one it's super weird that this is what you're focused on [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1740.32s)]
*  And two you're only doing this because you don't have any solutions you want to talk about on lowering health care costs on [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1747.12s)]
*  Inflation on any of those things and then you know this cycle. I saw Marie glues in Camp Perez handled this very well [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1754.76s)]
*  Her opponent Joe Kent tried to attack her for not supporting a federal ban on this and she was like Joe [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1762.24s)]
*  You know what? I'm not the weirdo. You're the weirdo [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1767.92s)]
*  You're the one who supports a bill that would require genital checks on girls as young as five years old and [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1770.8400000000001s)]
*  Let's leave this to local governments [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1777.92s)]
*  Let's leave this to local school districts to parents to communities to figure out like let's not have this big government [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1780.16s)]
*  Overreach that is gonna end up with genital checks for young girls [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1786.44s)]
*  And I feel like the more we can make it like they're the weirdos [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1789.88s)]
*  They're rationally obsessed with it the better when they make it that were for they them and not for you [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1793.82s)]
*  That's where I think we lose. Yeah, I think that's right. There's a libertarian argument [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1800.22s)]
*  That's like the government should stay out of my kids, you know locker room [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1804.66s)]
*  There's also just a cruelty argument like why why do you spend all of your time tens of millions of dollars focused on attacking kids? [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1809.0800000000002s)]
*  Like what's the upside in that? [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1814.6200000000001s)]
*  and [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1817.1000000000001s)]
*  You're right, though [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1818.46s)]
*  I just do think we have to join the fight be a part of that conversation make an affirmative case point out how [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1819.22s)]
*  Craven and politicize what they're doing is and make that part of the argument [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1824.94s)]
*  But I also want to talk to you about this um this media piece of it because I know you obsess about it [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1828.88s)]
*  I was reading this Wall Street Journal P. I obsess about it, too [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1833.6200000000001s)]
*  I was reading the Wall Street Journal the other day [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1836.44s)]
*  They reported that Trump's interview with Joe Rogan had 25 million listens on Spotify in [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1838.94s)]
*  45 million views on YouTube so while we Democrats were debating whether or not it was okay to go on his show [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1845.54s)]
*  Trump was there putting up like Super Bowl numbers for his interview [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1851.58s)]
*  And so it just it speaks to the fact that like we don't need a new Joe Rogan [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1855.54s)]
*  But we need to rethink our media strategy and go on Joe Rogan and debate him and push back on him when he advances [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1858.6399999999999s)]
*  You know anti-trans views right you fight them you argue and you win you win the debate [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1864.2s)]
*  And I also think like we need to shift away [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1868.54s)]
*  From cable news a bit or at least not I feel like a lot of [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1871.54s)]
*  politicians don't feel like they actually [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1875.86s)]
*  Achieve something unless they have a cable news hit about their topic and the reality is the viewership is going way down [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1878.06s)]
*  People are spending more time on tik-tok and social platforms and yes [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1883.82s)]
*  podcasts our friend Peter Hanby wrote up some interesting polling for puck news that said [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1888.02s)]
*  14% of voters said they learned information about Kamala Harris from a podcast [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1893.62s)]
*  23% said they heard about news about Trump from a podcast and those who heard about Trump on a podcast [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1898.34s)]
*  55% said it influenced their vote so again like clearly this is a podcast we're talking on right now [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1905.3s)]
*  I'm a self-interested person at crooked media [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1912.14s)]
*  But like we have to think of these alternatives and build out these ecosystems because we're losing cable [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1914.34s)]
*  Social media is tilting towards the right right like Elon's fully magified [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1920.66s)]
*  Twitter [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1925.98s)]
*  Facebook Instagram threads they all de-emphasize political content. God knows how the tick-tock algorithm works [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1927.5s)]
*  So like we have to find people probably on YouTube going forward. Yeah, so we can build our own ecosystem [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1934.06s)]
*  I think that's part of it [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1940.24s)]
*  But when I hear people say we need to our own Joe Rogan, I want to be like [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1942.54s)]
*  Like what the hell man, it's so clear. You have never listened to Joe Rogan Joe Rogan. It's not a political show [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1946.58s)]
*  You know before I had a kid I used to listen to Joe Rogan a lot like his interviews got me through the pandemic [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1953.3s)]
*  Like if you've never listened to his interview with Mike Tyson, like you really haven't lived it is gold [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1960.06s)]
*  But I listened to it because I wanted to like listen to stuff that wasn't political [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1965.86s)]
*  And so I could hear him chopping it up with like Mike Tyson or with like, I don't know Miley Cyrus. I am [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1970.8999999999999s)]
*  Andrew Schultz. I heard the Miley Cyrus one actually that's pretty good. Yeah, right [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1977.46s)]
*  And [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1981.64s)]
*  So like I would be in the pandemic [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1982.64s)]
*  I would be going for walks in the woods and that's what I would listen to and but like the [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1984.56s)]
*  So one I think it's a problem that people on our side don't listen to Joe Rogan don't understand that sort of that sort of [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1989.36s)]
*  You know that sort of sphere right and they think that okay, we need someone on the left [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=1997.32s)]
*  It's not a political show what I think we need is people who can go on shows like Joe Rogan and to your point [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2001.7s)]
*  And what does that mean that means people can have actual conversations and sometimes I think this is a challenger challenge [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2008.48s)]
*  especially for older politicians Donald Trump is a little bit of an anomaly, but is [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2014.92s)]
*  They're so used to talking like talking points and and policies that it's hard for them [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2020.24s)]
*  Just to go on and like chop it up and have a normal conversation [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2025.16s)]
*  And I thought that was a little bit of a missed opportunity with Kamala Harris when she went on caller daddy [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2028.92s)]
*  Is that it was like so policy focused and it's like it should have been more [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2034.96s)]
*  What the usual programming of caller daddy is and obviously you're gonna tame it down a little bit [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2040.76s)]
*  You're not gonna be asking her a lot of the questions that Alex Hoover asked asked her a guess [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2046.0s)]
*  But I do think we need to people who can go on there and not to like play purity politics with the podcast [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2052.88s)]
*  Right, like just because you go on Joe Rogan [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2057.8s)]
*  It doesn't mean you endorses positions on you trans girls and in girls sports, you know, just because you go on barstool [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2060.38s)]
*  It doesn't mean that you endorse everything that like Dave Portnoy or whoever has said when you [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2067.86s)]
*  Try to purify yourself like this [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2075.26s)]
*  You just end up cutting yourself off from a huge audience [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2077.02s)]
*  They would never otherwise reach and if you look at the demographics of who is on of who listens to [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2079.76s)]
*  Rogan right it is very diverse very diverse ideologically. It's about a third a third a third Republican Democrat independent [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2087.1800000000003s)]
*  very racially [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2094.9s)]
*  Diverse and it's a lot of young men and these are people who will basically do everything in their power not to have to listen to MSNBC [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2097.34s)]
*  Consume political news. And so like this is the only way you're gonna reach them and why on earth [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2104.7000000000003s)]
*  Are we not trying to reach them there? [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2109.9s)]
*  But to do it and do it effectively we need candidates who can go on have those conversations [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2111.66s)]
*  and to me it speaks to the need for like [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2118.02s)]
*  younger fresher more normal voices, I always say more normal Democrats and [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2121.7s)]
*  You know people who can go beyond just like [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2129.14s)]
*  Policy talking points. Yeah, the diversity of experience [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2132.46s)]
*  Yes gender, but also like, you know, some people that didn't go to college, right? [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2135.8599999999997s)]
*  Like people like Dan Osborne right talking from a different perspective [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2139.0s)]
*  I mean, yeah, you're right Trump is an anomaly his superpower is that you can talk about himself non-stop all day every day [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2141.4s)]
*  I heard Rogan joking that Trump walked in didn't use the bathroom [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2146.6s)]
*  Talked for three hours left without using the bathroom and that was the most shocking thing you've ever seen [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2150.72s)]
*  But like like broader more broadly [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2155.84s)]
*  There is this big kind of rolling fight about why Kamala Harris lost and people are pointing to their different things [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2158.34s)]
*  And I think ultimately like everything points to anger about the economy and inflation and Joe Biden being very unpopular being like the main [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2164.3199999999997s)]
*  Cause but that doesn't mean that Harris couldn't have done things differently [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2172.68s)]
*  And I do think it's probably a mistake to wait so long to do long-form interviews [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2176.2799999999997s)]
*  That also seems to have kept Tim Walls from doing things early on [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2181.0s)]
*  And you're right. It means going on shows where you know people disagree with us [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2185.8799999999997s)]
*  It also means like we can't spend another cycle spending half a billion dollars on TV ads that don't work. Oh my god [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2190.42s)]
*  Yeah, and one other thing I would say I mean I could go on about this for hours [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2197.14s)]
*  It's like my passion, you know [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2201.72s)]
*  I wrote a book that any given Tuesday that went through a lot of this [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2202.98s)]
*  But this is how we got Pete to go from people to judge to go from [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2207.22s)]
*  security to a top-tier candidate like [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2210.98s)]
*  We but like what it was was like people sometimes focus on the go-everywhere [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2213.14s)]
*  Aspects like sort of the non-traditional stuff that we did like Dazis and marrow the Breakfast Club [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2218.42s)]
*  Bar stool all of that [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2222.86s)]
*  but what we really actually did was an all of the above strategy and I do think that that's something that [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2224.7000000000003s)]
*  Can I saw a little bit left behind with both Biden and Harris is that? [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2232.0200000000004s)]
*  By the end they were complaining so much about the refs like the New York Times Washington Post all that [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2236.1800000000003s)]
*  You've got to work the refs as well. You know throw some stuff their way [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2241.2200000000003s)]
*  Give them like what's the harm in giving New York Times a five-minute pull aside or Washington Post a five-minute minute pull aside [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2245.7000000000003s)]
*  Give them that do a little cable do a little network news [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2252.3s)]
*  Hit all the local stuff that you can hit the non-traditional stuff and and like if you do all of those things together [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2255.94s)]
*  That is how you're most likely to reach people people who are regular voters people who are not regular voters [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2263.34s)]
*  People have different political persuasions and it's also how you're more likely to get the press off your ass [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2270.02s)]
*  Yes, and I really think it's important as much as we roll our eyes at the [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2275.3399999999997s)]
*  declining influence of the mainstream media [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2281.02s)]
*  It's really important that to understand. Yeah, you still got to work those refs a little bit [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2283.2599999999998s)]
*  you got to work those refs and boy you and I have been on the campaign plane where you have a [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2287.62s)]
*  Press office or a press plane full of really pissed off reporters and it does not help you win [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2292.54s)]
*  Last thing I want to talk about was the race to succeed Jamie Harrison as DNC chair [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2297.38s)]
*  the former governor Martin O'Malley who currently runs the Social Security Administration who you worked for [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2301.78s)]
*  Forever ago has declared as a candidate [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2308.02s)]
*  So as Ken Martin who's the head of the Democrat farm labor party in Minnesota state party chair there other potential candidates include Ben [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2310.26s)]
*  Wickler the head of Wisconsin Democrats who we've talked to a million times on the show and is great [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2318.04s)]
*  Michigan State Senator Mallory McMurray who's [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2323.1s)]
*  Excellent went viral a couple years ago who I know you've worked for as well and then former New York congressman Max Rose [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2326.1s)]
*  So, you know you just mentioned that you worked with Pete [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2332.2999999999997s)]
*  Including when he was running for DNC chair [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2335.7s)]
*  Question is like how important you think this job is and and how important do you think? [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2339.3399999999997s)]
*  You know the the position will be going forward, you know every four years or every eight years [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2343.52s)]
*  We spend a ton of time on this [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2349.18s)]
*  And there's so much attention. This is about the future the party and then the DNC chair sort of fades away [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2351.7000000000003s)]
*  But I think it's a healthy debate for us to have but I do think a lot of people like people who don't live and breathe politics [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2358.7400000000002s)]
*  Don't actually know how the process works, which is like this is not like the bigger broader Democratic Party [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2366.5s)]
*  This is on voters who get to vote on it [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2371.96s)]
*  I think of this is like sort of like the most consequential student student body election. Yeah [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2374.08s)]
*  That you could have it's 440 insiders [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2381.32s)]
*  and [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2385.04s)]
*  When you're running for chair, you're mostly making calls to a lot of these people state party chairs [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2386.2s)]
*  DNC members and the conversations you have with them aren't necessarily about the future of the party and strategy. It's like [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2392.0s)]
*  Okay, are you gonna get this funding for my state party? [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2399.08s)]
*  Are you gonna get this stuff and all of that and [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2401.56s)]
*  That stuff is very very important. But I with this chairman election [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2404.32s)]
*  or chairwoman election, I should say I [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2409.2s)]
*  Was enthused to see Mallory in the conversation. I don't know if she'll actually run or anything like that, but I [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2413.68s)]
*  Think it gets to you know, what kind of face we want to put forward for the party [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2421.68s)]
*  What's the kind of vibe we want to put forward for the party and like again, I'm broken record we need more next-generation [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2428.06s)]
*  Like like gerontocracy has not been kind to the Democratic Party we need people who are badass communicators [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2436.06s)]
*  She she is so good at this stuff [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2442.8199999999997s)]
*  But like we need someone like her who I don't know if you guys have seen this but and I would encourage you [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2446.18s)]
*  Listeners to check this out is she's been doing this series of QA on Instagram where she just takes [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2451.2599999999998s)]
*  Whatever question and then answers it and it's direct-to-camera. No bells and whistles [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2456.74s)]
*  And it's not a lot of spin. It's not a lot of talking points [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2462.34s)]
*  It's just like talking about why yes, you should have Thanksgiving dinner with your [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2465.94s)]
*  Trump family members with your family members who vote for Trump why yes Democrats do need to go on [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2470.7s)]
*  on Rogan and and I think it is sort of a breath of fresh air and like [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2477.1s)]
*  Having someone again who is like more of a normal person can talk like a normal person who's younger who has been in the trenches [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2481.3399999999997s)]
*  And I think could lead the party in a different direction would be good. I also think yes, there's the media money piece [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2488.8999999999996s)]
*  but we do need someone as well who can sort of [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2496.74s)]
*  manage the guts of the DNC the staff all the meetings the state parties and [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2500.18s)]
*  It could be interesting to have more of like a dual chair system like we've had in the past versus just putting it all on [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2505.58s)]
*  One person. Yeah, like an executive director and then a chair. Yeah. I totally agree with you. I want someone young [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2511.5s)]
*  I want someone who didn't doesn't look like they're learning about tick-tock for the first time as they write one [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2516.2999999999997s)]
*  We will probably figure out this race in late February [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2522.06s)]
*  So you're right [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2525.8199999999997s)]
*  It'll be a contest until then and then I agree that it'll just sort of be someone who operates in the background [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2526.3599999999997s)]
*  It does media. I mean the DNC race [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2531.22s)]
*  Similar to what you was it been described to me as like a tiny City Council race where the voters are all Democratic Party [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2533.98s)]
*  Institutionalists your win number is like 225 people. So you're right. It's very small [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2540.46s)]
*  The thing I think everyone just needs to remember is the DNC is not a policymaking organization [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2545.74s)]
*  they're the [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2553.18s)]
*  Organization that keeps the voter file up to date and they acquire [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2554.58s)]
*  Technology that lets us model voters and reach them in better ways. They raise a ton of money [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2558.86s)]
*  And then make sure that money gets to state parties. I also think you know, there will be this big communications push [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2565.1800000000003s)]
*  To deal with Trump and I want the next chair to be someone who's thinking about communications in a different way and not thinking that [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2572.66s)]
*  Going on meet the press once a month is how you combat Trump. It has to be this like digital first [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2580.5s)]
*  Focus but yeah, I mean it'll I'm glad there's a bunch of people jumping in the race. I'm glad there's some outsiders [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2586.54s)]
*  But this person's got to be respected. They'll have to be able to bring everyone together [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2592.78s)]
*  Convene everyone make real decisions be creative and then just raise a shitload of money, right and be strategic [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2597.1800000000003s)]
*  And I do want someone who's thinking about the longer-term democratic brand how we and specifically how we respond to Trump we [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2604.98s)]
*  Voter send a message. We cannot just be an anti Trump party [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2613.3399999999997s)]
*  So I don't know. Let's see how the field shakes out. I like it. Okay, we're gonna take a quick break [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2617.2599999999998s)]
*  But when we come back you're gonna hear Dan's conversation with Senator John Tester about his race in Montana that unfortunately went the wrong way [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2621.98s)]
*  But also about where the party is headed and how we can win states like Montana going forward one quick thing before we do that [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2629.8599999999997s)]

*  Well, look [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2824.38s)]

*  I mean, it's just a fact of life. Every one of my races have been very very close and I [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2828.94s)]
*  Anticipated this one would be close, but I did anticipate I was gonna win this but it didn't turn out to be look [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2834.42s)]
*  And it's it's it's it's for a lot of reasons and we may get into those reasons as we have our conversation here [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2840.46s)]
*  but but in the end I can tell you that things in government don't happen without good people in government and [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2846.46s)]
*  This is the greatest country in the world not because the work that I've done but because the work the previous generations have done to give [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2854.3s)]
*  me opportunity to be successful and and that's the same that's the same [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2860.1000000000004s)]
*  Perspective that I gave to this job [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2866.9s)]
*  It was to make it make this country remain the greatest country in the world [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2869.06s)]
*  Which it is the greatest country has ever existed and can make it so our kids and our grandkids could have the same opportunity that my [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2872.82s)]
*  grandparents and parents gave me in my generation and [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2878.82s)]
*  And I think that that's it now I was finally to a position [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2881.54s)]
*  Where I had enough experience where I was chairing key committees and making [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2886.7799999999997s)]
*  Really important decisions for how the country was going to proceed forward [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2891.7799999999997s)]
*  but the voters spoke and [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2895.5s)]
*  And and that's the way it is and I had a very very good run the United States Senate [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2898.54s)]
*  Spent 18 years here met some great people both inside government and outside government people that I wouldn't normally meet if I had not had [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2904.06s)]
*  This job had an opportunity to do some great things [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2910.8s)]
*  For our veterans for infrastructure for conservation for our public lands for for our financial system that I think is important that will stand the test of time [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2914.32s)]
*  But in the end and I think I may have told you this or you may have read this [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2923.84s)]
*  The best job I ever had is being a farmer and that's the job I'm going back to and so don't feel bad for me [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2928.96s)]
*  I get to go back to something that I really love and we're going to continue to do moving forward and hopefully God willing [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2936.5s)]
*  we'll be able to do it for a number of years if not decades moving forward and then and [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2942.66s)]
*  Then you know we'll monitor government and try to hold people accountable the best we can from from my ability being a farmer [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2948.34s)]
*  West of big sandy, Montana going from the Senate to farming is probably the only [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2954.74s)]
*  Transition to farming where you're gonna have less shit in your life that [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2959.18s)]
*  I [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2962.5s)]
*  Well, let's we get some more livestock and that's right fair enough fair enough [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2963.7000000000003s)]
*  Let's talk a little bit about your race this was always gonna be a tough race Montana is an incredibly Republican state [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2969.54s)]
*  Trump ended up winning by about 20 points you [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2976.2200000000003s)]
*  Did very you know you want a big chunk of Trump's voters [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2981.5s)]
*  What were sort of the big issues in the race and where was sort of the headwinds you were facing? Well, I [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2984.54s)]
*  Think the first one [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2989.7400000000002s)]
*  Well the issues people were talking about were inflation cost of living [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2992.2599999999998s)]
*  They were talking about cost of housing [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2996.9799999999996s)]
*  they were talking about the border and [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=2999.8799999999997s)]
*  And the fact that it should be secure [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3002.3399999999997s)]
*  I [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3005.7s)]
*  Think those were the big issues that I heard as I went around the state of Montana for the last [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3007.18s)]
*  Well, you know for the last two three years actually and it didn't just happen in the last year [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3011.74s)]
*  it's been that way for a bit and [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3016.8599999999997s)]
*  And I think that those are issues that [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3019.86s)]
*  We could have done a better job addressing [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3023.82s)]
*  At the national level we tried that we tried to talk about the things that I was doing specifically in housing and in food [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3027.3s)]
*  Whether that message got through [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3033.86s)]
*  Obviously it didn't get through as much as I wanted to is we lost but but we talked about that [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3036.3s)]
*  We talked about my positions on the southern border, which was different than than the administration's for [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3041.3s)]
*  You know for the first two three four years of the administration so [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3046.3s)]
*  But the bottom line is that's that's what people were concerned about they were concerned about the cost of living and and the border [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3051.1800000000003s)]
*  I would say more specifically now you obviously [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3057.38s)]
*  Were very influential senator you delivered a lot for your state is particularly in the first two years of the Biden administration [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3061.1000000000004s)]
*  The president in Congress did a lot to help the economy and Montana [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3069.3s)]
*  Are there any you know was it hard to break through? [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3072.86s)]
*  Sort of the national issues to be able to talk about the stuff that mattered to Montanans a hundred hundred percent [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3076.2200000000003s)]
*  it was it was very hard to break through the national brand and [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3082.38s)]
*  You know, I was I was asked, you know, you know, you ran 13 points. How the how the president how did you do that? [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3087.78s)]
*  And we did that by talking about who I am as an individual not who I am as a national Democrat [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3095.34s)]
*  And in fact, you know this Dan we did not bring anybody to the state of Montana [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3101.42s)]
*  Now I haven't that by that's the way it was and virtually every election with exception at Jim Webb and my my first re-elect in 12 [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3105.82s)]
*  But we didn't we didn't bring national Democrats to Montana [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3113.2200000000003s)]
*  Why because we didn't want this to be about the National Party [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3117.7000000000003s)]
*  We wanted this to be about John Tester and Montana and how we keep Montana the greatest state the greatest country in the world [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3120.6600000000003s)]
*  And that's why we focused I think if we'd have focused on bringing in national Democrats [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3127.0600000000004s)]
*  I don't think our margin would have been where it is now if you lose by one you still lost but the truth is is that [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3132.6200000000003s)]
*  we knew that the national brand of Democrats right now was not something that was going to work for me in Latina and [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3139.02s)]
*  We knew we had to make sure that folks saw me as [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3147.54s)]
*  John Tester the the third generation dirt farmer from from Big Sandy, Montana [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3151.18s)]
*  And by the way, you know how much money was spent in this election. Probably. I mean it was it was gobs [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3157.54s)]
*  It was over a quarter of a billion dollars [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3163.54s)]
*  and I think they were able to [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3165.54s)]
*  Make me into something. I wasn't and I've told people from the beginning [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3168.46s)]
*  they can't beat John Tester the farmer from Big Sandy the guy that that believes in and on our [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3172.1s)]
*  Liberties and and our privacies but they can they can beat the guy that they talk about [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3178.5s)]
*  Well that guy's for an open border, which I wasn't or that guy's for illegal immigrants from [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3184.46s)]
*  Wanting them to vote which I wasn't and these guys are for making sure that white farmers don't give benefits [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3189.74s)]
*  These were all ads were run by the way and nauseam which I wasn't but they were able to pound that message through [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3195.06s)]
*  And it's one of the reasons I believe strongly and I think this is a bipartisan issue that we need to do something [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3201.02s)]
*  with the amount of money that's in these damn campaigns because [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3206.7400000000002s)]
*  It allows candidates to go into bunkers for months before an election and not even go out and see people [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3210.2200000000003s)]
*  allows them so they don't have to do town hall meetings and [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3215.82s)]
*  And quite frankly it allows a message by the way [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3218.98s)]
*  Which TV stations used to be take down if ads were found patently false now [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3221.94s)]
*  They don't if you give them the money, they'll put anything up virtually and and quite frankly it allows them to [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3226.68s)]
*  Make the candidate into something that they're not and [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3233.2599999999998s)]
*  And I think we suffered from all those things the National Brown stuff the amount of money come in [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3236.8999999999996s)]
*  Look, we had a ton of money on our side, too [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3242.18s)]
*  So I'm not complaining about that [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3243.8199999999997s)]
*  But the truth is it would have been much better to have many many more debates [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3245.6s)]
*  It would have been much better to have more town hall meetings that weren't by invitation only [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3249.9399999999996s)]
*  But allow people to come out and ask questions and so you can justify positions and justify where you stand [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3254.54s)]
*  None of that was done [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3260.82s)]
*  But but TV stations made a ton of money. I mean the the fact that a quarter billion dollars was spent in Montana is wild since [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3262.5400000000004s)]
*  That's like a third little more than a little less than a third of what was spent in all of Barack Obama's 2008 national campaign [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3269.9s)]
*  Which had all the money in the world that is we are in a different [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3275.3s)]
*  I mean, I couldn't even imagine how you would spend that much money in Montana given the cost of TV there [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3278.5s)]
*  It's just it's truly wild. Well, we did a TV who did it on digital. We did billboards. We did direct mail [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3283.1000000000004s)]
*  We had people knocking on doors [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3289.1s)]
*  I mean we had everything and so did they by the way they had all that and more and and that's that's what happened [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3290.58s)]
*  but in the end, I think Dan where the problem really is is that [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3296.38s)]
*  The old system forced candidates out into the people so the people could ask questions [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3300.86s)]
*  So you had to meet people eyeball to eyeball now now you're meeting people online or meeting them with commercials [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3305.7s)]
*  And by the way, the number of commercials that were on TV was almost voter abuse [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3310.74s)]
*  So so it'd be great it would be really good and I know it's gonna be very difficult to change but [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3315.42s)]
*  This is a united decision the McCutcheon decision [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3322.06s)]
*  All those decisions just allow for a lot of money to come in and it really does [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3325.18s)]
*  Not only affect elections, but it also helps paralyze government, which is also very very negative [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3330.46s)]
*  Probably probably more important than anything else is the paralysis that's gone on here in Washington DC [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3335.42s)]
*  Because of these Supreme Court decisions you you brought up the National Democratic Party brand since you first started running you've obviously been running in a [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3340.54s)]
*  Traditionally Republican state you've always been an independent voice. You haven't spent a lot of time campaigning with National Democrats [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3347.34s)]
*  You've carved out your own [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3352.7799999999997s)]
*  Very unique place in our party. How is the party brand? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3354.7s)]
*  Changed or become maybe more burdensome to you over the time you've been in the Senate. It's you know, I've been at this since [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3359.2999999999997s)]
*  2006 and I can tell you it's never been [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3366.66s)]
*  It's never been that great actually for the last 18 years [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3370.62s)]
*  I [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3374.74s)]
*  do think that [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3376.46s)]
*  You know the the party needs to focus on some things that they used to really focus on [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3378.74s)]
*  I'll just I'll just give you give you please do please do. Yep [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3384.74s)]
*  You know Democrats always pride themselves in being the party of the working man and woman [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3388.34s)]
*  We might be trying to sell that but they ain't buying it and [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3396.46s)]
*  And so I think that you know things like [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3399.66s)]
*  Giving away money [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3405.3s)]
*  To people who really didn't do anything to earn it is not something that [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3408.62s)]
*  People buy and it's not something that I personally buy either by the way [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3414.02s)]
*  I think you appreciate the money you've earned you don't appreciate money that's given to you and [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3417.5s)]
*  And I think that hurts the party I do think that [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3423.02s)]
*  The issue on the border was a killer and [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3426.86s)]
*  And you know, I tried to make the point that Congress has to do their job and we had an opportunity to pass a bill [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3430.3s)]
*  but the damage had already been done with the previous three and a half years and so [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3435.42s)]
*  And I'm gonna tell you that I'm not telling I'm not saying that Republicans walked up to me and said, you know [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3441.2200000000003s)]
*  Do you believe in a secure border rock rib? [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3446.42s)]
*  Democrats [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3449.82s)]
*  generational FDR Democrats were coming up to me going [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3451.1400000000003s)]
*  Where are you out on the border? I'm seeing all these ads that you want to open board [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3455.0s)]
*  I said no, I believe in an absolute secure border. We need to know who's coming across there [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3458.2s)]
*  There's bad people want to do bad things in this country. We need to know who's coming across this border [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3461.56s)]
*  They need to follow the law. They need to get in line [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3466.04s)]
*  They need to learn language just like my ancestors did and they would go well, that's good to hear and these are these aren't Republicans [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3468.32s)]
*  They're asking this these are Democrats. Okay, and so [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3475.36s)]
*  The border was the border was was was certainly a big issue [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3479.06s)]
*  And then I don't know that we did enough to really and I'm talking we a Democratic Party as a party to to lower costs [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3482.14s)]
*  and [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3490.1s)]
*  look [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3491.1s)]
*  I want to go back into campaign campaign mode here, but I will for a second [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3493.66s)]
*  I mean look I've there are four companies that control 80% of the meat in this country. That is not competition [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3497.22s)]
*  That is collusion. We need to figure out ways to enforce the Packers and Stockyards Act [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3503.74s)]
*  I've been saying that since I was a farmer only wasn't even involved in state or federal politics [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3507.66s)]
*  But the truth is that message didn't get through and I think that would help both people in production agriculture and the consumer [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3513.74s)]
*  But the message didn't get through we've done some things on housing and housing in Montana [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3519.1s)]
*  It will ebb and flow but the truth is is that if we can do some things particularly for first-time homebuyers [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3523.74s)]
*  I hope this happens after I'm gone by the way do some things for home first-time home buyers [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3528.98s)]
*  It's a it's a positive thing for for all of us [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3533.14s)]
*  And by the way instead of giving loan forgiveness for college education [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3536.58s)]
*  Let's figure out how to reduce costs for college education for everybody [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3541.98s)]
*  You know lower the rates so you get the bank rate on all our all our college loans and make it [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3545.98s)]
*  Retroactive for everybody that's got a college loan [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3552.62s)]
*  So you're not just picking out a select few at this moment in time and saying you know what? [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3555.1s)]
*  You guys are gonna get your loans forgiven and everybody else that pay for their loans or people who are gonna come up later and have [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3559.54s)]
*  Loans aren't gonna get advantage of that [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3564.94s)]
*  I think people see that as patently unfair and I think it hurts Democrats [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3566.8s)]
*  There's been this debate in the party because it's you know everywhere right Ohio across across the nation [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3570.42s)]
*  So all the reasons Kamala Harris lost is [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3576.34s)]
*  Donald Trump made huge gains with what had been the core of the Democratic base as you've got working-class voters, right? [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3578.42s)]
*  Of all races all backgrounds everything [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3583.54s)]
*  But there's this debate in the party about do we have a policy problem or a message problem? [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3587.06s)]
*  It sounds like you're saying we might we have both perhaps yes, that's exactly what I would say we have both we we don't message [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3592.74s)]
*  What we are doing very very well, and I can give you some concrete example [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3598.54s)]
*  Please do and and and we need we need to modify what we're doing okay? [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3601.7599999999998s)]
*  I can give you several so we passed the largest infrastructure bill since the year. I was born. I'm 68 years old [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3607.62s)]
*  1956 is the last time we had an infrastructure bill this [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3614.58s)]
*  this big this this [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3618.2999999999997s)]
*  generational and [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3621.7400000000002s)]
*  The minute we passed that bill which was classified as some as a small infrastructure bill by people [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3623.86s)]
*  Democrats were saying this is just a small infrastructure bill. There's a bigger one coming later [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3630.04s)]
*  well, that's kind of shooting yourself in the foot right off the bat and [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3634.34s)]
*  And then we didn't spend any time telling people what it did and then by the time by the time [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3638.1s)]
*  It started going it's too late. I mean you know that you know this you you're a guy that understands communication [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3644.14s)]
*  You've got a moment time to get that information out, and if you don't utilize that moment of time you lose it [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3650.7s)]
*  And that's just one example of many [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3655.7s)]
*  Things that came down the pipe every bill every you want to talk about working people every bill that this [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3659.82s)]
*  administration and [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3667.1s)]
*  Congress did had a component in it for union members [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3668.42s)]
*  Every one of them, and I thought at the time I thought wow this is pretty amazing [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3672.66s)]
*  I believe if you want the job done right best way to do is go get a union member to do it [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3676.8599999999997s)]
*  I believe that in my heart [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3681.14s)]
*  I think if you want to expand the middle class the best way to do that is span the union movement in this country [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3682.2599999999998s)]
*  But the truth is union members didn't know that happened their leadership did but the rank-and-file didn't and I think we lost a lot [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3687.7799999999997s)]
*  Of them because of that they didn't understand who really was fighting for them back in Washington, DC [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3695.2999999999997s)]
*  So I do think it's both. It's both a content issue and a messaging issue [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3700.38s)]
*  You know my roots are in South Dakota politics. I work for Tim Johnson at Tom Daschle and their elections [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3705.1s)]
*  Personally mine by the way. Yeah, Tim Johnson rest in peace great great American senator [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3710.82s)]
*  the [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3716.1800000000003s)]
*  one of the ways in which those [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3717.7000000000003s)]
*  Democrats and Democrats like yourself were able to win in these Republican states was there was a very vibrant in these states local media [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3720.38s)]
*  So your constituents could actually get to know you they would get to know the things you did [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3726.42s)]
*  That's obviously changed dramatically particularly over the last four years [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3729.9s)]
*  I imagine that was probably a real challenge for you in the selection [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3732.5s)]
*  Yeah, I think if you want to talk about one thing that's changed dramatically in the last 18 years is [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3734.98s)]
*  Local press has gone away. I mean it really has we've got a few TV stations in Montana [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3739.98s)]
*  Most those are they're young reporters. They're still learning the ropes. They're they're looking to move up [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3744.66s)]
*  The old days of the newspapers that had the reporters that asked you tough questions and held you accountable [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3750.58s)]
*  Those days are all but gone [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3757.82s)]
*  There's still a few of those folks around but they're all but gone and I think that [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3759.42s)]
*  that has been a huge huge had a huge huge impact on [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3763.9s)]
*  Who people are voting for because they really don't their candidate the public officials aren't and I'm talking not only at the USN [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3769.26s)]
*  I'm I'm talking County Commissioners and City Council. None of those folks are being held accountable to the level [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3776.46s)]
*  They once were they don't think everybody's watching them and if people think they can do stuff and get away with it [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3781.62s)]
*  I don't think it adds to a better government. It adds to a much worse one. It's a huge problem and I don't know [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3787.46s)]
*  How to solve this one Dan. I really don't because the internet has kind of taken those birds over and [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3793.7400000000002s)]
*  And there just isn't any money in papers anymore and I get it and and it shows I mean we've got [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3801.2200000000003s)]
*  We just got a few papers in the state that are just a shadow of once they what they once were [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3807.9s)]
*  And it's it's unfortunate but that's that's that's probably the biggest change in the last 18 years quite frankly [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3813.48s)]
*  Yeah, it just makes it so hard for constituents to actually get to know their [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3819.16s)]
*  Settlers their election officials as people as opposed to the caricature, right? It becomes very challenging [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3822.36s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. And I've got to tell you the first I remember when I got in the state legislature [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3826.68s)]
*  I did an interview with a guy by name of Mike Dennison and Mike Dennison was a good guy and I read his papers for years [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3830.8s)]
*  And you're sitting on the farm and I thought his articles were great [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3836.32s)]
*  I'm gonna tell you what he ripped me one end to the other [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3838.92s)]
*  I wasn't I wasn't prepared when I went into the interview and it taught me a really important lesson [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3842.52s)]
*  You know, I don't care how well you like that reporter if you're not prepared when you go in for that interview [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3847.56s)]
*  they're gonna they're gonna take you apart and [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3853.12s)]
*  So consequently folks don't have to prepare anymore. They don't have to justify their position [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3856.44s)]
*  Why did you vote this way or why did you vote that way? [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3861.48s)]
*  Because there's nobody there asking the tough questions anymore as you mentioned your your farmer [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3863.64s)]
*  The farmers were for a very long time the I community was a core of the Democratic base [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3869.04s)]
*  It's one of the reasons why? [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3873.3199999999997s)]
*  Even though they were Republican states [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3875.24s)]
*  We had Democratic senators oftentimes two Democratic senators in places like Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3876.7999999999997s)]
*  Iowa not too many years ago [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3883.56s)]
*  How have Democrats lost farmers and what can we do to get them back? [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3886.7599999999998s)]
*  Once again, I don't think it's any different than the working folks [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3890.8799999999997s)]
*  I think Democrats do a lot of things for folks in production egg and we don't talk about it with folks in production egg [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3894.2s)]
*  You know, they're the stuff that the stuff that's been done in crop insurance the stuff that's been done [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3901.32s)]
*  In the different farm programs that are out there for [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3907.52s)]
*  Or are pretty important. I will tell you this though to farmers have changed [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3911.2s)]
*  When I was growing up my folks told me never depend upon the federal government you ever depend on the federal government [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3918.08s)]
*  You're gonna lose the farm [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3922.96s)]
*  now I [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3924.32s)]
*  Think if you took away the farm bill from these farmers, they'd go broke in wholesale fashion [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3926.0s)]
*  I think their whole farming [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3931.7200000000003s)]
*  Plan is based around federal subsidies. I'm gonna tell you and I still believe this my folks were right [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3936.36s)]
*  You want to talk about socialism that socialism and we've got to start making it so the farmers and ranchers can get their [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3942.84s)]
*  Paycheck from the marketplace and the only way you do that is to insert more competition into that marketplace [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3950.3599999999997s)]
*  So you get a fair price and the taxpayer then doesn't have to subsidize those multinational agribusinesses [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3957.22s)]
*  that are out there putting the boots to farmers and ranchers every single day because they can and so [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3963.68s)]
*  Farmers have changed they have it didn't used to be this way [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3971.04s)]
*  But now [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3975.54s)]
*  I'm not so sure that there aren't a lot of farmers who say hell [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3976.7799999999997s)]
*  You know if Trump puts on a bunch of tariffs and the prices go to hell who cares? [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3979.58s)]
*  I'm still gonna be okay because I'm gonna get a subsidy from the federal government [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3982.8999999999996s)]
*  That is absolutely the wrong way to think about it. Same thing on things like climate change [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3986.4199999999996s)]
*  So if the climate gets worse and I don't get as much rain what the hell, you know [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3990.74s)]
*  I've got crop insurance to back me up [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3993.98s)]
*  That's the wrong way to think about it because those programs could end tomorrow and they might by the way the project [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=3995.7799999999997s)]
*  2025 said [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=4002.3799999999997s)]
*  we're gonna do away with the Department of Agriculture and so [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=4003.98s)]
*  folks need to really [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=4007.7400000000002s)]
*  Understand that who they have in public office makes a difference because things don't things aren't on autopilot here [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=4009.3s)]
*  Although they might seem like it they're not [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=4015.54s)]
*  Before I let you go son [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=4018.46s)]
*  I want to get just your reaction as a long-time member of the Senate to [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=4019.46s)]
*  Donald Trump's cabinet nominations that he has made or his purported soon-to-be nominations [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=4022.7s)]
*  And the idea that he might actually recess appoint them. Could you see that possibly happening in the Senate? [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gnGi3mw0A&t=4027.42s)]
