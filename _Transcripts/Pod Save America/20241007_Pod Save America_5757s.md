Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Elon Musk Jumped Into Trump's Pennsylvania Rally and Gave an Unhinged Speech
**Pod Save America:** [October 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI)
*  The late great Hannibal Lecter is a wonderful man. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=0.0s)]
*  They say it's racist to do anything. I had a dive out in the mountain today and I'm sure they're going to call that racist too. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=8.0s)]
*  It's good. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=15.0s)]
*  In Springfield, they're eating the dogs, the people that came in, they're eating the cats, they're eating the pets of the people that live there. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=17.0s)]
*  And just to clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=29.0s)]
*  Well, Margaret, but... [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=39.0s)]
*  Nora? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=40.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=41.0s)]
*  Senator, we have so much to get to. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=42.0s)]
*  Margaret, I think it's important because... [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=43.0s)]
*  We're going to turn out of the economy. Thank you. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=44.0s)]
*  Margaret, the rules were that you guys were going to fact check. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=45.0s)]
*  The economy... [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=48.0s)]
*  So, Pennsylvania, today I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=49.0s)]
*  Yes! [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=56.0s)]
*  Do we believe in freedom? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=59.0s)]
*  Yes! [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=61.0s)]
*  Do we believe in opportunity? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=63.0s)]
*  Yes! [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=65.0s)]
*  Do we believe in the promise of America? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=67.0s)]
*  Yes! [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=70.0s)]
*  And are we ready to fight for it? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=72.0s)]
*  Yes! [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=75.0s)]
*  And when we fight... [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=78.0s)]
*  We win! [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=80.0s)]
*  What's up, Philly? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=86.0s)]
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Jon Favre. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=114.0s)]
*  I'm Simone Sanders Townsend. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=118.0s)]
*  I'm Jon Lovett. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=121.0s)]
*  I'm Tommy Vitor. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=123.0s)]
*  I'm Dan Pfeiffer. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=125.0s)]
*  We've got a great show for you tonight. Your senator, Bob Casey, is here. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=129.0s)]
*  And we are so lucky to have our friend Simone, co-host of MSNBC's The Weeknd. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=135.0s)]
*  And in a past life, senior advisor to Vice President Kamala Harris. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=142.0s)]
*  All right, so with less than 30 days left of the 2024 campaign, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=149.0s)]
*  Donald Trump was here in Pennsylvania over the weekend for... [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=155.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, what are you going to do? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=161.0s)]
*  Are we booing Pennsylvania? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=163.0s)]
*  Just checking. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=166.0s)]
*  He was here for your typical October campaign event. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=167.0s)]
*  He was a Italian butler at the site where he was shot that included church bells, parachute divers, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=171.0s)]
*  an opera singer doing a rendition of Ave Maria, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=178.0s)]
*  and the world's richest man jumping up and down in an Occupy Mars t-shirt and a MAGA hat. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=182.0s)]
*  Looks like he's having fun, huh? Which is what's important. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=192.0s)]
*  Let's hear what new Trump surrogate Elon Musk had to say. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=197.0s)]
*  As you can see, I'm not just MAGA, I'm Dark MAGA. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=200.0s)]
*  You know, the true test of someone's character is how they behave under fire. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=203.0s)]
*  And we had one president who couldn't climb a flight of stairs, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=212.0s)]
*  and another who was fist-pumping after getting shot. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=217.0s)]
*  Fight, fight, fight! Blood coming down the face! [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=223.0s)]
*  President Trump must win to preserve the Constitution. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=227.0s)]
*  He must win to preserve democracy in America. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=231.0s)]
*  Text people now. Now. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=235.0s)]
*  And then make sure they actually do vote. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=240.0s)]
*  If they don't, this will be the last election. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=246.0s)]
*  That's my prediction. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=250.0s)]
*  Riveting. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=252.0s)]
*  So, Tommy, Elon's already been helping Trump's campaign by turning Twitter into a MAGA-friendly social media platform [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=255.0s)]
*  and amplifying right-wing conspiracies to his 200 million followers. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=262.0s)]
*  He's also funding a super PAC that's now apparently in charge of Trump's ground game. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=266.0s)]
*  But how much value do you think he adds as an actual surrogate? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=271.0s)]
*  So, as we saw, Elon's not a great speaker. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=276.0s)]
*  It wasn't a great speech, it wasn't polished. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=281.0s)]
*  He's so online. He tried to make this dark MAGA joke, which I assume was like a dark Brandon takeoff. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=283.0s)]
*  I still don't understand what he meant. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=289.0s)]
*  No one got it in the crowd. You're not alone. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=291.0s)]
*  He also kind of hopped up and down. It looked like he was kind of getting taken up with the rapture. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=293.0s)]
*  He was also telling the story about the blood. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=298.0s)]
*  He sort of sounded like a 13-year-old telling you about a movie they just watched. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=302.0s)]
*  But the message overall, I thought, was okay. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=305.0s)]
*  I mean, he's obviously incredibly enamored of the story of Trump's experience at Butler in the shooting. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=310.0s)]
*  He talked about freedom of speech. He talked about the Second Amendment. He talked about voter ID laws. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=316.0s)]
*  So things, I think, that connected with the audience. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=321.0s)]
*  He also, though, was really focused on voter registration and telling people to get registered and to bug their friends [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=324.0s)]
*  and was talking about registration deadlines in Arizona and Georgia. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=333.0s)]
*  So I think, would I send Elon on a solo speaking tour? No. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=337.0s)]
*  He's a weirdo. He's not good in front of a crowd. It didn't go well. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=342.0s)]
*  But I think he kind of served the role that you might imagine a field organizer serving at a Harris event, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=345.0s)]
*  being like, register to vote, tell five friends, bug them, be really annoying about it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=354.0s)]
*  So he was like, he was okay. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=358.0s)]
*  Simone, what did you think? What's your reaction to Musk saying, this will be the last election unless Trump wins? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=361.0s)]
*  I thought that was our line. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=369.0s)]
*  Well, you know, they're telling us out loud what they're going to do. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=371.0s)]
*  He's like, this will be the last election. We will be sure that me and Starlink are going to make sure it all goes down. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=375.0s)]
*  I just, I think Elon Musk is strange. I really do. I think he's strange. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=381.0s)]
*  And I think he is. And I think he is actually the physical embodiment of when you just have so much money, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=386.0s)]
*  people will literally let you do anything. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=392.0s)]
*  Like the federal government is still putting lots of chips in Elon Musk's basket. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=394.0s)]
*  Yet here he is helping dismantle democracy as we speak. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=398.0s)]
*  And sowing so much misinformation about what's happening in North Carolina and Tennessee and Georgia after the Hurricane Helene. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=402.0s)]
*  So I was just kind of like, why Elon? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=409.0s)]
*  But maybe Elon Musk was like, I'll give you an extra bill if you let me get on stage. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=412.0s)]
*  Let me out there. So I don't know. I just really feel like Donald Trump is not doing. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=417.0s)]
*  This is not a this is not a campaign that's running an operation like they are trying to win. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=423.0s)]
*  Where is your infrastructure? Where are your door knocks? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=427.0s)]
*  And what the hell does Elon Musk know about running field operations? Who has he ever elected? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=430.0s)]
*  I was I'm very confused by the entire situation. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=436.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's and I think because I think it doesn't make any sense. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=439.0s)]
*  I think it's confusing. You know, you wouldn't you just like, oh, he's a who's speaking at your rally. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=443.0s)]
*  A kind of a deeply discomforting billionaire corrupt with interest before the federal government, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=453.0s)]
*  spreading misinformation wherever he goes, a man with a personality so bad it causes people to sell their cars. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=463.0s)]
*  I'm not gonna lie. I went to the Tesla place the other day and I was like, I just can't do it. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=477.0s)]
*  No, just a washing ketamine. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=481.0s)]
*  Well, it is it. Well, I mean, allegedly, the it is just sort of like a microcosm. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=484.0s)]
*  Like you want one of the many reasons race is close is because other billionaires are dumping money in this state. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=492.0s)]
*  Billionaires who would surely be quite happy to have Donald Trump protect their their interests. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=498.0s)]
*  If Donald Trump were to become President, Elon, there's a Donald Trump posted himself. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=505.0s)]
*  If Elon would come begging because I would do what it could because he needs the federal government to do what he wants it to do. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=509.0s)]
*  Like the corruption is on display with Elon. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=515.0s)]
*  When Elon wasn't kissing the ring, he was like, oh, this guy would come to me and beg for stuff. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=517.0s)]
*  And now he's jumping up, jumping up to Trump said, how high? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=521.0s)]
*  No, Elon said, how high? Fuck, shut up. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=524.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't want to be the skunk of the garden party here. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=528.0s)]
*  Like he was a terrible speaker and he's a weird individual, but he also has appeal to the exact voters we've talked about who are the overly online young men. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=531.0s)]
*  Right. There are Elon fanboys all over the Internet. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=542.0s)]
*  And that is the upside of this for Trump. Now, what we have to do. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=545.0s)]
*  I was I was wondering about this. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=547.0s)]
*  Like, do you think there are Elon fanboys who are not already Trump? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=550.0s)]
*  Yes, 100 percent. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=553.0s)]
*  It is. This is this is Rogan world. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=555.0s)]
*  Right. Is where Elon lives. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=559.0s)]
*  And so he is a gateway drug to that. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=561.0s)]
*  And now there's I mean, we have to sit by and take it like there's arguments to be made here. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=563.0s)]
*  Right. Like he is thoroughly corrupt. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=568.0s)]
*  We like a pretty you do a pretty easy calculation of the billions of dollars in tax cuts that Elon Musk would get from Donald Trump in a way to push back on it. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=570.0s)]
*  But they used him poorly here and he performed even more poorly than that. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=577.0s)]
*  But there is among like deep down in all the weird shit that Trump does, there is a strategic purpose to it. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=582.0s)]
*  And this one does have one. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=588.0s)]
*  I just feel like I just think about Ron DeSantis and how he put his eggs in the super online Elon basket. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=590.0s)]
*  Yes. And that did not work out well for him. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=595.0s)]
*  And so I don't know. I just kind of feel like Elon Musk. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=597.0s)]
*  The clips coming out of it aren't good. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=600.0s)]
*  The reason you do this is because you want the clips because the clips will go viral online. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=602.0s)]
*  But he looked he looks underwhelming in the clips. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=606.0s)]
*  Underwhelming, kind of off, kind of weird, a little like, oh, socially awkward, not strong. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=609.0s)]
*  He's under Wrogan, who is also like very problematic. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=614.0s)]
*  You're right. He's underwhelming and a weirdo. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=618.0s)]
*  But he's also like his ego is very fragile and easily stroked. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=620.0s)]
*  And there's all this reporting that he was deeply hurt by the fact that the Biden administration never gave Tesla any love, never invited him to things, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=623.0s)]
*  And Trump like smells that he senses it. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=632.0s)]
*  He thinks like, all right, I'm going to put this nerd on stage for three minutes and he'll cut me another hundred million dollar check. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=635.0s)]
*  Billionaire personality disorders have done a lot of damage. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=641.0s)]
*  Continue to do a lot of damage to all of us. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=644.0s)]
*  We'll have to deal with it. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=646.0s)]
*  Tell your friends and family about BPD. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=647.0s)]
*  Keep an eye watch for the symptoms. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=653.0s)]
*  There it's if you've got early billionaire personality disorder is treatable. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=655.0s)]
*  So after a few hours of warm up speakers, a few hours, including JD Vance, Larry Trump, some QAnon weirdos, Trump took the stage and he opened with an admittedly good line about starting the rally right where he left off last time he was in Butler. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=662.0s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=679.0s)]
*  And as I was saying. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=680.0s)]
*  Oh, I love that. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=690.0s)]
*  I love that chart. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=691.0s)]
*  I love that graph over the past eight years. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=693.0s)]
*  Those who want to stop us from achieving this future have slandered me, impeached me, indicted me, tried to throw me off the ballot. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=696.0s)]
*  And who knows, maybe even tried to kill me. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=705.0s)]
*  We can't take another four years like this. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=708.0s)]
*  We won't have a country left. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=710.0s)]
*  We're not going to have a country left. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=711.0s)]
*  You leave from the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=713.0s)]
*  You go drive down to Washington, D.C. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=716.0s)]
*  And you drive down and you end up getting murdered. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=719.0s)]
*  You end up getting hurt. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=722.0s)]
*  You get mugged. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=724.0s)]
*  These people are crazy. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=725.0s)]
*  These people are crazy. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=728.0s)]
*  You end up getting murdered. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=730.0s)]
*  You just drive down to D.C. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=731.0s)]
*  You get murdered. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=732.0s)]
*  He Trump. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=733.0s)]
*  Trump loves an evocative second person fake anecdote. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=734.0s)]
*  Completely made up. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=739.0s)]
*  Well, I'm a toy dad. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=741.0s)]
*  I know he did. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=743.0s)]
*  He did. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=744.0s)]
*  They did some. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=745.0s)]
*  They did a lot of memorializing of what about what did Donald Trump do? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=746.0s)]
*  Well, no, there was. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=750.0s)]
*  You do nothing. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=752.0s)]
*  You do nothing. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=753.0s)]
*  You did nothing. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=754.0s)]
*  That's the damn point. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=755.0s)]
*  I was going to say, you are leaving out the awkward hug of his fireman's uniform at the convention. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=756.0s)]
*  I was touched. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=763.0s)]
*  There was a wait. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=765.0s)]
*  There was a apparently there was a live painting of Corey compoteur. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=766.0s)]
*  And then the person was painting him on the stage. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=771.0s)]
*  Donald Trump could give a beautiful eulogy to this person who died at the hands of somebody inflicting political violence. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=774.0s)]
*  If you get up there and lie about your political opponents to attribute a murder to them, you are dishonoring that person's memory. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=783.0s)]
*  I don't care how many of Ave Maria's there are. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=792.0s)]
*  It's despicable. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=794.0s)]
*  You're dishonoring the Secret Service agents who put their lives on the line for you. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=796.0s)]
*  Like that. Yes, it was a debacle, but they did save your life. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=799.0s)]
*  And you're dishonoring those people and their service. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=803.0s)]
*  So it's fucking doesn't matter. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=805.0s)]
*  I don't care what they do to pretend they give a shit about this guy who lost their lives. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=806.0s)]
*  They're dishonoring him every day. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=810.0s)]
*  They get out there and hint or imply that Democrats are responsible. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=811.0s)]
*  And Eric. Well, Eric Trump didn't just hint or imply. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=815.0s)]
*  He was like, they try to kill my dad. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=817.0s)]
*  And who is they? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=820.0s)]
*  I mean, if we want to be factually correct, the first person that attempted to assassinate the former president was a registered Republican. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=821.0s)]
*  Yeah. And the second person was a supporter that then turned his support because of Ukraine. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=829.0s)]
*  So they also might need to be specific. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=833.0s)]
*  But also, this is like. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=837.0s)]
*  J.D. Vance was one of the most concerning comments for me from that rally because he said Trump took a bullet for democracy. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=840.0s)]
*  And I just had to pause because like maybe we have different definitions of democracy, but democracy doesn't require Donald Trump to get shot. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=847.0s)]
*  No, that's not like that. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=854.0s)]
*  He didn't take a bullet for democracy. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=856.0s)]
*  And it's just it's just making a mockery of all of us every single time. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=858.0s)]
*  But they say it so much has become so regular. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=864.0s)]
*  Some people just like gloss over it as though it's just part of the ship. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=866.0s)]
*  The the Trump campaign told The New York Times they envisioned this event as a show of strength and as a way to recapture the good political vibes that they felt a few days after he was shot at the RNC in Milwaukee. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=871.0s)]
*  You guys think this is recapturing those vibes? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=886.0s)]
*  Because then his whole plan was ruined when Joe Biden stepped aside and Kamala Harris is the new nominee. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=889.0s)]
*  And then she gained in the polls. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=896.0s)]
*  And so now he wants to go back. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=897.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think like to Dan's point, I don't think we should. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=900.0s)]
*  I think there's in a state that's going to be to close election. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=905.0s)]
*  He's got a lot of voters in Butler. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=910.0s)]
*  I think trying to create a pride of place in Butler, like you were there. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=911.0s)]
*  You came here. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=915.0s)]
*  This is where it happened. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=916.0s)]
*  You saw it. You're a part of it. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=917.0s)]
*  You're a part of this incredible, important story. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=918.0s)]
*  Like, I don't think we should undercount that. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=920.0s)]
*  Like, that could be important to people that were there. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=922.0s)]
*  Do I think it's persuasive to people outside of it? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=924.0s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=926.0s)]
*  But to people that are there, do I think it could really make sure they turn out, they turn their friends out? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=927.0s)]
*  Like, absolutely. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=930.0s)]
*  But we're also, I think, in some ways fortunate that like this moment, the idea that it could be about strength or kind of recapture that feeling, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=931.0s)]
*  It would be far more potent if Donald Trump had the capacity to transmute the experience of political violence into empathy and a distaste for political violence when it's directed at people that are not him. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=943.0s)]
*  But like, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=957.0s)]
*  A lot of me's in that clip that we heard. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=959.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=961.0s)]
*  I think it's sort of like Don Jr.'s therapist says to him all the time, you can't go to the hardware store for milk. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=962.0s)]
*  And that does. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=969.0s)]
*  And Donald Trump is not capable of providing that kind of empathy. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=970.0s)]
*  Dan. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=978.0s)]
*  You got to applause for Dan. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=985.0s)]
*  I think they just cheered a change in subject. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=987.0s)]
*  So, you know, Trump did get tens of thousands of people out to Butler in arguably the most important swing state where the race is basically tied. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=990.0s)]
*  Started clapping, basically tied. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1003.0s)]
*  What can you tell us about how the Trump campaign sees Pennsylvania and their path to victory here? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1006.0s)]
*  They are spending more money here than any other state because they believe, with good reason, is there someone who has a local television station here? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1014.0s)]
*  What was that? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1022.0s)]
*  There's some, there's some ad makers in the audience. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1025.0s)]
*  Because if they can win Pennsylvania, it makes Kamala Harris's path to 270 so much harder. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1030.0s)]
*  She now has to win two other states, right, in Georgia or North Carolina and one other one to get to 270. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1035.0s)]
*  So that's why they spend the most money here, they spend the most time here. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1042.0s)]
*  And their strategy is pretty simple. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1044.0s)]
*  So it includes driving up turnout and margins in the rural parts of Pennsylvania between Allegheny County and Philadelphia. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1046.0s)]
*  It is holding down Kamala Harris's margins, particularly in the suburbs in Bucks, Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery County right here outside of Philadelphia. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1053.0s)]
*  And the last part is to cut into Kamala Harris's vote totals and vote share among black voters, particularly here in Philadelphia. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1062.0s)]
*  Right, Biden, in the exit polls, Biden won black voters 92 to 7. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1069.0s)]
*  And she can just cut a few points from that in a state that Biden won by less than two points last time, you can get there. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1072.0s)]
*  So this is right on the margins. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1079.0s)]
*  And we know that's her strategy because the Harris strategy for winning is the exact inverse of that. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1082.0s)]
*  Hold down its margins in rural areas, jack up turnout here, and try to hit those Biden numbers in Philly with black voters. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1087.0s)]
*  So she's got to figure out how to hold his margins down here. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1093.0s)]
*  The Times had another great story Sunday morning that a lot of Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans have been eagerly awaiting for a long time now. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1098.0s)]
*  The headline Trump's speeches increasingly angry and rambling reignite the question of age. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1108.0s)]
*  A lot of a lot of resistance Democrats opening that in an incognito window. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1113.0s)]
*  So the piece goes on to analyze Trump's 2024 speeches compared to his earlier campaigns. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1122.0s)]
*  And they got experts and former staffers to say that he has lost a step, that he's more forgetful, more rambling, longer, longer tangents, all signs of cognitive decline. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1128.0s)]
*  What do you guys think of the piece? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1138.0s)]
*  And should this be in some way part of the closing argument for Kamala Harris and the Democrats? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1140.0s)]
*  I just love the way they tried to apply data science to the story. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1149.0s)]
*  Well, this is the hard thing about being a reporter. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1153.0s)]
*  It's like you can watch this man declining before your very eyes. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1155.0s)]
*  You can watch him losing it at events. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1158.0s)]
*  And then they're like, carry the one. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1160.0s)]
*  And you have to go to some AI analysis. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1163.0s)]
*  When you do the regression analysis, he sounds like a fucking moron. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1165.0s)]
*  They literally reported that he's using 69 percent nice more profanity in speeches, which is some sort of element of decline, which in that case, like, God help us. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1172.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1181.0s)]
*  He speaks at a fourth grade level. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1182.0s)]
*  That's what the story said. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1184.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1186.0s)]
*  As opposed to Ron DeSantis, who spoke at an eighth grade level and other candidates, as the New York Times analysis showed. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1187.0s)]
*  Honestly, it's 2024 eighth grade. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1194.0s)]
*  Great. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1196.0s)]
*  Great. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1198.0s)]
*  Great. Yeah, honestly. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1199.0s)]
*  Second grade. Fine. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1200.0s)]
*  Whatever it takes. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1201.0s)]
*  Look, I think the reality, though, is that unfortunately, this is especially for the again, Trump supporters is baked in. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1202.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1211.0s)]
*  Donald Trump could literally get on stage and go googly googly moogly mash. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1212.0s)]
*  Fight, fight, fight. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1216.0s)]
*  And they'd be like, he is brilliant. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1217.0s)]
*  Honestly, like, that is my president. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1219.0s)]
*  And so it's baked in for that. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1221.0s)]
*  But that those people have a ceiling. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1223.0s)]
*  I think for some folks who are like, I don't really know about Donald Trump. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1225.0s)]
*  I don't like some of the things he's doing, but I think the economy was really good. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1230.0s)]
*  You know, the Jamie Dimons of the world who say he hasn't made a decision yet. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1234.0s)]
*  Sorry, Jamie. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1237.0s)]
*  Don't folks like that. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1238.0s)]
*  They'll they'll read this coupled with his googly gop answer on child care and say, well, maybe maybe he's not all the way there. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1241.0s)]
*  Maybe he doesn't have it. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1250.0s)]
*  Maybe this isn't right. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1251.0s)]
*  Maybe he doesn't understand. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1252.0s)]
*  And now he's surrounding himself with some of the fanatics and maybe people will say, OK, maybe I don't want to vote for him. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1253.0s)]
*  I don't know if I want to vote for her yet. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1259.0s)]
*  Maybe I will vote for her. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1261.0s)]
*  Maybe I will just leave the top of the ticket blank. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1262.0s)]
*  So I think that this matters for that. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1264.0s)]
*  But I do not think that the I think sometimes the the the resistance Dems put a little too much stock in the this is what she should be doing. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1266.0s)]
*  She should be leaning in on this. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1275.0s)]
*  People people care about her, what she is going to do. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1278.0s)]
*  They know Donald Trump is like. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1282.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1285.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1286.0s)]
*  What she said. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1287.0s)]
*  And they I just don't think juxtaposing the like, oh, he's old and he can't talk like just play the clip. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1288.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1295.0s)]
*  And let the people deduce for themselves. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1296.0s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1297.0s)]
*  I think the smartest thing Kamala Harris did in that debate was invite people to watch the rallies. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1298.0s)]
*  She said go. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1304.0s)]
*  She's a go. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1305.0s)]
*  Yeah. Go to the rallies. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1306.0s)]
*  But I think it's useful and just in one way, which is there is a voter who thinks I don't love Donald Trump that much. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1307.0s)]
*  But we survived four years of Donald Trump as president. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1315.0s)]
*  And I think I liked the economy better than. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1318.0s)]
*  So aren't we going to be able to just survive another four years? [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1321.0s)]
*  And I think the answer to that is if you thought that Donald Trump was bad, but OK, this Donald Trump is much worse. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1324.0s)]
*  He has declined significantly since then. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1330.0s)]
*  And he's a little bit crazier. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1332.0s)]
*  And he's deteriorated and he's surrounded with crazier people. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1334.0s)]
*  And so this is not the Donald Trump that you had back in 2016. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1337.0s)]
*  I think that is like that is one way it could be useful. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1340.0s)]
*  So is Dan about to throw cold water on this analysis? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1343.0s)]
*  There are two different arguments here. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1347.0s)]
*  They're sort of interrelated. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1349.0s)]
*  One is and this is the one the Biden campaign was trying to do before the debate, which is Donald Trump changed after he lost election. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1350.0s)]
*  He got radicalized January 6. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1356.0s)]
*  And this is he's now worse than he was before. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1357.0s)]
*  And the other argument is he's really old. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1359.0s)]
*  His brain is pickled and he's melting before your eyes. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1362.0s)]
*  And I don't think I agree with someone that should not be the main thrust of the message by Trump gives off vigorous energy. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1365.0s)]
*  He gives off crazy energy. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1373.0s)]
*  Right. He seems like an insane person. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1375.0s)]
*  And so he doesn't seem he doesn't he doesn't seem feeble feeble. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1377.0s)]
*  He seems not especially after but and especially in clips, by the way, because it's the you have to watch a good length of it to really get the sense that this man's losing it. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1381.0s)]
*  Because if you just watch the clips on your local news, they are often sanitized. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1389.0s)]
*  They're trying to stitch together. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1393.0s)]
*  Ninety one minutes, I think, was the estimate of how long his rallies are now of insanity into 60, 30, 60 seconds of something coherent you could put in the news. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1395.0s)]
*  And so you people aren't seeing it. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1405.0s)]
*  It is just worth noting. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1407.0s)]
*  And I know this isn't constructive, but it is fucking wild that we had a three year conversation about Joe Biden's age and mental capacity. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1408.0s)]
*  And we're just like Donald Trump, who at the end of his second term will be older than Joe Biden is. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1416.0s)]
*  We're just like, that's fine. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1421.0s)]
*  We're not going to worry about it. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1422.0s)]
*  And Joe Biden was starting at a much higher baseline than Donald Trump here. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1423.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1427.0s)]
*  So he wasn't fucking Cicero in 2016, but now he is incoherent. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1428.0s)]
*  Not Cicero, not Cicero. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1433.0s)]
*  Something is something to tell undecided voters. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1435.0s)]
*  That is not a good campaign message. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1437.0s)]
*  We do not need to introduce Cicero. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1439.0s)]
*  If you have someone, a philosophy major perhaps that you're trying to persuade, maybe that's right. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1442.0s)]
*  Perhaps an Elon fanboy philosophy major. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1447.0s)]
*  That's how you get them. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1449.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1450.0s)]
*  Talk about me. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1451.0s)]
*  We will be back with more news. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1452.0s)]

*  And we're back. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1521.0s)]
*  This week, Donald Trump started several new conspiracies and wouldn't you know it, Laura Ingraham was standing by to help spread the bad word. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1529.0s)]
*  So now it's time for a segment we call OK, stop. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1535.0s)]
*  Let's see how Fox News handled its duty to viewers during a natural disaster. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1542.0s)]
*  Former director of speech writing for President Obama and co-host of Pod Save America, John Fravra. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1546.0s)]
*  As a speech writer, how impressed are you with my co-pilot analogy? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1553.0s)]
*  It was a little hard to follow. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1558.0s)]
*  How did I get here? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1561.0s)]
*  I don't say it's a little hard to follow was you. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1562.0s)]
*  It was you. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1566.0s)]
*  You got him. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1567.0s)]
*  You went right to what? [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1568.0s)]
*  How did I get here? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1569.0s)]
*  Well, he was very proud of his intro. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1570.0s)]
*  He was talking about like Joe Biden was flying the plane and then and then he passed out and Kamala Harris took it. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1572.0s)]
*  Now she's crashing it. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1578.0s)]
*  He was like, wasn't that a good analogy? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1579.0s)]

*  But Jesse Waters is producers trying to get exactly how you think they look. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1668.0s)]
*  And they invited John to do it. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1675.0s)]
*  And despite the advice of many people on the stage, myself primarily, he did it. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1677.0s)]
*  Dan was so opposed to it when they knocked on the door and started talking to us. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1681.0s)]

*  Walz was on Fox News Sunday, my favorite channel, with Shannon Bream this morning. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1880.6s)]
*  He'll be on the broadcast a little later this week. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1885.36s)]
*  Shannon Bream this morning. He'll be on 60 Minutes. Jimmy Kimmel, and he's going to do a bunch [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1888.8s)]
*  of local press, Hispanic press, and a big podcast or two. Harris will also be on 60 Minutes with [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1894.6s)]
*  Walls, but they're also both by themselves in the interview. She's going to be on The View, on [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1906.76s)]
*  Colbert, Howard Stern. This is all this week, by the way. She's going to do a Univision Town Hall [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1912.52s)]
*  on Thursday. As we mentioned last show, she also recorded an episode of the massively popular Call [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1917.72s)]
*  Her Daddy podcast with Alex Cooper, where they discussed reproductive rights and other women's [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1923.6000000000001s)]
*  issues. Here is a clip. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1930.04s)]
*  I do want to clarify something. In the debate, former President Trump claimed that some states [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1932.04s)]
*  are executing babies after birth. Can you just clarify? That is not happening anywhere in the [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1940.44s)]
*  United States. It is not happening, and it's a lie. It's a bold-faced lie that he is suggesting. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1949.56s)]
*  He is suggesting that women in their ninth month of pregnancy are electing to have an abortion. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1959.0s)]
*  Are you kidding? That is so outrageously inaccurate, and it's so insulting to suggest that that would [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1971.56s)]
*  be happening and that women would be doing that. It's not happening anywhere. This guy is full of [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1984.44s)]
*  lies. I mean, I just have to be very candid with you. The idea that someone is not only so careless [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1991.72s)]
*  and irresponsible and reckless, but out and out lies to create fear and division in our country [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=1998.36s)]
*  and thinks he should be President of the United States standing behind the seal [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2009.48s)]
*  of the President of the United States using the microphone that comes with that [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2014.52s)]
*  and using that voice and those words in such an irresponsible, and that's mild, way. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2021.6399999999999s)]
*  This is why this election matters. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2032.76s)]
*  She was good. Good podcast. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2034.68s)]
*  Really good interview. Simone, you were a senior advisor to the VP in the White House. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2041.88s)]
*  She started off the first term with a few rough interviews. She got a lot better. She now seems [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2047.72s)]
*  pretty comfortable. Can you talk about how she sees interviews, how she prepares, and what you [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2051.7200000000003s)]
*  think the strategy is behind this latest media blitz? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2057.32s)]
*  I would argue that what we are seeing now is the product of decisions that the Vice President made [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2061.1600000000003s)]
*  mid through the end of her first year in the Vice Presidency. There was a time where she wasn't [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2069.2400000000002s)]
*  doing many interviews within the first year. I remember one day we were in our office and [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2075.0800000000004s)]
*  we're giving the news. I believe in giving all the news, even the bad news. I just hold that back [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2080.92s)]
*  to the end. We don't want you getting that one on the email. You don't make it in a sandwich? [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2085.32s)]
*  I say the good parts and I'm like, and if I may, ma'am. Then I grab my folder. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2090.2s)]
*  There were particularly this, we don't see the Vice President. There are people who are online [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2100.2s)]
*  and even in real life saying, well, I don't really know what she does. Well, that's the function of [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2104.76s)]
*  the Vice Presidency first. But also she was quite very active. But we made the case. She's just asked [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2108.36s)]
*  what our thoughts were and the analysis of it all. We're like, look, you were doing a lot, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2114.36s)]
*  but you have to go the extra mile and do all the things, go to the places that the people read, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2118.04s)]
*  watch and listen to. So yes, the local press, but the nationals need to do some sit downs with the [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2121.88s)]
*  columnists because they think they know all. And if you're not talking to them, they're mean. But [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2126.68s)]
*  we still have to talk to them. And so she herself decided that she wanted to do more. She [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2131.24s)]
*  had more off the records with reporters. She did a number of, now she does an end of the year [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2136.68s)]
*  interview every year, a bunch of them. That's something that she herself decided she wanted [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2141.24s)]
*  to do. And so the way she approaches the interview is she wants to come with, how can I, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2144.6s)]
*  if abortion is a thing we're going to talk about, how can I make this as plainly relatable as [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2150.68s)]
*  possible? She doesn't want a bunch of random facts and figures. When we used to travel with her, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2154.92s)]
*  she would ask for, when we were on the campaign trail in 2020, she would ask for like three figures [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2160.28s)]
*  about housing, gas. And there was one other thing and it's everywhere we went. She wants these three [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2164.44s)]
*  figures for this specific place. And it's like, dang, why? I mean, we were in France once doing a [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2168.92s)]
*  press conference at the end of this long trip and she's like, well, what is the price of gas? [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2174.92s)]
*  And I'm like, well, man, my driver SUV, so you want the average price? She was like, I don't see it [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2180.6800000000003s)]
*  in the documents. And I'm like, and I'm like, no, the French don't care about the price of gas, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2187.32s)]
*  but you know what? The people who will watch the clips at home in America, they do. And that's what [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2193.2400000000002s)]
*  she was thinking about. And so I think frankly, she is excellent in an interview. She wants to [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2198.44s)]
*  break it down and make it relatable. But sometimes I think the right has taken, my conservative [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2203.56s)]
*  friends will take some of the clips and they want to make fun of the relatability that she herself [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2208.68s)]
*  has been intentional about. And I believe what we've been seeing now is in fact that they have [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2213.56s)]
*  misread the room. Everything from the coconuts to the see what can be unburdened by what has been, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2218.52s)]
*  that resonates with people because they relate, like they feel that viscerally. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2223.88s)]
*  So I think the strategy that the campaign has employed here is smart. I have been critical [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2228.92s)]
*  in the last three weeks, I would argue, because I feel like that the Democratic Party writ large, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2233.96s)]
*  but specifically the Harris Walls campaign, not the vice president herself, but some of the people [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2239.4s)]
*  that work up in there, were kind of taking the base vote for granted a little bit. Thought that [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2243.8s)]
*  they could just maybe earn media their way to the base vote or just, you know, they did that already. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2249.1600000000003s)]
*  They had records spending early, so now they need to pivot and get some of these moderate [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2253.8s)]
*  Republicans on and so forth. And I think you have to do both, it sounded either or. And these series [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2257.8s)]
*  of interviews that she has set up, to me says that in addition to some of the things that they're [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2262.44s)]
*  doing online and some of the advice that they've done, that they understand that they still have to [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2267.7200000000003s)]
*  persuade base voters, i.e. there are people who, believe it or not, think that their vote doesn't [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2272.84s)]
*  matter. There are people out there who have maybe voted in the past, who say, I just don't know if [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2278.76s)]
*  my vote is going to make a difference. And she is going out there talking about the issues, but also [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2284.44s)]
*  from the candidates own mouth saying, your vote can make a difference. It made me the first woman, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2289.5600000000004s)]
*  the first woman of color, the first black woman vice president, and your vote can make a difference [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2296.0400000000004s)]
*  for all these things in your life. So I think it's smart. And some of the media colleagues, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2300.44s)]
*  like that, they wrote about it today. They said, oh, why is she, literally someone wrote. Oh, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2304.04s)]
*  oh, they wrote it. They wrote it. It's coming. It's coming. All of these scheduled interviews, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2309.56s)]
*  they were all out today. At least the report, the news that she was going to do them all is [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2313.32s)]
*  all out today. And Politico saw all of these scheduled interviews. And the playbook wrote the [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2317.2400000000002s)]
*  following. Kamala Harris is still largely avoiding the media. The VP is set for a series of interviews [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2324.52s)]
*  that likely won't press her on tough issues, even as voters want more specifics. Love it, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2332.36s)]
*  what do you think? We were on a plane to Philly here. The plane was a little delayed, and we were [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2338.52s)]
*  sitting there for a while. And there were some tweets. There were some tweets flying. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2347.8s)]
*  So look, we have made the point that we can't just spend all our time arguing about what [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2353.0s)]
*  Washington media is saying, that we have to get out there. That's not the most important thing. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2359.32s)]
*  But sometimes it doesn't have to be the most important thing to be something you really want [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2362.92s)]
*  to do for a second. And we've earned it. Look, she just came off an interview with the National [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2366.6800000000003s)]
*  Association of Black Journalists. Tim Walls was on Fox News Sunday today. As Playbook publishes [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2374.0400000000004s)]
*  this, clips are coming out of Kamala Harris being asked difficult questions about Israel and Gaza [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2380.2000000000003s)]
*  by 60 Minutes. You know, those pop culture softies. She's on 60 Minutes, the nation's [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2386.36s)]
*  premier tough interview show. A show so famous for its tough interviews that they don't have music. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2393.0s)]
*  They have a ticking stopwatch. She's doing Univision. She's doing a bunch of local press. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2398.6s)]
*  And what bothers me, in addition to doing The Late Show and Howard Stern, she's doing ostensibly [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2406.76s)]
*  exactly what you would think a political journalist would be excited to see a [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2412.84s)]
*  presidential candidate do, which is talk to all kinds of journalists of all types to try to reach [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2416.1200000000003s)]
*  as many people as possible facing difficult questions, personal questions, policy questions, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2421.48s)]
*  the works. And instead they write that. And look, we can file this away. It's a problem for another [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2426.92s)]
*  day. In a good relationship, when someone takes out the garbage, their partner says, thank you. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2432.36s)]
*  I appreciate that you do these wonderful things for us. In a bad relationship, when someone takes [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2438.44s)]
*  out the garbage, the partner says, fucking finally. When someone is doing the thing you have urged [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2442.52s)]
*  them to do, even if the urging was not totally fair, you should be glad they're doing it. You [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2449.64s)]
*  should celebrate it because presumably journalists, I like that journalists advocate for journalism. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2454.84s)]
*  I like that they're out there wanting Kamala Harris to do more interviews. We've said Kamala [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2459.0s)]
*  Harris should do more interviews. But when someone is doing the thing in a democracy that you believe [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2462.7599999999998s)]
*  is important to a democracy, you don't have to go out of your way to kick them in the nuts. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2466.36s)]
*  Stupid. It's stupid. And it's like political journalism is less and less relevant. You have [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2471.08s)]
*  to go around it more and more to reach actual people. And this is like a little campaign for [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2476.12s)]
*  their own irrelevancy. It's like they don't want the credibility. They don't want to be part of the [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2480.2s)]
*  conversation. It's like she's doing democracy. You want to do democracy. There's another candidate [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2484.92s)]
*  who'd like to destroy it. He backed out of the same 60 minutes interview. Like maybe that's [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2490.2s)]
*  something worth focusing on. Yeah. I frankly think this is indicative of the coverage of the way that [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2495.16s)]
*  the political media covered her prior to her becoming, locking down the nomination and becoming [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2503.8799999999997s)]
*  the top of the ticket. And I had long since believed, I said, you know, they are gonna, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2510.6s)]
*  they, they, for lack of a better term, they're going to take a turn. Like, what does this say? [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2514.68s)]
*  Any more specifics when every interview she's telling you? What is it? Like you can say you [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2518.68s)]
*  don't like the specifics that she's giving. You could be critical about the plan that she's put [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2523.16s)]
*  forward, but the idea that there is no plan is just, it's, it's unserious, especially when the man on [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2527.0s)]
*  the other side seems to not know what a tariff is and doesn't understand child care. Yeah. And he, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2531.64s)]
*  he spent part of his rally in Wisconsin today demanding an apology from Leslie Stahl in 60 [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2541.7999999999997s)]
*  minutes and said, once he gets the apology, he'll go back and do the interview. For what? [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2547.08s)]
*  You have Leslie Stahl the turn. He told the truth. Leslie Stahl knows what Leslie Stahl did. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2551.4s)]
*  I'm sure that will lead playbook tomorrow, but I do think they confuse like a substantive interview [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2556.92s)]
*  with an adversarial interview. Right. And like, if you listen to the interview she did with Alex [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2561.7200000000003s)]
*  Cooper on Call Her Daddy, it was extremely substantive. She got into a lot of details [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2567.2400000000002s)]
*  about policy. Now, did Alex try to ask her a bunch of like gotcha questions? No, but she also wasn't [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2572.52s)]
*  like, what's your favorite caller? Like it was like a serious, like a 538 polling average. Like [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2577.88s)]
*  it wasn't horse race. Yeah. Here's the thing. It's not substantive adversarial. It's us for someone [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2582.2000000000003s)]
*  else. Cause it drives the beltway media fucking bananas. And someone like Alex Cooper has a [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2587.2400000000002s)]
*  platform exponentially larger than they do listen to by more people and she can have the interview [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2592.52s)]
*  and not them. Yeah. They are reckoning with declining relevance and decaying platforms in [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2597.1600000000003s)]
*  this media environment. But by the way, like that's not a good thing. That's the thing that's [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2602.92s)]
*  frustrating. It's like, I like we live in the wreckage of local news going away, political [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2607.0s)]
*  journalism, not reaching enough people, people casting about for information and landing on [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2612.36s)]
*  stuff. That's only sometimes true. Like that is a bad thing. Like we want, I want those institutions [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2616.52s)]
*  to succeed. I want them to do the kind of coverage that like people go to because they want news. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2621.32s)]
*  They can trust from the middle of an after in the wake of a storm of people grabbing onto [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2625.96s)]
*  bullshit and lies. Like we need institutions that people trust. And like, this is a very small, [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2630.68s)]
*  ultimately not important example of it, but like I want these institutions to do the kind of [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2635.08s)]
*  journalism that people can rely on and like to be angry that she's only doing 60 minutes Univision, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2640.12s)]
*  the National Association of Black Journalists and Fox News Sunday. These pretty fucking ridiculous. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2645.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Dan, in these final weeks, how do you think about balancing between media, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2649.48s)]
*  media appearances that introduce the VP to people, interviews that focus on specific topics, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2659.64s)]
*  more traditional interviews like 60 minutes. And then how do you weigh all that against the need [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2664.44s)]
*  to continue to do rallies? Like she's obviously, she's got a lot of voters to reach and she's got [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2668.36s)]
*  a lot of messages to get out there and there's only four weeks left. That's exhausting when you [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2673.0s)]
*  say there are only four weeks left. I know. Towards the end of my time in the White House as Barack [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2678.44s)]
*  Obama's communications director, I kind of realized that much of my job was kind of pointless. And [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2682.6s)]
*  that so much of my job was spent. And here you are. Exactly. Just that basically the conclusion [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2689.0s)]
*  of that so much time was spent, the politicians talking to DC media, DC media writing about us [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2696.04s)]
*  responding to it. It was all a giant circle jerk because none of that was reaching real voters. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2702.84s)]
*  The people who actually, it was just political junkies talking to each other through the pages [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2709.4s)]
*  of Politico, the New York Times, the Washington Post. That's what it was. And the media environment [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2713.8s)]
*  has changed even more dramatically since then because of changes in the internet and social [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2718.36s)]
*  media. Now the biggest gap in politics is not between the right and the left, it's between [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2722.6800000000003s)]
*  the small minority of Americans who actively seek out political news and everyone else who almost [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2726.44s)]
*  never encounter it. Right now if you want to know what's happening in politics, you have to seek it [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2731.48s)]
*  out. You have to subscribe to Potsdam America, read Playbook, read the New York Times, watch MSNBC. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2736.04s)]
*  And most people don't do that and it's no longer delivered to them in their Facebook feed or their [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2740.76s)]
*  Twitter feed or anywhere else. And so Kamala Harris has a gigantic challenge in this election. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2745.08s)]
*  It is a challenge that no, much harder than any candidate's ever had and she's having to do it on [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2751.08s)]
*  a compressed timeline. And the way I think you do that is to sort of an adopt approach, I like to [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2755.48s)]
*  call sort of everything everywhere all at once. She has to be all over the press, right? You have [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2760.6s)]
*  to do 60 minutes and you have to call her daddy. You have to do Univision Town Hall and Simone Show, [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2765.72s)]
*  right? You got to do Pod Save America and all the smoke podcasts. You have to do it all [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2771.4s)]
*  and because you have to recognize that you have to recognize that the most the most the [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2775.7200000000003s)]
*  voters she needs and one she needs to persuade and most of them aren't when we say persuadable [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2781.88s)]
*  voters we have in our mind people who are just sitting there like with white stacks of white [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2784.84s)]
*  papers on either side of the dining room table trying to decide between Trump and Kamala Harris. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2788.6s)]
*  And that's not what it is. It's most people deciding between voting for someone and sitting on the [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2792.84s)]
*  couch. And the way you reach them is by going to where they are, right? It's why you do call [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2797.16s)]
*  her daddy, right? Yes, you can see this was in playbooks like well she's already doing so well [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2803.0s)]
*  with young women so why would she go and call her daddy? It's like what the fuck do you guys know [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2807.3199999999997s)]
*  about politics because you know what dude does not have a super high turnout rate? Voters under 30. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2811.48s)]
*  And the other thing is as you think about your interviews because no individual interview is [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2816.44s)]
*  worth the time of a presidential nominee. What it is is you have the interview and then it has to [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2820.2s)]
*  travel outside of that, right? What is people what is not understood by these dinosaurs in DC [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2826.04s)]
*  about the media is that there are people who listen to Alex Cooper on Spotify or their podcast app or [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2832.84s)]
*  whatever else but those clips travel on TikTok all the time. Even if you don't listen to that podcast [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2840.2s)]
*  you will see clips of Kamala Harris talking to Alex Cooper. The same thing and Trump is doing this [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2845.0s)]
*  and he's doing it quite well, right? He is all the time we're like where is he? He's not doing [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2849.96s)]
*  he's skipping 60 minutes but what he's doing is he's doing Theo Vonn's podcast, Sean Ryan's podcast, [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2854.6s)]
*  he's doing stuff with TikTokers like Aiden Ross and he's out there we have to have our version of [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2859.08s)]
*  that and so you got to do it all. You got a university under 60 minutes and you got to do [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2863.08s)]
*  this stuff and you just have to not give a shit about what Politico and the DC media say about it. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2866.36s)]
*  Yeah. So Tommy, CNN had a report on Sunday morning that Harris is contemplating more ways to visibly [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2871.3199999999997s)]
*  break with the Biden presidency. It didn't really specify any areas where that might happen [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2882.84s)]
*  but do you think that's smart? Do you think it's feasible? I think it's essential. I mean I think [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2887.7200000000003s)]
*  this isn't really a criticism of Biden as much as the political reality when you look everywhere [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2893.4s)]
*  in the world and you see people who are pissed off about the pandemic, about COVID, the pandemic is [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2900.28s)]
*  COVID, about energy prices, inflation, a whole range of things and they're punishing incumbent [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2907.56s)]
*  parties of all stripes and so I think Kamala Harris doesn't want to be seen as running for [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2913.88s)]
*  a second Biden term. I think there's also you know so part of the way you make a break is [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2919.24s)]
*  tonal. Joe Biden was very focused on frustratingly so candidly on telling people about the things he [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2926.92s)]
*  had done and trying to get credit for accomplishments whereas if you watch a Kamala Harris event she's [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2935.56s)]
*  talking about understanding that people are still frustrated, that they are you know feeling the [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2941.08s)]
*  pinch from inflation but here are the things that I will do to help you and I think that tonal [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2946.84s)]
*  difference has been really important. Part of though any effort to sort of create some distance [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2950.2799999999997s)]
*  is going to involve the Biden White House playing ball as well and that story you mentioned the [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2957.48s)]
*  CNN story talked about how some of Kamala Harris's aides were a little bit frustrated that he went [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2963.0s)]
*  out and talked to the press corps after the Liz Cheney endorsement and sort of started singing [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2968.2000000000003s)]
*  Dick Cheney's praises because that didn't land well in a lot of progressive circles. There was [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2972.6s)]
*  also an incident where President Biden went to the White House briefing room for the first time [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2977.08s)]
*  in his first term. It's funny to refer to it as an incident. The President Biden went to the briefing [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2981.0s)]
*  room for the first time and he ended up speaking at the same time as Kamala Harris's event and I [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2987.4s)]
*  think they felt like it stepped on that a bit. The area where I think it's going to be really hard [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2993.48s)]
*  is on policy because I know like a lot of progressives want Kamala Harris to articulate [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=2998.04s)]
*  a different position on Gaza for example and we're recording this you know a day before the one year [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3003.2400000000002s)]
*  anniversary of the October 7th Hamas attack on Israel which is just a horrific day for everyone [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3008.6800000000003s)]
*  in Israel. It's been a horrific year for Jews in America and around the world who are fearing the [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3015.64s)]
*  rise of anti-Semitism, for Palestinians in Gaza obviously, for you know Arab and Muslim Americans [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3021.56s)]
*  who just want you know the carnage to end for people with connections to Lebanon now. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3028.2s)]
*  But the challenge for Kamala Harris is you know she's going to be in the situation room meetings [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3033.64s)]
*  but Joe Biden is the President and he is going to make the call and there's one President at a time [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3038.52s)]
*  and that is a sacrosanct thing that you can't change and Joe Biden has very strong views on this. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3043.4s)]
*  So it's going to be a challenge to create that space. I think a lot of it is going to be [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3049.0s)]
*  rhetorical but I do think it's important for her to try. Can I just say that I don't necessarily [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3054.52s)]
*  agree. I think her tone has been different but different because that is authentic to her [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3062.28s)]
*  and I think that it has really been important for her to be authentic to herself and as you all know [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3067.32s)]
*  when you're the Vice President your name is on the door but it's number two on the door okay [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3071.72s)]
*  and nobody's asking you what you think until you're in the room and the President might ask [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3075.64s)]
*  and y'all can have a conversation but at the end of the day it is the President's decision [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3079.9599999999996s)]
*  but there is no one more loyal, more proud to serve with Joe Biden than Vice President Kamala [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3084.12s)]
*  Harris and I read all the stories about how the aides want this and the aides want that. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3092.2s)]
*  I can tell you with with visceral and aggressive uncertainty if the time comes and people are like [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3097.0s)]
*  the only way you'll get it is if you step on Joe Biden's back, stab him in the back and step up. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3106.2s)]
*  She will not do that but I don't think that that is in fact necessary to be very clear. She is [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3110.76s)]
*  the nominee right now because Joe Biden had her back when there are many other people that want [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3115.88s)]
*  to walk around right about now outside talk about how yeah she was always our person. They [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3119.72s)]
*  weren't endorsed in an open primary so an open process at an open convention so I would just say [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3125.08s)]
*  what is I think the campaign aides instead of whining about what the President is doing because [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3129.88s)]
*  he is still the President okay okay maybe his second biggest defender is me because I just you [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3134.6s)]
*  know instead of whining about what the President is doing maybe they should do the work of reminding [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3142.7599999999998s)]
*  people it's been 30 years since the sitting Vice President of the United States has actually [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3147.08s)]
*  run for been the nominee the last person was Al Gore. How about you ask out did somebody ask [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3150.6s)]
*  Bill Clinton how he would have felt if Al Gore was out here just willy yoloing it? [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3156.12s)]
*  Well I think I think that did actually happen. How the hell did that work out for Al Gore? [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3159.64s)]
*  That's so good. Okay so my only point is is that like she she has I think differentiated herself. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3164.8399999999997s)]
*  The aides want her to throw Joe Biden some they want her to throw Joe Biden under the bus. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3172.8399999999997s)]
*  She's not going to do it and frankly the people who are who are seeding the things out there in [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3177.7999999999997s)]
*  the press it is it is showing that they do not know her that well because that is not something [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3181.8799999999997s)]
*  that is going to move her it's actually just going to piss her off. You're right I mean she's a loyal [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3186.52s)]
*  person she's a good person I would never recommend she throw Joe Biden under the bus but I think Joe [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3190.68s)]
*  Biden should know or I think he does know that his legacy depends on her winning and whatever it takes [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3195.8799999999997s)]
*  for her to win he should do she should do and that will be based on data and polling and not [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3203.32s)]
*  personal cruelty or some petty bullshit from staffers which you had to deal with more than [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3209.48s)]
*  we did you know like so you understand this but every day I think I think shout out to Ben LeBolt [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3214.1200000000003s)]
*  he is a lovely person. I love Ben LeBolt. I don't know that she has to separate herself on policy [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3219.0800000000004s)]
*  because I don't think that's necessarily credible. I'm not sure it's possible. It is tone it's really [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3228.1200000000003s)]
*  funny the folks at Blueprint who do they're a polling organization they're more moderate [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3231.4s)]
*  leading but they have been arguing that swing voters want her to separate herself from Biden [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3235.7200000000003s)]
*  but the most popular testing message they did was the message I'm not Joe Biden and then just [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3239.96s)]
*  restated the positions on health care and prescription drugs and it and the takeaway from that [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3244.92s)]
*  is not that I mean Joe Biden is less popular than Kamala Harris but that the point here is it is [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3250.28s)]
*  that the best framework for this election is future versus past it's not present versus recent [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3254.6800000000003s)]
*  it's past and so the extent that she is charting a path forward and not relitigating the Biden [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3260.12s)]
*  administration is where she's going to be strongest. Yeah I think I think a number of things can be [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3266.04s)]
*  true here which is she is clearly and you could tell this in when she was asked the question in [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3270.3599999999997s)]
*  the first sit down interview she did with CNN she is clearly loves Joe Biden and feels loyal to Joe [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3275.96s)]
*  Biden and I thought that that answer it was admirable that she did not take that opportunity [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3281.64s)]
*  even if it might have been more politically advantageous to do so at that time it's just [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3287.16s)]
*  like you could tell that's what she believes and I think if you're running for office [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3291.08s)]
*  just say what you believe right that's always a good rule of thumb it's also true that Joe Biden [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3294.68s)]
*  is very unpopular right and that I think is unfair I think we would all guess that that's unfair. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3298.92s)]
*  Yeah he's pretty unpopular. He's unpopular yes. No I think people think he's too he [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3306.36s)]
*  I think a lot of people thought he was supposed to be president but is the president himself unpopular? [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3310.52s)]
*  Yes I think I mean he's more popular now that he's not running for re-election no but let's [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3314.12s)]
*  be honest about this to me it's less about I agree with you actually I think I agree with John [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3317.3199999999997s)]
*  the moment she defended Joe Biden I think that's great I think we do not want to debate about how [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3321.4s)]
*  is Kamala Harris distancing herself from Joe Biden enough I think she's doing it on tone she [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3325.24s)]
*  should keep doing it on tone I think specifically on Israel and Gaza it is important for her to say [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3328.2799999999997s)]
*  there's only one president at a time to signal that she is not Joe Biden while she stands with [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3332.04s)]
*  Israel wants a two-state solution but I do think what we're also talking about here is how can Joe [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3335.72s)]
*  Biden be the most helpful and I think it's not necessarily going on the view or going to the [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3339.88s)]
*  brooding room it's not it might be Joe Biden saying the most helpful thing I can do is stand [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3344.04s)]
*  back and make sure that the contrast is not between the present and the future but I'm not [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3348.76s)]
*  it but between the future and the Trump past yeah as Dan was saying and that is less about what Kamala [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3353.32s)]
*  does actually it's more about Joe Biden understanding what the most important thing is which for his [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3358.44s)]
*  legacy which is Kamala winning. Yeah I mean like there's what should be true and there's what is [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3363.48s)]
*  true what should be true is that Joe Biden should be popular because he pulled us out of a pandemic [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3367.64s)]
*  and a recession and we have the strongest economy and fastest recovery that we've had right like [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3372.52s)]
*  that and then he's like had the best legislative accomplishments like you know biggest climate bill [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3377.3199999999997s)]
*  in history like yeah that's what should be true but it's not because we went through a pandemic [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3382.2799999999997s)]
*  and people are cranky and are his approval ratings with you know engaged Democrats really good yeah [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3386.92s)]
*  but like the people that we were all talking about tonight who don't pay a lot of attention [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3392.44s)]
*  that's not right and so like then the question is all right we have this new nominee what's the [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3395.8s)]
*  opportunity for her and you're right I don't think you can separate on policy that much because she [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3400.36s)]
*  was there for all of it and by the way a lot of the policy itself pretty popular and by the way if [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3405.96s)]
*  there was a separation on policy somebody would have challenged Joe Biden on an issue other than [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3410.44s)]
*  his age the reason there was no other nominees because Joe Biden was a great president and age [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3414.1200000000003s)]
*  was not a factor in his governing he did an extraordinary job so and she that didn't change [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3418.52s)]
*  when he stepped aside yeah I agree with you but that's why I do think it is it is how you present [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3423.8s)]
*  yourself in his past future right I think I even think in the debate when she said I'm not Joe Biden [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3428.44s)]
*  it's sort of it it works for people it's also sort of funny it's like obviously yeah no shit [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3432.92s)]
*  you know there's a lot of people she's not when you think about it I do think look the backdrop of [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3438.52s)]
*  the CNN story the politico stories all these Democrats a lot of aides talking on background [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3445.96s)]
*  all this kind of stuff everyone is nervous and they are nervous because we are nervous because [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3451.72s)]
*  the race is super close and some people are worried about complacency and caution from the [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3456.6s)]
*  Harris Walls campaign and that's just it's what happens every campaign but we are in a race against [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3463.48s)]
*  Donald Trump four weeks left it's been an unconventional campaign to say the least and things [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3468.9199999999996s)]
*  are extremely close I think there was some hope that some people had that like okay Kamala Harris [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3473.7999999999997s)]
*  new nominee now she'll be up five or six and that'll be that not the case it's going to be [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3478.36s)]
*  a dogfight right until the end this isn't a good place this is the bad place you guys think any [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3483.0s)]
*  of this is warranted you have similar worries someone how you feeling yeah I feel look I feel [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3489.4s)]
*  like I would just want to boulder underline with Dan said this idea that when people say when when [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3495.4s)]
*  I said when we say undecided voter I think an image pops into somebody's head a suburban white [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3500.92s)]
*  lady actually is what pops into lots of heads okay maybe a a moderate white man a rural working [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3505.24s)]
*  class union guy okay even though the black and brown people are in rule and our union as well [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3511.24s)]
*  and black women live in the suburbs Montgomery County actually as well yes yes yes yes yes [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3516.68s)]
*  it's where our special was black woman America so I I do think that there are people have to [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3522.12s)]
*  rethink what they think about undecideds because they're undecided based voters who are like [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3526.2s)]
*  I don't know if my vote matters or I don't know if I'm going to vote for her not that I'm voting [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3531.4s)]
*  for Trump but I might stay home or I might leave the top of the ticket blank and because of that [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3535.6400000000003s)]
*  I do think that people have to walk and chew gum at the same time yes you I there has to be appeals [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3540.0400000000004s)]
*  to moderate Republicans continue to roll out the endorsement of people like Liz Cheney and former [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3546.2000000000003s)]
*  Senator Jeff Blake and I do think that that matters but you cannot do that at the expense of [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3551.88s)]
*  your base because a Kamala Harris coalition includes base voters she is not the next president [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3557.0s)]
*  of the United States without them and I think she understands that but I think pieces of the [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3562.28s)]
*  democratic party apparatus sometimes forget that so that's what makes me anxious and when people [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3566.76s)]
*  say oh I'm undecided some folks out there want to shame these voters and I understand but I come [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3570.92s)]
*  from you know campaigns and in campaigns we just we understand where the people are we need to drag [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3576.44s)]
*  them to where we need them to be and then we shame them after election day that's that that's great [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3581.08s)]
*  we'll leave it there leave it there all right before we get to our interview with Senator Bob [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3585.96s)]

*  this is a unique race in lots of ways not simply because he lied to the people of our state about [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3771.96s)]
*  where he lives he told them over and over and over again all throughout 2022 all throughout 2023 [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3777.72s)]
*  even before he was a candidate that he lived in Pennsylvania said it over and over again then on [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3785.3999999999996s)]
*  August not that I remember but August the 14th of 2023 the Associated Press wrote a story that said [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3790.9199999999996s)]
*  actually he lives in Connecticut and they had they had they had evidence to prove that [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3798.7599999999998s)]
*  so that's become a major issue because if you haven't been here if you've been even he didn't [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3805.72s)]
*  vote in the state for 15 years if you haven't been here you're not going to understand the state and [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3811.7999999999997s)]
*  you should not lie to the people that you seek to represent I think that's a pretty low bar [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3816.92s)]
*  and it's not it's not just he lives in Connecticut now he's also been a little fuzzy should we say [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3823.48s)]
*  about the family farm he grew up on and a bunch of other things right yeah he said the New York [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3830.12s)]
*  Times wrote this story where they talked about where the New York Times recounted what he was [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3836.2s)]
*  saying when he was a candidate for the Senate in 2022 he said at one point something to the effect [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3840.12s)]
*  that he came from nothing he had nothing his father was a university president and when you [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3845.88s)]
*  literally it was called Bloomsburg College then now it's Bloomsburg University when you're president [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3852.12s)]
*  of a college university usually get a house they got a house right so he had a pretty good [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3858.2s)]
*  upbringing but then later he even went further and said because his family owned a farm and [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3862.8399999999997s)]
*  he spent some time on it he actually said at one point I'm a farmer which is I mean that's that's [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3867.7999999999997s)]
*  really interesting the way he brought that into the conversation but but Dan here's here's one of [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3875.3999999999996s)]
*  the I think this is what what sets it apart from any race in the country obviously my my good friend [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3880.8399999999997s)]
*  John Tester and Sherrod Brown we were all elected together Montana go ahead they're [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3886.92s)]
*  just remarkably capable public officials and decent people in really tough races [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3893.88s)]
*  John has the toughest race in the country Sherrod a second unfortunately for me I'm third because [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3899.96s)]
*  but the unique feature about our race which I think sets it apart from any other is [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3909.7200000000003s)]
*  there's a singular super PAC that's funded by billionaires the leaders of which are all [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3913.96s)]
*  out-of-state billionaires that that we thought would grow to 20 or 30 now it's close to 50 [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3921.4s)]
*  and it might grow to 60 or 70 million but but that super PAC is supporting him morning noon and night [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3927.48s)]
*  pounding the hell out of me and that sets it apart from any other senate race in the country [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3933.72s)]
*  it'll be we believe the largest individual super PAC ever in in American politics for one candidate [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3938.68s)]
*  so if you can just go to Bob Casey.com tonight but I think that's the unique feature of the race I [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3946.3599999999997s)]
*  think it's worth just like honing in on that because in addition just simply polluting the [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3953.72s)]
*  airwaves during Phillies and Eagles games like it's worth just noting like yes these guys are [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3958.12s)]
*  friends with these rich billionaire hedge fund guys they're probably part of the same country [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3963.3999999999996s)]
*  club or yacht club or whatever else with Dave McCormick but they have a real interest in [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3967.08s)]
*  electing someone like Dave McCormick and defeating someone like you so maybe talk a little bit about [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3971.7999999999997s)]
*  that. I'd say bingo look they they know that when there was a tax bill in 2017 remember what [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3975.16s)]
*  happened Republicans rammed through a tax bill they did it through reconciliation that narrow [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3982.84s)]
*  process that allows you to vote with get get 51 votes they got their 51 votes and that that bill [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3988.6s)]
*  alone jacked up the debt by two trillion dollars mostly because they gave a huge cut in the [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=3995.16s)]
*  corporate rate the likes of which I'm not sure we've ever seen and the billionaires and the [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4002.12s)]
*  hundreds of millionaire guys got a big tax break when that happened they knew that they're going [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4006.52s)]
*  to have to come back to it in 2025. McCormick's already committed to voting for a similar version [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4012.44s)]
*  of that which will jack up the debt not by two trillion not by three trillion but by most estimates [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4018.6s)]
*  more than four trillion dollars so they know he's going to vote for it and they know I'm going to [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4024.6s)]
*  vote against it that's in their interest to support him because he's going to support them on the tax [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4029.48s)]
*  bill and they also a lot of these billionaires also have a lot to say about how we have to you [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4034.2799999999997s)]
*  know limit spending for Medicare and Social Security and Medicaid. You had your first debate [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4039.3199999999997s)]
*  earlier this week was that an enjoyable experience would you say? I wouldn't go that far. One of the [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4045.7999999999997s)]
*  big issues in that debate and it's something that's come up in the campaign repeatedly is [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4053.8s)]
*  fracking. McCormick has repeatedly tried to portray you as someone who is anti-fracking [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4057.32s)]
*  can you set the set the record straight on your position on fracking? I've always supported it [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4061.96s)]
*  and the key to that I think that the key to that issue in terms of what happens in the state is [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4066.6800000000003s)]
*  who is the governor and we know that Josh Shapiro is someone who's supported [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4073.32s)]
*  gas extraction. He's also someone go ahead and clap for Josh. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4079.72s)]
*  Governor Shapiro is also someone who will enforce the law because that's where most of the regulation [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4089.4s)]
*  occurs at the state level. It matters who the governor is to enforce the environmental laws. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4095.16s)]
*  We've got a state constitutional provision it's article one section 27 of our state's constitution [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4100.84s)]
*  that people have a right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the historic, [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4107.48s)]
*  scenic, and natural values, aesthetics of the environment. So because of that constitutional [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4112.839999999999s)]
*  mandate it's up to the governor and those who do the oversight of this process of extracting natural [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4119.639999999999s)]
*  gas to enforce those laws. So we have a lot of listeners maybe here in Pennsylvania but also [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4127.879999999999s)]
*  around the country who want to support your campaign who are very concerned about climate [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4133.5599999999995s)]
*  change and so and they hear something someone say that they're here that you support fracking and [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4136.92s)]
*  maybe they don't understand the role fracking plays in the economy here in Pennsylvania but [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4141.24s)]
*  maybe you could talk a little for those voters and talk a little bit more about your broader efforts [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4145.16s)]
*  efforts to address climate change and maybe making sure that we keep our our water and air as clean [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4148.92s)]
*  as possible. Yeah one of the I think one of the most important moments in in the recent history [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4153.96s)]
*  of the Senate at least on our side was when we passed the inflation reduction act which allowed us [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4160.12s)]
*  and by the way with only democratic votes not a single republican supported that allowed us to say [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4167.24s)]
*  by the by the time that law passed in in 2022 I guess August of 22 that we could we could achieve [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4173.96s)]
*  40 by 30 a 40 reduction in emissions by 2030 solely because of that law the most important [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4182.12s)]
*  20 by 30 solely because of that law the most important [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4189.56s)]
*  climate change legislation in in human history if not American history but there's more we have to [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4193.72s)]
*  do 20 by 30 is is a substantial progress but there's more we're gonna have to do reduce emissions. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4201.72s)]
*  Dave McCormick recently released a very gauzy ad talking trying to portray himself as a moderate [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4210.120000000001s)]
*  abortion and calling you an extremist on abortion because you maybe I mean we have both equal part [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4215.24s)]
*  boos and laughs in the audience on that but I'm sure they've seen that ad a hundred million times [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4221.24s)]
*  in the last few weeks. Maybe you could explain what the differences are between you and McCormick [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4225.96s)]
*  on abortion and why electing you in a democratic Senate matters so much reproductive freedom. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4233.08s)]
*  Yeah here's here's the moment it's it's 2022 and remember the the Dove's decision was leaked [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4238.44s)]
*  remember that so we had a sense of it and then of course the the final decision came out in June [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4243.8s)]
*  of 22 right around that time my opponent was a candidate for the United States Senate and he was [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4250.04s)]
*  running in that primary and he turned he was he was trying to run to the right of Dr. Oz who [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4256.28s)]
*  ultimately won the primary and in a in a debate debate among Republican candidates the the debate [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4261.400000000001s)]
*  moderator the same moderator that we had the other night in Harrisburg Dennis Owen said [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4270.6s)]
*  what exceptions would you support if in an abortion ban or some some words to that effect [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4275.240000000001s)]
*  and my opponent said the rare instance of life of the mother and he stopped and then he never [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4282.6s)]
*  corrected the record on that and then when he started running for the Senate he started saying [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4289.8s)]
*  oh no no I forgot I forgot there are two other exceptions that I should have had in there so [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4293.4800000000005s)]
*  that's one proof point but the second proof point is basic it's will you vote to restore [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4298.44s)]
*  the protections of Roe v Wade or not I will and have he won't that's the difference and he we [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4305.639999999999s)]
*  would assume vote for a federal abortion ban if that's what the Magna Republic is that Trump [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4313.48s)]
*  wanted right he's denying that he's denying that he's a man who also lies about where he lives so [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4318.36s)]
*  I'm not sure I take that one to the bank right that's a good line actually it's all yours [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4323.8s)]
*  some folks in the audience or listeners episode may not know this but you love political maps [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4331.0s)]
*  uh some actually only one map yes one map yes you love the political map some people and by [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4336.84s)]
*  some people I largely mean me they call you the Steve Kornacki of the Senate and so in that [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4341.96s)]
*  vein I think we might have a map coming out here oh wow it is [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4347.16s)]
*  Tommy thanks so much for your help with that it's right [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4357.64s)]
*  so on election night this is the state that it's going to decide the presidency the white [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4362.12s)]
*  out the senate and everything else cheering your battleground state status I appreciate that [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4368.04s)]
*  and so we're going to be watching the vote totals in Pennsylvania very carefully so maybe you could [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4375.160000000001s)]
*  walk us through what you're going to be looking for on election night yeah this is this was just [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4380.280000000001s)]
*  it'll be hard for some people to see so we'll try to explain what the counties are yeah we'll talk [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4386.360000000001s)]
*  about them yeah but uh Dan this was retrieved from the Smithsonian because as you can see it's from [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4390.120000000001s)]
*  2020 and there's a lot of scribbling on here I just want to explain what it is like for example [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4396.76s)]
*  in Potter County before election night I wrote down minus 46 that's not that's not good these [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4402.52s)]
*  are counties we won't win but this was this was what President Obama lost Potter County by 46 [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4410.120000000001s)]
*  and then what Secretary Clinton lost it by and then we left a space and I all the all night long [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4416.76s)]
*  I was filling in so for example that's one example let's go to some good news like in Chester County [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4421.64s)]
*  how many buddy from here Chester County this was a Republican County the last of the four to go [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4427.16s)]
*  to go Democratic President Obama actually lost it slightly by 0.2 percent [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4435.24s)]
*  Secretary Clinton won it by nine points President Biden won it by 17 so [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4442.04s)]
*  but here don't you just walk through what I hope go for it here's what I have to do to win and here's [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4449.88s)]
*  what Kamala Harris has to do by the way she's going to win this race right [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4455.48s)]
*  this is the this is the southeast but it's really the Philadelphia television market right [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4463.5599999999995s)]
*  so it's it's eight counties where we are right here we're here in Philly by the way it's great [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4468.599999999999s)]
*  to be at the Met this is a great place and it used to be a house of worship so it's sacred so [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4473.0s)]
*  it's sacred ground run but these eight counties this media market President Biden won that media [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4480.6s)]
*  market by plus 27 right he lost every other media market in the state and he won the state by one [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4485.88s)]
*  right so we've got to try to get that that margin out of there but also in Pittsburgh [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4496.52s)]
*  this is Allegheny County right but in this this media market which is 22 this is 41 percent of the [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4504.04s)]
*  vote this is 22 percent of the vote if if Kamala Harris and I are close to breaking even for this [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4510.92s)]
*  region it'll be a good night so and what what's the count specific county that you'll be looking [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4517.8s)]
*  for that you think maybe is a bellwether what's happening in the state this this is hazardous [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4527.16s)]
*  anybody from Bucks County out there it's not it's not precisely but you can see it wasn't it wasn't [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4532.68s)]
*  a good indicator of President Obama's margin because it's plus one and he won the state by five [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4544.12s)]
*  Secretary Clinton won it by one but she was minus she was she was minus one for the state [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4548.84s)]
*  President President Biden won Bucks by four won the state by one so it's not precise but that's a [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4555.08s)]
*  pretty good barometer there but the two counties that most people paid attention to last time were [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4561.88s)]
*  flip counties Obama and then that other guy in 16 and then President Biden Northampton and Erie [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4567.88s)]
*  right so Erie went from minus two to plus one Northampton went from minus four to plus point [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4575.72s)]
*  seven so those two counties are indicative but look a lot is going to come down to the southeast [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4585.08s)]
*  these these eight counties and what about Lackawanna County where Scranton is [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mCsJHXJgI&t=4591.5599999999995s)]
