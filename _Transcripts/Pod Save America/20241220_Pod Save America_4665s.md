Video Description: The world's richest man trolls Republicans into a potential government shutdown right before the holidays and the curtain closes on 2024...and it can't come soon enough. We didn't win the White House, the Senate, or the House, but we'll always have the Pundies. Jon, Lovett, Dan, and Tommy are joined by producer Elijah Cone for our annual awards show celebrating the worst takes of a year we'd rather forget. Plus, the guys listen back to their old New Year's resolutions and make some new ones for 2025.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

*  Tweeted us to the precipice of a government shutdown [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=135.6s)]
*  I [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=137.85999999999999s)]

*  Aesthetically not please so he started tweeting and then Trump got involved and then they they killed this bill that had been [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=147.73999999999998s)]
*  Negotiated with both parties very carefully it was gonna pass [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=154.29999999999998s)]
*  Killed the bill then they now there as we're recording [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=158.26s)]
*  There's like a new bill [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=161.54s)]
*  Doesn't seem like they have the Republican votes for that or the Democratic votes for that and the government runs out of money Friday night [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=162.98s)]
*  And who is the current president right and as that person involved at all do we know what that person there was about this [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=168.98s)]
*  There was a statement from the White House on Wednesday evening right? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=176.1s)]
*  That's all we've heard president Trump's been doing some postin some truths [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=180.06s)]
*  Elon Musk has been tweeting up a storm JD Vance. I think has been tweeting my favorite part is when Vivek [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=184.62s)]
*  Pretends he's an equal partner in this doge thing yeah, yeah, just like he's like you know Elon walks around with his kid on his shoulders [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=190.22s)]
*  at all times that's [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=197.14s)]
*  Little silly guy I guess I guess in the old version in the new version the new version of the bill which doesn't know if [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=199.42s)]
*  It's gonna go anywhere that that Trump and Musk approve of the big changes [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=204.66s)]
*  They were able to eliminate [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=209.57999999999998s)]
*  funding for childhood cancer research gotta stop so that losers kids with cancer winners [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=212.14s)]
*  Pharmaceutical middlemen [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=218.88s)]
*  Pharma managers and in China now we can we're allowed to invest more in China [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=221.12s)]
*  Yeah [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=225.4s)]
*  It's funny that Elon Musk does a lot of business in China a lot of factories a lot of Tesla's would want [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=225.64000000000001s)]
*  Restrictions on US outbound investment in China to get knocked out of the bill yeah, it's a coincidence [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=231.28s)]
*  So that's what we're watching Merry Christmas everyone wonder how it turns out Dan. What do you think anything any thought? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=235.76000000000002s)]

*  Joe Biden's absence from the scene it is time to make a bug a feature [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=246.04000000000002s)]
*  And let's let Donald Trump own this shutdown [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=251.0s)]
*  Yeah, just like this is between Mike Johnson Donald Trump Elon Musk have to figure this out amongst themselves [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=253.36s)]

*  Shih Tzu is better or worse than a Labrador is like no this one's better [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=344.56s)]

*  Better [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=354.28s)]
*  We'll start out up for an easy topic [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=356.52s)]
*  This is kind of to wet our take appetites from the beginning of the year Chris the presidential primaries remember those [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=358.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, no, no, we didn't really know we didn't have none on our side Dean Phillips. Yeah, Dean Phillips is part of this [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=364.35999999999996s)]
*  Here's a couple of takes. Let's start off with this piece from the hill after Trump wrapped up the nomination a piece titled [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=370.12s)]
*  Quote Trump's GOP is already dying. Here's an excerpt read by one of our wonderful Pod Save America producers [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=376.68s)]
*  Republicans have built themselves a party whose sole purpose is to appease and gratify Trump in the process [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=385.08s)]
*  They're quickly losing appeal to anyone in America including some of the party's most faithful warriors [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=391.44s)]
*  The MAGA movement once so skilled at enforcing loyalty is cracking [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=398.71999999999997s)]
*  Great reading first of all, that was beautiful. Wow, Grammy for spoken word like is that Adrian? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=406.12s)]
*  Wow you know for radio you got um, who was that? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=411.74s)]
*  I'm here you guys would react to each take as we go. Okay, just do them all no no [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=424.98s)]
*  No, but it's not like a guess who did the guess who was oh, yeah. No, no, you're just reacting to the reactions [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=429.18s)]
*  That one didn't pan out. Yeah [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=434.38s)]
*  It's gonna be a theme Tommy. Yeah, what did it were? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=436.78000000000003s)]
*  With it were true like there was a lot of that going around. Yeah, a lot of that probably probably some on this very [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=439.5s)]
*  Yeah, yeah for sure for sure some wish casting. Yeah, we're always talking about the crack showing this America [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=444.42s)]
*  We don't care about cracks [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=449.66s)]
*  I think we had I think we had like 45 episodes that had some kind of title about like Trump grip on the GOP loosens [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=450.62s)]
*  Trump question mark, but we always put a question mark. That's true. That's true. I checked ourselves boy was that answered [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=458.02s)]
*  We have a Santa's pill. We're just asking questions on this podcast. Yeah [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=463.02s)]
*  Anyway, all right next up we have billionaire Bill Ackman talking about Dean Phillips's chances to win the Democratic primary [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=467.5s)]
*  ahead of Michigan's primary [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=475.26s)]
*  Let's take a listen fine student very poorly in Michigan his polls are terrible. The Muslim community is not happy with him [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=477.18s)]
*  and [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=483.66s)]
*  He really has spent no time there and so if he's embarrassed in Michigan [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=486.02s)]
*  It could be catalyst for him withdrawing then Dean will get funding if he wins [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=490.5s)]
*  Michigan or shows well in Michigan and people say he's viable. He's the only choice we have [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=494.06s)]
*  He'll attract from the center [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=500.1s)]
*  He'll attract from people Republicans who won't vote for Trump in which there are a big percentage could be 60% or more [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=502.26s)]
*  It could be 70% won't vote for Trump and also from the Democrats. So I think he's a really interesting candidate [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=507.7s)]
*  That's just premature if only if only [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=514.98s)]
*  Just wrong not the primary the general right? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=518.74s)]
*  Lackman never misses that honestly, it's like that that take has that take it was it aged poorly and then it aged well again, right? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=521.3399999999999s)]
*  I don't know. I thought it no it started well [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=529.26s)]
*  It started off if you just write if you'd cut the first 20 seconds of that [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=531.2199999999999s)]
*  Well, I guess because he didn't he didn't end up competing in Michigan, right? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=534.38s)]
*  Well, I guess what I mean is just that like the the liabilities he was describing were correct. They ultimately did [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=537.9s)]
*  Become commas liabilities and cost us the country. So there was some truth in that but Dean but Dean [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=544.54s)]
*  He wasn't the way he wasn't the way a Cassandra if you will the best part about that take or the worst part [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=550.9s)]
*  I guess is the way in which Bill Ackman speaks so confidently about something. He does not understand at all [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=556.2199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's like I decided to just to just [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=562.5799999999999s)]

*  Maybe they're smarter than this even [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=576.3399999999999s)]
*  They're they're having a better holiday than we are [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=579.14s)]
*  And to round out the category here. We have another piece from the hill that was written after the election [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=582.1800000000001s)]
*  But it's about the 2028 primaries. It's titled America needs another Reagan [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=587.3000000000001s)]

*  Trump benefited from appearing on podcasts like the Ben Shapiro show [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=606.8399999999999s)]
*  Tim pool interviewed him and his appearances on Theo Vaughn and Joe Rogan helped secure his victory [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=610.4s)]
*  During the election Harris was tepid about doing podcasts and lean more toward the mainstream media, which appears to have cost her [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=615.8399999999999s)]
*  Haley on the other hand understands the appeal and has started her own podcast [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=623.04s)]
*  Way to a good day. I love these takes that are like mostly right and then [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=631.68s)]

*  You guys didn't get the memo that we're doing all hill takes for the punty's this year [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=751.94s)]
*  Justice for roll call yeah, that's what I'm saying [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=756.6600000000001s)]
*  All right, let's get to the good stuff appetizers eat and here come the main course [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=759.7800000000001s)]
*  the worst polling take of the year [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=764.38s)]
*  Oh [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=766.7s)]
*  This was a terrible year for polling or was it cross tabs are in the eye of the beholder [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=772.34s)]
*  Let's take a look at the worst polling takes of the year first up. We have Nate silver [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=777.7800000000001s)]
*  Nate's modeling was actually pretty accurate this cycle [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=782.82s)]
*  But in October he got in a Twitter fight where he made a big bet with a super rich investor named Keith Rabois [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=785.5200000000001s)]
*  Here's the exchange which will be done in a dramatic reading by our producers Saul and Farrah [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=792.78s)]
*  Nate you are a buffoon [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=799.42s)]
*  More likely 10 to 14 points, dude, you've got to stop huffing the Twitter vibes [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=803.8199999999999s)]
*  How much money are you willing to bet on a Trump plus eight point spread in Florida? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=808.5799999999999s)]
*  100k. Okay, have your lawyer drop a quick contract and it's a deal Nate dot silver dot media at gmail.com [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=812.9799999999999s)]
*  No contract no bet because you've been nutty lately on our payment risk [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=820.58s)]
*  Donald Trump won, Florida by 13 [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=825.86s)]
*  Did we ever get confirmation as to whether there was a deal do they ever send it? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=829.02s)]
*  Well, you know what happened is there was this was revisited. I hate that [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=832.5s)]
*  I know this this was revisited when the New York Times the other Nate dropped a poll about [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=835.9s)]
*  Florida a Florida poll in the weeks before the election that showed Trump I think up 13 in that [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=840.74s)]
*  13th Nate Cohn basically [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=847.18s)]
*  Nailed Florida and so when Nate dropped this poll then everyone started ragging on Nate silver about the bet [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=848.9399999999999s)]
*  But I don't think the bet had happened. Well lucky for Nate. I don't think it's right but boy is that a bad take. Yeah [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=854.56s)]
*  God just the confidence. It's like it's like how many of us have had takes that we were so sure of [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=859.6999999999999s)]
*  We put a hundred thousand dollars on the line [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=865.0999999999999s)]
*  It's it's also just like even where there are times where I like I feel sure of something [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=867.7399999999999s)]
*  I'm so chastened by the history of recent events [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=872.3399999999999s)]
*  And my awareness that the future will come you'll have to measure it against what he thought in the past [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=876.22s)]
*  Okay, all right [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=884.6600000000001s)]
*  Our next take is for a really nerdy topic for the polling sickos [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=886.1800000000001s)]
*  Yes, here's serial polling poster Adam Carlson talking about race [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=890.14s)]
*  Depolarization the theory that Trump wouldn't win a larger share of the black vote [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=895.14s)]
*  Speaking as a pollster it's wild to me that people take early polling at face value without question [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=900.38s)]
*  Even at the subgroup level believing wholeheartedly [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=907.42s)]
*  We're about to undergo mass racial depolarization simply because the polls told me so is an easy way to look silly in November [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=911.06s)]
*  Thank you to whoever found this one [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=920.9s)]
*  To his credit did not put a hundred thousand dollars behind it [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=929.5s)]
*  Yeah, and I think admitted he was wrong in the end. Yes to his credit. He did tweet out verbatim [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=932.86s)]
*  I was wrong about race depolarization race step for race step for the real nerds [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=938.26s)]
*  That's what they were all calling it and then mockingly but yeah, and even more importantly, it's a huge problem for the country [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=942.9s)]
*  What's happening? You know, although I think less racial polarization is helpful. I [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=948.5s)]
*  I [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=953.82s)]
*  Sure, I guess I guess I don't think we want to be polarized by race [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=955.82s)]
*  It's not helpful for us right now because we can't I mean in the battleground states [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=959.46s)]
*  I mean, you know be a less divided country if we're all Republicans, but that's also not the world [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=962.22s)]
*  I want to live in you know [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=967.1800000000001s)]
*  Just cuz we have trouble now getting white people to vote for us and black people and Latino people. Yeah, I'm calling that a problem [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=968.38s)]
*  That's a problem. Yeah, we just suck [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=974.46s)]
*  Yeah [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=977.62s)]
*  Anywho, what else you got? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=979.06s)]
*  No, you knew this was coming a couple of days before the election and seltzer dropped her famous Iowa poll [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=980.8199999999999s)]
*  It had Kamala Harris leading Trump by three in Iowa in reality Harris lost in Iowa to Trump by over 13 points [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=986.5799999999999s)]
*  Trump is now suing [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=994.16s)]
*  Here's a clip from friend of the pod Sarah long well reacting to the poll when it came out [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=998.3s)]
*  Never she's not been the wrong one [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1003.22s)]
*  Like there have been times where she has produced things that look like outlier results and [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1005.14s)]
*  What pollsters learn is that when and seltzer's poll looks like an outlier? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1009.86s)]
*  You better shift your polls to think more like hers [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1014.82s)]
*  It doesn't go the rare take that will appear on the ponies and in discovery [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1017.74s)]
*  Take so bad it might get you in thrown in jail [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1026.34s)]
*  In Sarah longwell's defense. She was right there. I mean seltzer has historically been right [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1029.54s)]
*  She has been someone who's been willing to put out polls that did not match the herded class [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1034.94s)]
*  But yeah, it ended up being very very wrong [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1039.9s)]
*  look we we all saw we were getting on a plane to to Vegas from Phoenix and we were [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1042.02s)]
*  We were cheering we were excited. We got ourselves exciting. Yeah, I think the I feel I feel like the interpretation that Sarah has there [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1048.5800000000002s)]
*  Is completely fine the hope that the that seltzer was right is completely fine [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1055.8200000000002s)]
*  She's taking enough shit for this poll and she had the kind of [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1060.18s)]
*  Courage over convictions to do a poll the way she was accustomed to doing it taking what the data showed her and releasing it [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1063.5s)]
*  Which is what a lot of pollsters refuse to do which is why all the polls hurt [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1069.6799999999998s)]

*  Republicans tried to do on Jan 6. The only difference is no one is storming the Capitol building [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1245.0600000000002s)]

*  So they might have deleted their account, but it was not some like rando with two followers [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1353.2s)]

*  We're not just gonna do the a single take we're gonna sample a take and then talk about the whole discourse because [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1728.78s)]
*  2024 was quite a year for discourse much like the toilet is quite a place for shit [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1735.8999999999999s)]

*  Hallie wrote that shout out [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1750.32s)]
*  First up we have the debate Commission discourse Joe Biden and Donald Trump organized their own debates this year instead of working through the [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1755.1200000000001s)]
*  Nonpartisan debate Commission many pearls were clutched [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1762.6200000000001s)]
*  But here's a particularly wonderful string of buzzwords from New Jersey Assemblyman and RFK junior advisor Jamal [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1766.1200000000001s)]
*  Holly he called the Commission on presidential debates quote an institution that has stood as a beacon of nonpartisanship [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1772.52s)]
*  Before saying this regrettably the sanctity and integrity of the debate process are now facing mounting challenges as [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1779.96s)]
*  Political operatives discreetly maneuvered behind the scenes to undermine the established norms and protocols that have long governed these crucial events [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1787.3200000000002s)]
*  So so the discourse is the is skipping the debate Commission. Yeah the norms and [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1796.68s)]
*  The protocols and rep the debate Commission. I said so that's about [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1804.0s)]
*  RFK jr. Believing according to the the rules that have traditionally been used that he would have gotten a slot at a presidential debate [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1809.24s)]
*  Which which might be true? [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1815.9s)]
*  And then there was a separate discourse about whether it was bad for the country that the debate Commission was basically [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1817.76s)]
*  Ignored and then the candidates spoke directly and figured out debates with the networks right the Commission on presidential debates was was formed in 1987 [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1824.28s)]
*  Didn't get a lot right either [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1836.36s)]
*  Okay, that's a little warm-up discourse [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1840.36s)]
*  All right next up we have Chapel Road not endorsing Kamala Harris forcefully enough [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1847.1599999999999s)]
*  This was a moment that combined several issues [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1852.56s)]
*  Israel and Gaza LG TVQ rights the youth vote and the importance of celebrity endorsements. Let's take a listen [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1855.72s)]
*  Here's Chapel Road actions speak louder than an endorsement [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1862.32s)]
*  Here's the full quote that a lot of people are just not reading [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1866.96s)]
*  I have so many issues with our government in every way [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1871.36s)]
*  She says there are so many things that I would want to change so I don't feel pressured to endorse someone [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1874.56s)]
*  There's problems on both sides and I encourage people to use your critical thinking skills use your vote vote small vote for what's going on in your city [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1879.6s)]
*  The change she wants to see in the US is this election year. She says instantly is trans rights [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1888.8799999999999s)]
*  They cannot have cis people making decisions for trans people period [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1895.6799999999998s)]

*  hearing from my mouth if you're still [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1902.7199999999998s)]
*  wondering [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1906.1599999999999s)]
*  No, i'm not voting for trump and yes [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1907.64s)]
*  I will always question those in power. I'm sorry that you fell for the clickbait [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1911.72s)]
*  That kicked off a shit storm for a week [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1918.6000000000001s)]
*  You know [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1923.72s)]
*  The whole thing was so everything about it was stupid everything about it was frustrating [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1928.1200000000001s)]
*  Uh, like I love chapel rhone [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1933.88s)]
*  I think tap alone like a lot of the people criticizing chapel rhone should go outside and touch grass [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1937.0s)]
*  and [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1942.84s)]
*  Like i'm being perfectly clear and then being like how dare you misinterpret my completely [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1944.1200000000001s)]
*  Uh elliptical and confusing way of talking about politics allow me to make myself perfectly clear [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1950.6s)]
*  I'm once again going to say something similar. That's very hard to interpret [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1956.04s)]
*  It was like for no one and it's like you're not a political expert [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1959.08s)]
*  You're putting yourself out there. You became incredibly famous in this year. That must be an insane amount of pressure [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1962.9199999999998s)]
*  Why are we why are we doing this? [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1968.04s)]
*  Well now that we can look back on the race, I think we would all [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1970.36s)]
*  Agree that celebrity endorsements were the the difference maker. That's true, too. Just depends on your celebrity [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1973.96s)]
*  Winners hulk holgen joe rogan [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1982.04s)]
*  I was just Taylor surfed Beyonce fully opted out of this discourse at the time [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1984.92s)]
*  I mentally muted the whole thing for a week [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1992.52s)]
*  well, I think I think like the the bigger thing to take from it's not like this one moment about chapel rhone but like [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1994.36s)]
*  You know like there was like a big chunk of people like [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=1999.08s)]
*  Like there are like the people that got behind trump were super excited and gung-ho about it [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2002.36s)]
*  A few people were like that about comma [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2006.2s)]
*  but there were a lot of people like chapel rhone that felt like it was [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2007.6399999999999s)]
*  Uncool or problematic to full-throatedly get behind a democrat and like I would like that to not be true in the future [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2010.2s)]
*  It'd be great if we were a place a movement where chapel rhone was excited and it was valuable for her to be a part [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2015.6399999999999s)]
*  Of it and for in both directions [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2020.68s)]
*  That'd be cool. That'd be nice [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2023.24s)]
*  Boy, would it boy would it? [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2025.56s)]
*  Yeah, what a discourse [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2027.6399999999999s)]
*  All right [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2030.12s)]
*  Next up we have the discourse should democrats be doing more to reach men [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2032.04s)]
*  Here's a tweet from our friend travis helwig who texted me before this [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2036.68s)]
*  He disavows his phrasing but stands by his point. Let's listen [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2040.68s)]
*  If comla loses which is very possible [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2045.72s)]
*  There needs to be a real discussion about how democrats speak to and reach young men [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2047.8s)]
*  There are very few straight men under 40 in the democratic consultant class [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2051.7200000000003s)]
*  So when ad try to reach young men, they come up as deeply and authentic [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2055.4s)]
*  Uh this spawn many responses accusing travis of needing to shut the fuck up and hating women [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2059.88s)]
*  Too many fags in the democratic party, huh travis [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2066.04s)]
*  Travis had just left out that one clause about the makeup of the consultant class [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2070.2799999999997s)]
*  He had a great point which is we didn't do great with young men this cycle [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2074.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean look I think [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2078.2799999999997s)]
*  I think when you look at democratic consultants [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2080.6s)]
*  Uh, most of them are like men over 40, right? [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2083.7999999999997s)]
*  Uh the the under 40 men are uh, they're usually operatives [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2087.64s)]
*  Staffers stuff like that, but I don't know i'm i'm 40 now. Look trevis didn't uh didn't work out artfully you were 40 [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2092.06s)]
*  Yeah, i'm in my 40s. I should have said that's what I meant. Um, but yeah clearly we did have a problem [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2099.02s)]
*  Uh getting men. Yeah, we have a huge problem [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2104.62s)]
*  I think it is I like I think putting it pointing at consultants is whatever but like it's a collective [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2107.5s)]
*  Inability to sound like normal people a bunch of podcasts where it's like hey you come over here [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2113.2400000000002s)]
*  You can say whatever you want. We don't care. I don't love that [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2117.5s)]
*  But on our side is like you better be careful. There are trip wires and you're gonna hit them [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2120.22s)]
*  I will say that the gender gap at least according to the exit polls ended up being not as large as the [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2125.82s)]
*  Poll suggested and that's because we did worse with women john. That's right. That's right [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2131.82s)]
*  That's what I was getting at dan [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2137.9s)]
*  We were we did worse with women [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2141.5s)]
*  Uh, so guess we had a women problem as well [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2143.58s)]
*  Yeah, we had we look we have we're having a problem a human problem we need more human like we're having a [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2146.38s)]
*  difficulty reaching yeah voters human beings, but I will say even an even among [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2151.02s)]
*  Gen z where we also had a big problem. The split was the biggest split was college educated [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2156.54s)]
*  non-college educated, uh, not men women, right so it's uh [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2162.46s)]
*  And we'll see more when the data comes out [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2166.54s)]
*  But yeah, we have a problem with people who don't have college degrees and a problem with travis and we have a big problem with travis [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2167.9s)]
*  Um, who does hate what travis? Yeah. Yeah, for sure for sure. I'll appreciate you saying that uh, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2173.66s)]
*  Here's our last discourse in a stacked category. You knew this one was coming again [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2181.02s)]
*  Should biden drop out? [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2186.14s)]
*  You guys were subtweeted by the campaign after seconds to drop out being referenced in a fundraising email as self-important podcasters [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2188.86s)]
*  Uh, anyone who called for buying to cop to drop out was called traitors by several parts of the internet [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2196.54s)]
*  Uh, we read a lot of those kinds of takes in our blue and non-section. What do you guys think? [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2202.86s)]
*  I don't I don't have a clip. This is such a setup think about what [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2210.38s)]
*  Here i'll i'll i'll here's what i've just been i've been thinking about just as we watch [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2214.94s)]
*  the final few weeks of the biden administration [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2219.82s)]
*  And it becomes clear in just these past few weeks how ridiculous the assertion was that he was in shape [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2223.26s)]
*  Uh to be president over the next four years that my regret [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2230.2200000000003s)]
*  Is that it took until not just seeing him once behind the scenes when we went to the white house [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2233.9s)]
*  Not just seeing him a second time when we saw him at that fundraiser [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2238.38s)]
*  But till the debate to be full-throatedly honest because I feel like we this I wasn't there [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2240.94s)]
*  I said didn't I say I said I was in we saw yeah. Well, some of us were there. I sorry [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2246.86s)]
*  He was at the cluny fundraiser. Yeah [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2252.54s)]
*  You're part of it. You're fucking part of it. You'll be on the lawsuit the uh [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2255.6600000000003s)]
*  like your collective tone, but uh, uh, like I I think like [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2259.82s)]
*  Because he wasn't dropping out and it seemed like a fait accompli [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2264.06s)]
*  It was hard like we were very hard on on biden and wanting him to get out there to dispel [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2267.02s)]
*  Questions about his age but looking on it back like it's could we have gotten there faster? [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2272.06s)]
*  Could we push harder? I don't know but I come away from that moment being like [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2276.2200000000003s)]
*  Uh, like thinking more about how we got to that place in the first place [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2279.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, like joe biden shouldn't run again the the hard part about this was [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2282.6200000000003s)]
*  What people don't remember is in the 2020 primary there was also a conversation about joe biden's age [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2286.7s)]
*  I think we all were on the side that he was probably too old to be running then said as much on the show [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2291.3399999999997s)]
*  He won the primary that made them very angry. They didn't speak to us for four years [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2296.06s)]
*  And so in the midterms happened, I think joe biden took the wrong message from in 2022 that democratic success in a midterm went a bunch of [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2300.8599999999997s)]
*  completely [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2307.96s)]
*  Uh outside the mainstream crazy republicans ran for senate seats and lost like dr [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2308.94s)]
*  Oz that it meant that the white house was strong that he should run for your election and that was some sort of [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2313.42s)]
*  Indication of his political strength. Obviously it was not but I felt like from our my position [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2319.1800000000003s)]
*  Like I was wrong in 2020. Who am I going to tell the incumbent president not to run for president? [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2326.06s)]
*  In that moment outside some sort of like [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2333.02s)]
*  Major event or indication like I think we talked. Why did we get one of those? [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2335.66s)]
*  We talked a thousand times about the polling about his age concerns about it [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2338.86s)]
*  We would constantly ask the question [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2342.7000000000003s)]
*  How do you fix this and I think almost every one of those conversations started with I don't know that it is fixable [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2344.46s)]
*  But if it is here are the things I would try to do [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2350.54s)]
*  They didn't really try to do any of those things because obviously there's been all this reporting now that [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2353.34s)]
*  um, you know keeping a full schedule was challenging for the president etc, etc [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2357.58s)]
*  So we don't have to belabor all of this, but that's kind of the backstory that people don't remember [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2362.7000000000003s)]
*  I just think it's worth remembering that at the time after the debate joe biden was behind the whole time [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2367.2599999999998s)]
*  He was behind to trump basically from the summer of 2023 [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2373.1s)]
*  Onward by the time the debate was over joe biden had [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2377.74s)]
*  A three percent chance of winning the election [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2381.8999999999996s)]
*  And the idea here was we could not go into election with a dangerous authoritarian who had a 97 chance of winning [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2384.54s)]
*  So we had to look for another option and that option was comble harris [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2389.74s)]
*  Who probably went into it with a 45 chance of winning and she was not able to get that last five percent, but [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2392.7s)]
*  The I like there's two questions. There is the could joe biden have served four more years [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2398.3799999999997s)]
*  I think the indication is pretty clearly no and is could joe biden have won the election and the by the time the debate [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2403.18s)]
*  Was over was obviously [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2408.9399999999996s)]
*  Highly unlikely that he would do so and there is one last moment to try to make a change to give us a chance to win [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2410.7799999999997s)]
*  He in the end weeks later than we had hoped but did step aside [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2416.7799999999997s)]
*  Kamala harris ran a very good campaign not a perfect one, but gave her a shot to win an election and in a very very tough [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2421.1800000000003s)]
*  environment and that's sort of where we that's where we were and [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2428.84s)]
*  And I will say to all not the blue and non people from the discourse section [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2432.54s)]
*  But most people like there was a could be a good faith disagreement on [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2435.58s)]
*  joe biden's electoral chances [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2439.6600000000003s)]
*  Or kamala harris electoral chances, but in the end most people [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2442.1400000000003s)]
*  Came together to try to get her elected and worked pretty hard at it [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2445.34s)]
*  I just want to say one more thing here like [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2449.5s)]
*  joe biden this decision was joe biden's and like a very small circle of people around him and mostly family mostly family and [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2452.3s)]
*  You know wall street journal was out today with like he [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2459.98s)]
*  Was more cloistered in this these four years than he ever has been in his whole career [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2463.34s)]
*  He had a small circle of advisors not a lot of other people got in [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2468.14s)]
*  And I remember when we did a crooked off-site like a year more than a year before the election [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2471.98s)]
*  and we did like a [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2477.9799999999996s)]
*  Political section where everyone could ask us questions about the coming race and politics and all you guys our staff [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2479.58s)]
*  Like peppered us with questions like why is joe biden running joe biden's tool? [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2484.9399999999996s)]
*  And I think then we said number one. No one is challenging him [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2488.7s)]
*  No one has decided to challenge him and number two like he is deciding with the people around him [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2493.18s)]
*  That he wants to run for president and he gets to decide and people think it's like the party this that the other thing [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2498.8599999999997s)]
*  Like he was he wasn't even listening to members of congress by the end [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2504.62s)]
*  At the end like chuck schumer barely got to his house to try to convince him. He was like [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2508.38s)]
*  You know, he wasn't listening to many people. So right right, right, but he did but the pressure did tom [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2513.5s)]
*  The pressure came but yeah, it was too late. It was pretty close to pretty close to him not doing it [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2519.18s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. So should joe biden drop out where his discourse of the year. No, I don't think so [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2523.1s)]
*  No, I don't think so actually some of the best [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2528.22s)]
*  Some of them best and most of them were the best discord we've ever had [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2530.7799999999997s)]
*  Okay, so chapel roner travis or the debate commission debate commission [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2534.62s)]
*  Debate commission we choose debate commission. Sometimes an ugly shitty little pug makes it to best in show and that thing never wins [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2542.2999999999997s)]
*  Okay, uh debate we're really doing debate commission as the worst discourse of the year. All right, that's works for me [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2548.54s)]
*  There's this does it sound like it works for you. I didn't even know it was discourse really. Yeah [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2554.54s)]
*  Yeah [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2558.7799999999997s)]
*  I don't I was on paternity leave and I was like I can't believe how many pods were talking about the debate commission [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2559.58s)]
*  Oh, did we we thought there was a lot of reminding people that they tried to kill joe biden by not making trump get a [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2564.46s)]
*  COVID test [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2569.9s)]
*  All right, the debate commission worst discourse of the year. Love it. All right [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2573.8199999999997s)]
*  I don't want to give travis that yeah [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2578.46s)]
*  Not chapel ron. Okay, uh the most bizarre right wing take of the year [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2581.1s)]
*  It was a banner year for right wing takes and I for one [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2586.94s)]
*  Thank our glistening waxy gray overlord elon musk for all the accurate right wing takes headed our way in 2025 [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2589.66s)]
*  However, the right had their swings and misses too [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2596.06s)]
*  Hey, they can't all be tom hanks died the first week of covet and was immediately replaced by evil tom hanks [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2598.86s)]
*  I forgot about that [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2607.18s)]
*  Let's take a look first up. We have something from fabs's close [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2608.78s)]
*  Personal friend jesse waters about commenting on birthdays the oldest president in history just got a little older [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2612.92s)]
*  It's joe biden's birthday the big 82 for the big guy and prime time would wish him a happy birthday [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2619.5s)]
*  But we have rules here men don't wish men happy birthdays [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2625.9s)]
*  What a wow [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2632.7s)]
*  He's he's always tongue-in-cheek about those kinds of things [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2634.14s)]
*  But it is just a reminder that masculinity is a prison that locks from the inside [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2636.46s)]
*  Oh jade is it gay to have a birthday fellas? [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2641.98s)]
*  Gay to wear pink fellas can someone note when jesse waters birthday is so we can all wish him a happy birthday [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2645.2599999999998s)]

*  It's funny bet. That's good [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2653.8199999999997s)]
*  Just you know, I feel like he like love it said I think he needs it july 9th [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2656.38s)]

*  From his bros. Yeah, you know from his bros close personal friends are on fabro. All right [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2663.1s)]
*  Next we have a right wing meltdown for taylor swift dating travis kelsey [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2669.02s)]
*  There were plenty of worthy clips here, but this from oan host alison steinberg takes the cake. Let's take a listen [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2672.94s)]
*  Well, yeah soros might own her music, but the devil surely owns her soul [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2680.46s)]
*  She suddenly became political and now she's plastered all over magazines airports the nfl and now even the super bowl [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2684.78s)]
*  It's just 24 7 [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2692.3s)]
*  nauseating coverage [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2694.6s)]
*  And we're supposed to pretend we don't see the psyop if taylor swift is really owned by soros [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2696.06s)]
*  We might actually have a rare chance to unite against him using taylor swift as the trojan horse [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2701.2599999999998s)]
*  Instead of pushing the alphabet mafia and murdering of babies to her fans [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2707.2599999999998s)]
*  She should be warning about the dangers of the corrupt elites. I mean that's something we could all come together on right? [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2711.9s)]
*  But of course that'll never happen with this guy pulling the strings now will it? [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2717.3399999999997s)]
*  Wow, wow, what an onion [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2721.9s)]
*  I was waiting for what is the trojan horse metaphor there? [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2724.7799999999997s)]
*  I think it's that [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2729.42s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's that george soros via his vehicle of taylor swift is going to push a pro gay [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2730.94s)]
*  Pro trans pro abortion agenda at the super bowl at the super bowl. She stuck the landing on that one [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2738.86s)]
*  What's the alphabet mafia? That's gay people. That's lgbtq [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2745.18s)]
*  Okay, that's that helps a little bit. Yeah, we're the alphabet mafia [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2749.18s)]
*  Wow, that's a that was that's that's up there for me. It's it's a contender [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2752.62s)]
*  Yeah, the only problem with it is it it's [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2756.7799999999997s)]
*  It's got to be some percentage performance art, right? They know what they're doing [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2759.66s)]
*  You know, they're like this is so crazy and ridiculous. It's going to get me clicks [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2763.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2767.5s)]
*  For sure for sure, but I don't think she also was sort of incomprehensible. Oh, absolutely [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=2768.62s)]

*  And the reality of an election that is likely to be this close [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=3493.2799999999997s)]

*  If you look back on the year where you take away from all of these like very reasonable like [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=3518.64s)]

*  Part of this is that I can't uh, feel good that I can't um, I can't stop it [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=4279.84s)]

*  No, I it's a joke. It's a joke guys, but what I am I am going to well [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=4288.64s)]
*  Like i'm going to the reason i'm going to post more is because i'm going to i'm going to put out my thoughts, right? [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=4293.92s)]
*  I'm not going to get in twitter fights stuff like that [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=4298.320000000001s)]
*  But I want to write my thoughts down more and if it's in posts, that's great if it's in articles, that's great [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=4299.92s)]
*  But i'm gonna I realize that just talking is is uh, not good enough for me [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=4303.84s)]
*  I want to actually write my thoughts down [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=4308.56s)]

*  Okay, I think it's good to write things down. I think sometimes [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=4321.68s)]
*  Writing things down is to you figure out what you really think when you actually try to write it down [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=4324.8s)]
*  That's right. Yeah, and and like some of it is there's times where i've just been like writing [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF7zrZZ2gU&t=4328.240000000001s)]
