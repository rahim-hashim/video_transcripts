Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Kamala Harris' Lead Polling Expert Explains Trump, the Polls, and How She Wins
**Pod Save America:** [October 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc)
*  Welcome to another special episode of Pod Save America. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Dan Pfeiffer. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2.6s)]
*  This is the third of four bonus pods I'll be hosting on Sundays in the lead up to the [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3.6s)]
*  election. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=7.68s)]
*  In today's episode, I'll be talking to Harris campaign pollster David Binder about the last [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=8.68s)]
*  week of the campaign, who the undecided voters are, and what the best arguments are to make [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=12.8s)]
*  to them in these final days. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=17.52s)]
*  Then later I'll be joined by senior editor of the Atlantic and senior CNN political analyst [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=19.32s)]
*  Ron Brownstein to talk about how the demographic shifts since 2020 are impacting the election. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=23.32s)]
*  But first, here's my conversation with David Binder. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=28.36s)]
*  David Binder, welcome to Pod Save America. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=31.04s)]
*  How are you, man? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=32.8s)]
*  Hello, Mr. Pfeiffer. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=33.8s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=34.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=35.8s)]
*  You we are recording this about 10 days from the election. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=36.8s)]
*  You were at the dentist this morning. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=38.84s)]
*  I promise you this will be not be the most painful thing you do all day. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=40.72s)]
*  I'm on one side if I sound slurred. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=43.44s)]
*  It's not because I had a bloody Mary before the show. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=46.08s)]
*  We do. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=49.68s)]
*  Our guests are often better when they have a drink before the show, but maybe a little [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=50.68s)]
*  localized anesthesia will have the same effect. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=54.32s)]
*  OK, here's where we are. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  We are 10 days out and we and everyone wants to know from someone who would know better [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=58.4s)]
*  than anyone else. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=64.08s)]
*  Where do you see the race standing right now? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=65.08s)]
*  I see the race as a toss up. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=67.68s)]
*  I and you know, Dan, it's been a toss up for almost as long as the vice president has been [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=69.92s)]
*  the nominee. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=77.36s)]
*  There have been slight changes here and there up and down, as you know, from your review [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=79.36s)]
*  But the story is pretty much the same today as it has been ever since the vice president [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=86.16s)]
*  became the nominee, which is we're a margin of error race. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=92.96s)]
*  The press has kind of decided for whatever reasons, maybe some of you see some of it [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  in the public polling, which I know you abhor and ignore, that Trump has some momentum here [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=102.32s)]
*  at the end. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=108.64s)]
*  What are you seeing in your polling? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=109.64s)]
*  Is it really been static? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=110.64s)]
*  You see momentum for him? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=111.64s)]
*  Do you see momentum for Vice President Harris? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=112.64s)]
*  We do not see momentum for Mr. Trump. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=115.44s)]
*  I think that the not totally sure where the momentum stories are coming from because in [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=120.0s)]
*  your right, there are public polls that we do pay attention to and some we don't. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=125.84s)]
*  But they're all pretty much saying that when you look at electoral college, you look at [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=130.32s)]
*  the seven states that are in play, the battleground states, all of them are still within the margin [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=134.96s)]
*  of error. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=140.8s)]
*  You might see a point moving toward Trump in some states, a point moving toward Harris [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=141.96s)]
*  in some states. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=145.96s)]
*  I don't see any sign of a late break at this point. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=148.08s)]
*  Late breaks do happen, as you know. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=151.52s)]
*  We've seen them in the past. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=153.4s)]
*  But we're not seeing any indications of that now, late break one way or the other. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=155.08s)]
*  The polling is really very consistent in the sense it's a couple points here, a couple [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=158.56s)]
*  points there, or a flat-footed tie in so many of these battleground states are going to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=163.52s)]
*  be the decisive factor. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=167.96s)]
*  I talked to Plouffe a few weeks ago and he estimated there are about 4% undecided and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=171.23999999999998s)]
*  maybe about 10% in total persuadable voters. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=177.04s)]
*  Who are those voters? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  What groups make up that or disproportionately make up that group of undecided voters? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=183.32s)]
*  Among the undecideds that we think will vote because there's also the question of the undecideds [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=188.35999999999999s)]
*  that don't vote, which we could talk about separately if you want. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=193.48s)]
*  Yes, yes, please do. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=196.64s)]
*  They tend to be independent voters of all ages. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=197.83999999999997s)]
*  We don't look at any particular age group as having a higher proportion of undecideds [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=204.27999999999997s)]
*  than others. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=209.2s)]
*  But that small amount of undecideds are essentially people that are conflicted and happy to talk [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=210.2s)]
*  more about what is behind that conflict. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=216.16s)]
*  But right now, they are pretty representative of the electorate as a whole. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=219.11999999999998s)]
*  We do find some more younger people undecided these days. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=226.04s)]
*  Young men is a group that is a little bit more undecided than we've seen in the past. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=229.76s)]
*  But usually the undecideds are pretty reflective of the electorate as a whole. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=236.24s)]
*  Let's talk about the conflict that some of these voters are having. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=242.44s)]
*  What is it that is keeping them back from making a decision one way or the other in [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=244.96s)]
*  this case? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=248.2s)]
*  The undecideds that we talk to are telling us that they have a fond memory of the economy [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=249.2s)]
*  under Donald Trump's presidency. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=257.32s)]
*  At the same time, they are saying they have very strong concerns about him as a person. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=260.47999999999996s)]
*  And they look at the vice president and they say, here is somebody new. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=268.0s)]
*  We aren't all that clear on what she did when she was vice president. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=273.28s)]
*  She talks about things that we care about. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=278.24s)]
*  We are not totally sure how she is going to do it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=281.20000000000005s)]
*  And we feel like there is a little bit of a risk in trying someone like her who we are [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=284.08000000000004s)]
*  not all that aware of. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=288.32000000000005s)]
*  Obviously, the run-ups after she was a nominee has been very short and many people say they [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=291.48s)]
*  didn't hear a lot about her when she was the sitting vice president. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=295.68s)]
*  So because of that, some of these people are saying, let's go back to the guy that we know [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=298.88s)]
*  has been there for four years and the economy was running strongly during that period. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=302.64000000000004s)]
*  So they are telling us it is a conflict that is a little bit about the economy, concerns [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=307.92s)]
*  about whether the vice president will be able to really make a difference in their lives, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=312.96000000000004s)]
*  but at the same time having very strong concerns about Donald Trump as a person and the divisiveness [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=318.08000000000004s)]
*  and the anger and hostility that he brings to the body politic. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=324.40000000000003s)]
*  I assume this is a balance, but it is sort of being portrayed in the press as sort of [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=329.96000000000004s)]
*  this choice the Harris campaign has. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=334.16s)]
*  Should you spend these last 10 days with your paid and earned media educating voters about [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=338.15999999999997s)]
*  who she is and what she would do, or should you spend your time warning people about the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=342.12s)]
*  kind of president Trump would be, whether that is his economic policies, the claims [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=348.47999999999996s)]
*  from John Kelly and others he is a fascist, Project 25, whatever it is? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=353.15999999999997s)]
*  How do you think about that messaging mix with these voters? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=356.5s)]
*  Is it different for individual voters or is there sort of a way to do it? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=358.64s)]
*  In our mind, or at least in my mind, it has to be both. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=363.72s)]
*  You cannot do one or the other. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=366.48s)]
*  There are really three, and we also have to talk about abortion and reproductive rights [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=367.72s)]
*  and not leave that off the table because that is something that is still incredibly important [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=373.08000000000004s)]
*  to so many voters across the country. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=376.96000000000004s)]
*  They are not buying Donald Trump's statement that I left it up to the states and everything [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=379.88000000000005s)]
*  is fine, they all wanted me to do it. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=383.40000000000003s)]
*  Voters are rejecting Trump's comment on abortion and they are fearful for what might happen [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=387.28000000000003s)]
*  if he wins on abortion. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=392.58s)]
*  But with regard to the two things you just mentioned, do voters need to hear more about [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=394.09999999999997s)]
*  Kamala Harris' positive policy prescriptions that are going to help the middle class bring [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=398.62s)]
*  down costs, make sure healthcare is affordable, prescription drugs, and we could just go down [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=404.26s)]
*  the line of the sorts of things that she is talking about. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=409.21999999999997s)]
*  They do need to hear that and they need to know that she is committed to fighting for [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=412.26s)]
*  those things every day. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=415.9s)]
*  At the same time, we cannot ignore the threat that Donald Trump poses as a potential leader [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=417.9s)]
*  of the free world for the next four years because of not only what John Kelly said, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=424.26s)]
*  but many other people who have worked closely with him that say that he is a threat and [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=428.97999999999996s)]
*  he will be a threat to the world order and the country's peace. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=433.41999999999996s)]
*  It's hard to say some voters need to hear the positive Harris, other voters need to [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=437.53999999999996s)]
*  hear the concerns and threat about Trump. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=441.62s)]
*  Both messages need to get out. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=444.02s)]
*  When you talk about, as the Vice President did in her press statement on Wednesday and [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=446.0s)]
*  then in the CNN town hall on Wednesday evening, about saying that Trump is a fascist, does [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=451.56s)]
*  that word mean anything to people or do you have to go a step further and explain what [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=456.96s)]
*  it is and how do you connect that threat to people's lives? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=460.96s)]
*  If it's sort of like he's a threat, he would do these things, but also price of eggs, how [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=463.96s)]
*  do you make it fit for people? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=469.48s)]
*  I don't think it's so much about a word because one word doesn't necessarily communicate [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=472.72s)]
*  in of itself what the threat is. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=479.0s)]
*  I think the things that John Kelly and we can go down the line with Mark Milley and [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=481.72s)]
*  everyone else are saying is that we cannot trust Donald Trump to have the country's [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=490.44s)]
*  best interests at heart because he's focused on himself, he may be focused on retribution [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=495.6s)]
*  and that their experience with him in the Oval Office, in the Situation Room, is he [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=501.24s)]
*  is one that doesn't follow the norms that are needed for the president of the country. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=507.28000000000003s)]
*  What voters need to know about him is that four more years of him could lead to greater [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=514.4s)]
*  chaos, it could lead to disorder, both domestic and international. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=520.84s)]
*  It's not just Kamala Harris and the liberals saying this, it's the people that worked [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=526.8s)]
*  with him, that were closest to him, who say that they are scared about and they don't [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=531.3199999999999s)]
*  trust him to be the leader of the country. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=537.3599999999999s)]
*  Those are the things that need to be communicated to the voters at the end here. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=539.68s)]
*  They have to understand that the people closest to Trump who worked with him in those very [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=544.3599999999999s)]
*  difficult periods in the Situation Room when Trump is dealing with international issues [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=550.08s)]
*  that are coming back and telling America now that what Donald Trump said during those circumstances [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=556.96s)]
*  were scary and we don't want to give him the keys to the car again. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=562.64s)]
*  You obviously are the focus group maestro, you've done more focus groups probably than [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=570.64s)]
*  anyone walking the planet over the longest course of your career. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=573.96s)]
*  Some things that I've seen, some focus groups I've seen when you do the dictator argument, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=577.6s)]
*  this is now before Kelly and Milley said it, publicly just Democrats asserting or using [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=580.84s)]
*  Trump's words that he is a dictator, is voters will say, well, he was president for four [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=584.16s)]
*  years and I didn't love all the things he did, but he wasn't a dictator, right? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=588.9200000000001s)]
*  Democracy didn't fall, the country is still standing. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=593.0600000000001s)]
*  What's the best response to that? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=595.6s)]
*  Yeah, no, we do hear that all the time, Dan. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=597.12s)]
*  People are saying that frequently, you really nailed it kind of where they are. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=599.32s)]
*  The best response to that is that the people who were around him that kept him in check [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=602.88s)]
*  during his first presidential term are now gone. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=610.36s)]
*  We sometimes say there are no guardrails is another phrase that we use to describe that. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=614.72s)]
*  It's true, we can talk about, there are several proof points for that. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=620.4s)]
*  Not only is John Kelly gone and is Rex Tillerson gone and is Mark Milley gone, but Trump has [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=625.96s)]
*  said that he wants to appoint people that are loyal to him, both as advisors, but also [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=632.2s)]
*  as cabinet members and also as the head of the Department of Justice. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=640.88s)]
*  So that when Trump says, I want to go after that guy, the DOJ will say, yes, sir. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=645.12s)]
*  And that anytime he says, if he says something about, I want troops to go clear the National [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=652.72s)]
*  Mall before I go out there, they go, yes, sir. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=657.6800000000001s)]
*  What we hear in our focus groups and we tell people that, Dan, is that people are saying, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=660.88s)]
*  we don't want the presidency to be surrounded by, the president to be surrounded by a bunch [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=666.0s)]
*  of yes men. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=671.0s)]
*  We need to hear a diversity of opinion. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=673.68s)]
*  The president needs to hear a diversity of opinion. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=677.6s)]
*  We know that when Donald Trump gets in office, it's my way or the highway. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=680.56s)]
*  So when Donald Trump has impulses, he will act on them and there won't be anyone there [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=685.2s)]
*  to say, sir, you're out of line. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=691.1600000000001s)]
*  Think twice about this. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=694.2s)]
*  What you're doing may be illegal. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=695.72s)]
*  Instead, they'll say, yes, sir, go do it. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=697.12s)]
*  We are recording this right before Donald Trump's going to sit down with Joe Rogan, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=700.96s)]
*  which is part of his very public, very aggressive, it seems, appeal to a certain set of gen Z [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=706.32s)]
*  men, particularly the particularly online ones, I think, are the ones he's targeting [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=713.36s)]
*  here. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=716.56s)]
*  Talk to me a little about the role that gen Z men play in your coalition and how you guys [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=717.56s)]
*  are trying to appeal to them and what issues they care about. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=721.72s)]
*  Yeah, you know, gen Z men are interesting in this case because, you know, the I believe [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=724.12s)]
*  the Trump campaign has frequently looked at younger men, gen Z men as someone that he [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=729.1999999999999s)]
*  can appeal to. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=735.56s)]
*  You know, sometimes I question whether you go to the Republican National Convention, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=737.36s)]
*  where you see Hulk Hogan ripping his shirt off or Kid Rock playing music. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=742.04s)]
*  And I'm not totally sure that that's the best way to to reach them. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=746.24s)]
*  But if you talk about if you talk to young men, their issues are not all that different [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=751.16s)]
*  than anybody else's. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=756.1999999999999s)]
*  They want to have the ability to have a good job with benefits and have a family and provide [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=757.28s)]
*  for family. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=762.8s)]
*  So they are focused on not only the day to day economy, but the future economy. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=764.8s)]
*  I think there's a lot of frustration. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=770.72s)]
*  We hear young men saying, you know, I want to be a home buyer, but the home housing costs [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=773.12s)]
*  are out of control. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=777.64s)]
*  You know, things like that that are frustrating them with the status quo. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=779.64s)]
*  And I think when you if you ask me, Dan, like, why is it that younger men seem to be not [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=783.84s)]
*  as strong right now in the polls for Harris as they may have been for Obama or for Biden? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=791.88s)]
*  One thing we would say is that we we have they have concerns about the last four years [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=799.8s)]
*  not giving them what they wanted economically, not giving them that economic security. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=806.3199999999999s)]
*  And there are a lot of reasons for that. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=811.24s)]
*  I think the aftermath of covid messed everything up economically. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=812.4s)]
*  But right now, when we're talking to young men, they are talking to us about about making [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=816.98s)]
*  sure they have a good job, making sure they have benefits, making sure they have salary, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=821.16s)]
*  making sure interest rates are low, making sure they can buy a home. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=824.96s)]
*  So they're like normal voters, right? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=828.12s)]
*  They're not this mystery, you know, sort of when you read the press accounts, it's like [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=829.6s)]
*  they care about crypto and gaming and cancel culture. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=832.4s)]
*  But it's that. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=835.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=836.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=837.12s)]
*  Or you hear stuff like, you know, there's been a war on white men, what young, what [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=838.12s)]
*  young guys feel like they're to blame for the world. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=840.4s)]
*  You know, we don't hear that. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=842.48s)]
*  I mean, I see it online sometimes, like, you know, there's a woke culture, a feminist movement [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=843.48s)]
*  that has made young men feel that they are outcast. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=848.52s)]
*  We never hear that. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=852.24s)]
*  You know, you and I obviously work together into Obama campaigns where change was the [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=853.24s)]
*  predominant issue. A lot of campaigns really are a battle between change for status quo. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=856.92s)]
*  This is a very confusing one because you have the sitting vice president to the incumbent [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=860.52s)]
*  president and then you have the former incumbent president. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=865.04s)]
*  So it's sort of is it change and status quo? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=867.0s)]
*  What is it? How important is it for Vice President Harris to represent some form of change [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=869.48s)]
*  from either the present or the last decade or from the you know, how are you guys thinking [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=875.76s)]
*  about that? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=879.4s)]
*  I think it's very important and I think the vice president thinks it's very important. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=880.4s)]
*  She's obviously said many times that she is not Joe Biden. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=885.1600000000001s)]
*  She won't be a continuation of Joe Biden. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=887.88s)]
*  And she does talk a little bit about the generational difference. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=889.8000000000001s)]
*  You know, Donald Trump is 78. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=893.48s)]
*  And when we know how old Joe Biden is and the vice president just turned 60, but she's [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=896.1600000000001s)]
*  of a different mindset, a different generation. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=900.6400000000001s)]
*  Her upbringing has given her a set of experiences that are very different. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=903.08s)]
*  So I think that it's important for her to tell the country, I am different. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=907.4000000000001s)]
*  I have a different approach and I'm going to be very committed to making sure that I [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=914.2s)]
*  can that I will improve the lives of middle class Americans today and for their children [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=919.72s)]
*  and their grandchildren. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=926.2800000000001s)]
*  She has she has stepchildren herself. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=927.2800000000001s)]
*  She will have grandchildren. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=930.84s)]
*  She is someone that is that is looking at the problems of the country from a little [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=932.84s)]
*  bit of a different lens than these guys who were born in the 1940s. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=936.96s)]
*  You brought up Trump's age and there's been a big effort from the campaign. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=941.1600000000001s)]
*  At least in some of their public remarks on social media talk about how Trump political [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=944.16s)]
*  report that Trump is exhausted. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=948.64s)]
*  He's canceling events. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=949.8s)]
*  Is there you know, I've seen polling in the New York Times poll today. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=950.96s)]
*  It's like 40 percent of people think Trump's too old. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=954.0s)]
*  What what role how what role does his age play in this at all? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=956.2s)]
*  Or some questions about his mental capacity? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=959.16s)]
*  You know, it's funny, Dan, when we were doing the groups of Biden and Trump before Biden [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=961.64s)]
*  stepped aside, they were focused on Biden's age and saying, you know, he were worried [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=968.92s)]
*  about his mental capacity and agility. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=975.16s)]
*  And will he go downhill in four years? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=977.4s)]
*  They weren't saying that much about Trump because Trump appeared a little bit more [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=979.64s)]
*  vigorous and Biden during that period. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=982.76s)]
*  But now we are hearing that more about Trump because of the contrast of Trump and Kamala [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=984.28s)]
*  Harris. And now there's no question about people saying that Kamala Harris is vigorous [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=988.52s)]
*  and energetic. And but they do start to say the same about Donald Trump. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=992.4s)]
*  And part of that is because more people are hearing what he's saying in the rallies. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=997.08s)]
*  He calls it a weave. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1002.24s)]
*  Other people call it rambling. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1004.24s)]
*  It has it has set into motion some questions. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1007.12s)]
*  Is he going to be mentally able in four years? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1012.0400000000001s)]
*  You know, because right now, he's going to be if he wins, he's going to be in office [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1015.76s)]
*  from 2025 to 2029 is when when a new president would be asked voters, what do you think [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1020.44s)]
*  about Donald Trump in 2029? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1026.12s)]
*  And they're like, you know, so it is age is an issue, both because of just, you know, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1028.04s)]
*  the actual number, the actual numeric age of him being in office until he's in his [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1038.1599999999999s)]
*  early 80s, but also because he's behaving a little weird in his rallies and the things [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1045.3999999999999s)]
*  he says. And when voters see that, they get more and more concerned. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1051.28s)]
*  You know, it's funny because his age, I said age is a number of something that bothers [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1055.48s)]
*  people, but it's really you have to tie that in with some concern that mental capacity [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1059.0s)]
*  isn't going to be as strong moving forward. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1063.92s)]
*  You want a president who is going to be nimble, who's going to be spontaneous, who will [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1067.56s)]
*  make the right decision in a in a crisis. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1070.84s)]
*  And if you have doubts about the about the person's mental capacity to be able to [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1074.64s)]
*  understand what's happening in a crisis, then you may decide to choose the younger [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1080.0s)]
*  person who you have more confidence in. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1085.68s)]
*  The you know, at the debate, Kamala Harris invited Americans to attend a Trump rally, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1088.04s)]
*  which is maybe a good way to as I joke, a good way to win votes and lose friends. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1092.96s)]
*  But and then at the recent rally, she's been showing video of Trump's events. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1097.12s)]
*  I take it that that's part of that argument. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1102.72s)]
*  You want people to see him because a lot of voters really because of the changes in the [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1104.76s)]
*  environment have not seen him like actually speak like live in maybe in years. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1107.92s)]
*  Right. Yeah, I think that that was strategic. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1113.1200000000001s)]
*  The debate was one of the first times that voters saw him [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1118.2s)]
*  spontaneous in. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1124.48s)]
*  You know, I'm talking about voters that are kind of, you know, people, people like us, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1126.0800000000002s)]
*  yes, people like you. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1130.24s)]
*  But, you know, but then he talked about, you know, people are eating the cats and eating [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1132.0s)]
*  the dogs and people got. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1135.72s)]
*  Oh, and now I think when we see that that wasn't just a one off, that's really the sort [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1137.04s)]
*  of person that Trump is. He says stuff like that. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1143.08s)]
*  So showing him speaking at rallies and saying crazy things. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1146.3600000000001s)]
*  And like last night, he said America's a garbage can. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1150.08s)]
*  You know, and I don't know how many people would have seen that particular phrase, but I [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1153.96s)]
*  doubt that the vast majority of American voters believe that America is a garbage can, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1157.96s)]
*  nor want a president to fix that. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1164.44s)]
*  That's one example of the sorts of things that people of the vast majority of voters [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1167.56s)]
*  may not be seeing or hearing. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1172.8400000000001s)]
*  That is a reason why the Harris White, why the vice president is trying to show that [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1175.0s)]
*  a little bit more frequently. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1181.56s)]
*  Like one of the defining characteristics of this campaign, dating all the way back to [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1182.76s)]
*  twenty twenty three when Trump was running, has been a media environment where casual [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1186.56s)]
*  voters, right, even some of them, even maybe in some cases, the majority or priority of [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1192.84s)]
*  voters are just not consuming political news in the way they used to. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1196.8s)]
*  Right. They're not seeking. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1199.76s)]
*  Is that they're not seeking out. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1200.64s)]
*  And it doesn't get to them sort of organically anymore because of changes in social media. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1202.16s)]
*  And so, you know, there was the folks at Blueprint did a poll a few months ago. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1206.56s)]
*  It's just like how many people heard anything about like the Biden debate. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1210.28s)]
*  And it's like 25 percent of people heard nothing about it. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1215.0s)]
*  Thirty percent of people heard nothing about either of the convention speeches. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1216.8s)]
*  Are you seeing your persuadable voter universe, your undecided voters tune in more in recent [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1219.32s)]
*  weeks or people now kind of dialing into this race here in the final weeks or they are people [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1223.8799999999999s)]
*  still a little removed? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1228.04s)]
*  Well, they're not doing it of their own volition. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1229.12s)]
*  What they're telling us you guys are spending a billion dollars to show it to them. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1232.6799999999998s)]
*  They feel they're being inundated with election information. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1238.52s)]
*  But a lot of it's coming from TikTok or Instagram from their social media sources. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1241.8s)]
*  They are not seeking it out. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1248.24s)]
*  I mean, we've talked to especially younger voters, but we talked to our full range of [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1249.68s)]
*  voters about where they're consuming their political information. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1253.5600000000002s)]
*  And it runs a whole gamut. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1257.0800000000002s)]
*  There's still people that watch the local news at six o'clock. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1258.4s)]
*  There are people that say, I'll watch CNN and then I'll go to Fox and I'll go to MSNBC [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1262.3600000000001s)]
*  and see how they're treating the same story. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1266.3600000000001s)]
*  But there are other people who are saying like, I've had enough of this already. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1269.0s)]
*  Like, I just want to be over. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1271.6000000000001s)]
*  And those people are primarily they're not seeking out anything, but it's coming to [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1273.5600000000002s)]
*  them through the various channels and social media channels. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1277.72s)]
*  And that's a little bit of a problem because the information they're getting is [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1281.08s)]
*  invented, obviously. A lot of them know it. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1284.6000000000001s)]
*  They say, like, I don't know if it's fact checked. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1286.3600000000001s)]
*  I don't know what's true anymore. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1288.24s)]
*  But for some voters, it's like, you know, such a difficult situation to [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1290.2s)]
*  or a difficult time to consume political news and not know if it's AI, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1295.2s)]
*  if it's a deep fake, if it's PSYOPs, you know, this is stuff we hear all the time. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1302.24s)]
*  And for some people, they just kind of give up. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1307.68s)]
*  And that's why I go back to the question you asked before about, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1310.16s)]
*  are the undecideds going to vote? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1313.76s)]
*  You know, who are the undecideds? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1316.8000000000002s)]
*  And then I pointed out some of them may not may not vote at all. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1318.2800000000002s)]
*  Talk a little bit about that, please. Yeah. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1321.44s)]
*  Well, no, it's interesting because, you know, it used to be, Dan, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1323.0800000000002s)]
*  when we and I started our youth, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1327.16s)]
*  that we had a rule of thumb that the greater the turnout, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1330.5200000000002s)]
*  the more the better it was for Democrats and liberals, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1334.72s)]
*  because young people tended to be a little bit more left leaning. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1337.6000000000001s)]
*  They were the ones that were more that were a little bit iffier on voting regularly, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1341.24s)]
*  while older people who tended to be a little bit more conservative would be, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1346.6000000000001s)]
*  I'll vote hell or high water. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1350.96s)]
*  That has changed now. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1353.2s)]
*  It's no longer the sense that a high turnout necessarily means good for the for the liberals, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1354.44s)]
*  because now with Trump, he brought out a group of new voters back in 2016. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1358.92s)]
*  That normally would not have voted. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1364.8400000000001s)]
*  And the question we're facing now in 2024 is, are the people that, you know, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1367.16s)]
*  the Trumps focusing on kind of, you know, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1373.24s)]
*  the maybe young men that have not voted before, will they get off the couch and vote for him? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1376.24s)]
*  Similarly, will some of the people that are normally, you know, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1381.1200000000001s)]
*  constituencies of the Democrats come out and vote? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1384.64s)]
*  So, you know, it may be that in this election, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1387.92s)]
*  a higher turnout does not necessarily mean good things for the Democrats. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1390.9199999999998s)]
*  And it may be that some of the some of the people who are leaning Trump [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1394.72s)]
*  end up staying home themselves. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1399.6399999999999s)]
*  That's why it's that's why it's such a question mark right now. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1401.96s)]
*  The whole game comes out to turnout in the turnout skew could go either direction. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1405.2s)]
*  Yeah, it seems I think it feels like a lot of people, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1412.0s)]
*  not you guys who have the actual data, but the people who sort of analyze the election [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1414.8s)]
*  or maybe on the periphery of the efforts to elect Harris or or defeat Trump, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1418.72s)]
*  really just say this is like 2020, it's like 2020, it's going to be just like 2020. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1423.72s)]
*  And whether she gets can she get Biden's numbers with Latinos to in order to get [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1427.44s)]
*  if she falls by one point where she can get that other point because it's so close. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1432.4s)]
*  But it seems very possible this election could end up looking very different than 2020. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1435.64s)]
*  Right. It's just in terms of turnout and composition. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1438.72s)]
*  Are you guys sort of how are you guys thinking about that? [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1440.92s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's it's it's clear. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1443.3600000000001s)]
*  I mean, there are some some polls would indicate that the [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1445.48s)]
*  proportion of younger black and Latino men may not be this. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1450.3600000000001s)]
*  Harris may not reach the benchmarks that Biden got with them, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1457.44s)]
*  but there are also indications that Harris is doing better with Republican [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1460.4s)]
*  with some some cohort of Republicans. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1463.8400000000001s)]
*  I mean, she talks and she campaigns with Liz Cheney and and has a significant [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1465.96s)]
*  Republican support. So the question mark, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1472.0s)]
*  well, it would be like a little five percent, seven percent, nine percent, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1473.76s)]
*  ten percent of Republicans that cross over and vote for Harris that would [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1476.72s)]
*  mitigate the what what small losses she could get with some of the younger [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1480.36s)]
*  younger men, both white men and men of Latino men. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1485.8s)]
*  I think are I think the the concern about black voters not being as strong for her, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1488.8799999999999s)]
*  I think, is not is a bit misguided. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1494.4s)]
*  I expect her to to meet those thresholds with black voters. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1496.72s)]
*  But that is the the question now is, are there different dynamics of play with [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1501.64s)]
*  Harris as the candidate that would cause her maybe to not gain as much [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1506.68s)]
*  or to slip a little bit with a Latino vote, but make up with it a little bit [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1513.3600000000001s)]
*  in among Republican women, especially younger Republican women. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1516.96s)]
*  I take it that like Liz Cheney is a good surrogate for those people. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1520.8000000000002s)]
*  Who are the other some of good surrogates that are helpful in persuading [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1523.92s)]
*  some of these undecided voters to get off the calcium vote? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1526.92s)]
*  Taylor Swift, Bruce Springsteen, a couple of surrogates. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1529.76s)]
*  I think on that on the stump, the former Trump staff that have now come out for her. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1534.3600000000001s)]
*  So Liz Cheney, obviously, was a congresswoman from Wyoming. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1541.6000000000001s)]
*  We have people like Olivia Troy, people that that were within [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1546.04s)]
*  the White House administration that were working for Trump, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1550.0800000000002s)]
*  wanted his administration to succeed, who watched it now say, I'm [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1553.6000000000001s)]
*  endorsing Kamala Harris and I hope you will, too. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1557.88s)]
*  So those sorts of people are important. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1560.3600000000001s)]
*  I think you can even go back to Adam Kinsaker, who's still a very good surrogate himself. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1564.48s)]
*  OK, Kamala Harris is going to give her closing argument speech on Tuesday. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1569.3600000000001s)]
*  She's going to do it from the ellipse, the site of Donald Trump's infamous [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1573.8400000000001s)]
*  speech before the crowd marched to the Capitol. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1577.2800000000002s)]
*  What is the one thing that you want undecided voters to have in their head [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1580.44s)]
*  when they walk in the voting booth, sit down the kitchen table with their ballot? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1586.4s)]
*  Like, what's the is there a moment of vision, an issue you want them thinking about? [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1589.3600000000001s)]
*  Because that's really what the battle of the last days of the campaign is. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1593.28s)]
*  Like, what's the last thing people are thinking about? [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1595.2s)]
*  I want them to be knowing that with Kamala Harris as vice president, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1597.4s)]
*  she'll wake up every day thinking about them, thinking about how to improve their lives, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1602.3200000000002s)]
*  what she can do to help Americans of all parties, all ages, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1607.72s)]
*  all Americans have a better life. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1613.92s)]
*  They need to know that she will be focused on that every single day. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1616.3600000000001s)]
*  And then there are corollaries. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1620.0400000000002s)]
*  And we could talk about what that means with regard to bringing prices down or helping [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1621.4s)]
*  with child care and making sure that Medicare covers home care so that people so that older [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1626.16s)]
*  people can get care in their home and not have to go to a nursing home. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1632.44s)]
*  I mean, there's a list of things she's now talking about her to do list. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1634.7600000000002s)]
*  And but what voters need to know when they cast that ballot on election days, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1638.64s)]
*  Kamala Harris will be fighting for them. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1643.0s)]
*  Right. That's the core contrast. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1645.04s)]
*  Right. Commerces for them. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1646.3200000000002s)]
*  Trump's firm self. Is that right? [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1647.48s)]
*  That's right. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1649.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, David Binder, this is a great place to end it. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1650.6000000000001s)]

*  As we can tell in this election, the right wing media machine has never been more [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1686.36s)]
*  powerful. They have spread dangerous lies about Hurricane Helene, about the migrants [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1689.4399999999998s)]
*  in Springfield. They are cleaning up Trump's messes. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1693.36s)]
*  They are launching false and damaging attacks against Kamala Harris and other [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1696.32s)]
*  Democrats up and down the ballot. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1700.24s)]
*  John, John and Tommy started Corky Media as a way to fight back against that media [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1701.6000000000001s)]

*  And we have big plans for 2025, no matter who wins this election. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1708.72s)]

*  Ron Brownstein, welcome to Pod Save America. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1740.8s)]
*  Dan, good to be back with you. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1742.64s)]
*  We are recording this about 10 days from the election. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1744.32s)]
*  Where do you think things stand right now? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1747.2s)]
*  Well, I think, you know, pretty unequivocally, the polling shows that there has been [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1749.2s)]
*  some movement toward Trump in October, but more at least in the public polls among [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1752.48s)]
*  nonwhite than white voters. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1758.32s)]
*  And as a result, I feel like we've kind of wound our way back to where we started [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1761.32s)]
*  the year. You know, before Biden got out of the race, his erosion with both black [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1767.3999999999999s)]
*  and Latino voters meant that he was in a very difficult position across the Sunbelt [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1773.8799999999999s)]
*  battlegrounds. But the fact that his support was largely holding from what he won [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1778.6399999999999s)]
*  in 2020 meant that paradoxically, he was in a relatively better position in the states [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1784.84s)]
*  that were more white, less diverse and older in the Rust Belt. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1790.52s)]
*  Right. The three states that fell out of what I once called the Blue Wall, which [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1794.12s)]
*  we'll talk about in a bit. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1799.3999999999999s)]
*  Harris comes in the race and Harris regains a lot of the ground that Biden lost with [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1801.28s)]
*  black and Latino voters. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1807.4399999999998s)]
*  But I think it's pretty clear in the final weeks that she hasn't regained all of it [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1809.8s)]
*  and is not likely to regain all of it. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1814.44s)]
*  It's almost an impossible mission to regain all of it, given how many voters in those [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1816.3600000000001s)]
*  communities do live paycheck to paycheck, kind of at the economic margin and feel like [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1820.88s)]
*  they were better off under Trump. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1825.64s)]
*  I remember thinking, writing way back, that if every Latino voter who said they were [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1828.24s)]
*  better off under Trump voted for him, it would be really difficult for Democrats and [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1833.48s)]
*  states where there are a lot of those voters. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1838.0s)]
*  So Harris is, as I said, much more competitive than Biden in the Sun Belt swing [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1840.56s)]
*  states, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1847.9199999999998s)]
*  But it's not 100 percent clear that she can be competitive enough to actually tip any [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1851.28s)]
*  of them back in her direction, which means that her most plausible pathway, and it is [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1856.3999999999999s)]
*  still a plausible pathway to winning, is to sweep Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1862.36s)]
*  I mean, I kind of feel like we're ending up back in a place where we started the year, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1868.48s)]
*  where it is essentially her ability to knit together just enough, hold enough of the, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1875.0s)]
*  you know, the large urban centers that are heavily minority, Philadelphia, Detroit, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1882.48s)]
*  Milwaukee, hold down her losses in the mid-sized cities, the Erie's and Scranton's [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1887.2s)]
*  and Green Bay's and Racine's, you know, Saginaw, and then blow off the doors in the [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1892.92s)]
*  white collar, well-educated inner suburbs, Oakland, Chester, Montgomery, Delaware, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1901.48s)]
*  Bucks, Madison, which is Dane County, and then the Well Counties outside of Milwaukee. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1907.5600000000002s)]
*  I feel like her formula is very similar in all of these states. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1912.4s)]
*  The national polls do not, I think, at all suggest that that path is close to her. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1917.0s)]
*  But they do show movement toward Trump and a need for her to kind of reset and regain, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1923.88s)]
*  I think, some of the control of the dialogue in the final days. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1928.44s)]
*  But that's kind of where I view it. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1932.76s)]
*  I mean, you know, that she is like Biden, largely holding what Democrats won in 2020 [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1934.8400000000001s)]
*  among white voters, maybe down a little among non-college whites and up a little among college [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1940.8400000000001s)]
*  whites, but netting out to a very close place, clearly suffering some erosion among non-white [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1944.68s)]
*  voters. And that means that creates more problems for her in the Sun Belt than in the [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1949.48s)]
*  Rust Belt. Paradoxically, the Rust Belt states are better because they're less diverse. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1953.8s)]
*  Which is the opposite of what we would have thought through all the years that I was working [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1958.52s)]
*  in politics and you were writing about it. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1961.96s)]
*  How many times did I write that? [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1963.72s)]
*  I remember in 2012 writing the story, even before Trump, that Democrats had to break [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1966.1200000000001s)]
*  through in the Sun Belt because their eroding position among blue collar whites meant that [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1972.28s)]
*  they could not rely on the Rust Belt to the same extent that they used to. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1977.96s)]
*  I mean, I wrote that story multiple times, especially after 2016. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1981.8s)]
*  But, you know, I think if you're looking in fairness, I think it is very reasonable to [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1985.32s)]
*  conclude that the counter mobilization against Trump in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1990.44s)]
*  since 16 has been greater than the mobilization that he was able to execute. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1996.44s)]
*  I mean, if you look at what's happened in those states, Democrats won the governorship in 18 [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=1999.88s)]
*  and won it by more in 22. They now have five of the six Senate seats. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2003.48s)]
*  Trump won them by a combined 80,000 votes in 2016. Biden then won them by a combined [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2008.2s)]
*  260,000 votes in 2020. They flipped three state houses out of the six and have a shot at another [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2014.2s)]
*  one in Wisconsin. I mean, basically, you know, in those states, the magnitude of the backlash [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2021.24s)]
*  against Trumpism in the growing inner suburbs, and we can talk about the demographic changes [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2027.4s)]
*  in these states. But, you know, if you look at the four suburban counties outside of Philly, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2033.24s)]
*  Biden won them by 115,000 votes more than Clinton did. I mean, that is a big [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2038.2s)]
*  difference. And, you know, he did better than her in Dane County and he did better than her in [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2044.92s)]
*  Oakland County twice as well. I mean, he won Oakland County, which is the big white collar [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2048.6s)]
*  suburb outside of Detroit by twice as much as Clinton did in 2016 or even as much as Biden did [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2054.36s)]
*  in, excuse me, Obama did in 2012. So, you know, Trump has clearly, you know, energized a lot of [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2060.52s)]
*  non-habitual blue collar, non-urban voters in the states, but he has moved these white collar [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2068.6s)]
*  suburbs further toward the Democrats. And I would not be surprised if Harris wins most, if not all [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2075.8s)]
*  of them, by even more than Biden did. I mean, based on my reporting from being out in Oakland [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2084.12s)]
*  County last weekend. I mean, the issue is this pincer movement that she faces in these states. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2087.96s)]
*  On the one hand, you know, she is a woman of color who they have successfully painted as a cultural [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2093.7999999999997s)]
*  liberal with, you know, all these attacks on transgender issues and elsewhere. So it wouldn't [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2100.2s)]
*  be shocking to me that if Trump ran even better in the small town exurban rural parts of Michigan, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2105.96s)]
*  Pennsylvania, Wisconsin than he did in 2020. And we'll have to see how much, but it looks like there [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2112.68s)]
*  could be some cracking in those central cities of Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Detroit, maybe not as [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2118.2s)]
*  much as we're seeing in national polls, but probably something given, you know, the frustration [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2125.64s)]
*  about the economy, particularly among black men. And so where does that leave you? That leaves you [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2131.08s)]
*  that she probably has to run even better than Biden did in the white collar in her suburbs, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2135.08s)]
*  but that is totally within her reach to do. I mean, that is totally possible for her to do. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2141.24s)]
*  She probably has to do it, but she can do it. No guarantee, but it's there. There's still that path, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2146.12s)]
*  seems to me, very viable for her to win those states, which would take her exactly to 270. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2152.8399999999997s)]
*  I mean, it is interesting that Trump has changed the makeup of the parties, but what he has done is [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2157.88s)]
*  he has, for the Republicans, he has swapped high propensity people who vote in every single election, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2164.2s)]
*  midterm special elections for lower propensity voters who have not turned out, other than [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2170.7599999999998s)]
*  two times Trump. Totally, totally correct. Absolutely. And, and you know, look, we know [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2176.12s)]
*  from 2016 and 2020 that Trump's superpower politically is his ability to turn out low [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2180.92s)]
*  propensity, non-college white voters, right? He's done that very well twice. We don't know [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2186.8399999999997s)]
*  yet whether that's going to translate into the same ability to turn out low propensity, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2193.7999999999997s)]
*  non-college, non-white voters, because in polling consistently, his strength, I think this is less [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2198.92s)]
*  true in the Latino community, but certainly in the black community, his incremental gains from 2020 [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2205.0s)]
*  are primarily among low propensity voters, young men, right? Who, you know, who really don't vote. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2211.0s)]
*  By the way, you know, every demographic group you can think of turnout rates are higher for women [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2216.12s)]
*  than for men. Like, you know, we're talking about Latinos or black voters or young voters, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2221.8s)]
*  especially young voters, young voters, the turnout gap is wider along lines of gender [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2225.96s)]
*  than it is for older voters. So, you know, you know, obviously Democrats are nervous about what [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2231.64s)]
*  they are seeing in the national polls and they should be, I mean, you know, by historic standards, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2239.64s)]
*  if she wins by a point or two, traditionally, that would not be enough to overcome the fact [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2243.8799999999997s)]
*  that the swing states are generally slightly to the right of the country. But, you know, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2251.08s)]
*  that's a little scrambled this year because the swing states she has to win are 80 to 90% white, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2255.72s)]
*  you know, and her vote, like Biden's, is holding up more among white voters than among non-white [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2262.68s)]
*  voters. So, you know, I can see how Georgia and North Carolina can get more complicated if Trump [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2268.7599999999998s)]
*  really improves five, six, seven points among black men. But black men are 5% or less of the [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2275.48s)]
*  electorate in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. I mean, college white women are [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2280.92s)]
*  three to four times as much of the vote in those states as black men. So, you know, if we're talking [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2285.7200000000003s)]
*  about, you know, college white women were somewhere between 15 to 18% of the vote in each of them in [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2292.6s)]
*  2020. You know, if we're talking about, you know, trading a three or four point decline [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2300.12s)]
*  among black men in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin for a four or five point gain among [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2308.28s)]
*  college white women, that would, you know, that would be a survivable trade for her, I think. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2312.92s)]
*  Let's talk a little bit about the demographic changes in the states. Every, like, every idea, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2320.52s)]
*  I'm guilty of this all the time. We sort of developed this framework because for a year, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2326.28s)]
*  we were operating under a rematch of Trump versus Biden. So, it's like, what numbers did Biden have [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2330.92s)]
*  to hit in these states to meet his 2020 margins? And then we expand that out to the groups, right? [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2336.6s)]
*  So, you know, she's got to get to 60% Latino voters. She's got to win under 29 by 24 points, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2341.72s)]
*  because that's what Biden did or whatever it is. But what that analysis ignores is any sort of [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2348.52s)]
*  changes in the electorate since then. So, you did some reporting for CNN with some new data. Tell [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2353.64s)]
*  us what you found. Yeah. So, Bill Fry, the great demographer at Brookings ran all this stuff for me. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2358.7599999999998s)]
*  So, all credit to Bill. I just, you know, I'm just the messenger. Historically, going back to the 1970s, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2363.32s)]
*  we've had a very consistent evolution of the electorate over every four-year cycle. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2369.0800000000004s)]
*  As a almost clockwork, we're talking about non-college whites, whites without a college [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2374.44s)]
*  degree, the cornerstone of the modern Republican coalition have declined about two to three points [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2380.36s)]
*  every four years as a share of eligible voters. And people of color and college educated whites [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2385.88s)]
*  have made up the difference, right? And that has been the story, you know, if you go back to Ronald [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2394.44s)]
*  Reagan's first election in 1980, non-college whites were two-thirds of the voters, college whites were [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2401.1600000000003s)]
*  one-fifth of the voters, and people of color were only a little bit, about 12 or 13 percent [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2409.48s)]
*  of the voters, right? And you kind of, you know, you kind of, this is using census data. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2415.56s)]
*  You know, and you kind of fast forward to 2020. And again, there are different data sources about [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2423.8s)]
*  the electorate, but they all show the same general movement. If you use the census as kind of a common [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2431.2400000000002s)]
*  barometer, you know, we went from the non-college whites being two-thirds of the voters to a little [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2436.76s)]
*  under 40 percent, a little under two-fifths. They dropped from two-thirds to two-fifths. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2443.8s)]
*  The college whites went from roughly 20 percent to roughly 30 percent. And the people of color went [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2448.36s)]
*  from 12 or 13 percent also to roughly 30 percent. So Bill Fry looked at the very latest data [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2455.48s)]
*  from the census September of this year, so like brand new, and found that essentially these trends [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2463.88s)]
*  are continuing. That if you look at the eligible voter population, which is all we can do at this [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2470.52s)]
*  point, we don't know who the actual voters are going to be, the eligible voter population, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2475.08s)]
*  college, excuse me, non-college whites are down another two points since 2020. And the difference [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2480.28s)]
*  is made up by roughly equal one-point increases in the share of eligible voters that are college [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2488.6s)]
*  whites and people of color. Now, what's really important for the conversation that we're having [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2495.3199999999997s)]
*  is that this change, he found, was more severe in Michigan and Wisconsin than almost anywhere else. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2502.44s)]
*  So, I mean, he has in the data that he analyzed, the working-class whites who are the core of the [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2511.4s)]
*  Trump coalition are down three points, two points, a little over three points, three percentage points [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2517.7999999999997s)]
*  in Wisconsin and almost exactly three percentage points in Michigan. Very little increase in people [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2524.7599999999998s)]
*  of color. The gain is almost entirely, the offset is almost entirely college-educated white voters. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2530.2799999999997s)]
*  And then in Pennsylvania, the change isn't as big, but it's not immaterial either. The blue collar [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2536.7599999999998s)]
*  whites are down about a point and a half as a share of eligible voters since 2020. By the way, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2542.68s)]
*  he sent me some more data, which I haven't written up yet, but if you look at it, I mean, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2547.16s)]
*  the population trends in these states kind of follow this. I mean, in Pennsylvania, [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2550.04s)]
*  the two counties that are gaining the most population are in the Philly suburbs. Dane County, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2554.8399999999997s)]
*  which is Madison, is gaining the most population in Wisconsin. The suburbs of Grand Rapids are [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2559.7999999999997s)]
*  gaining the most population since 2020 in Michigan. Normally, these effects, changing the electorate [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2567.48s)]
*  by a point or two, the composition of the electorate doesn't matter that much from election to [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2576.04s)]
*  election because it gets swamped by any changes in preference. I mean, the size of the group can be, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2581.32s)]
*  the changes in the size of the group can be overwhelmed by changes in the margins among [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2587.88s)]
*  the group. But in a year that is this close and which these states were decided by 80,000 votes [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2592.44s)]
*  for Trump in 2016, 250,000 to 260,000 votes for Biden in 2020. This time, they'll probably be [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2600.2s)]
*  decided by somewhere in the middle. Even this small little thumb on the scale could matter. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2607.16s)]
*  And by the way, I think it also reflects the reality of Harris's strategy that is aimed so [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2614.52s)]
*  clearly at those white collar suburbs, including voters who previously had voted mostly Republican. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2620.04s)]
*  Yeah, let's talk about that because she has spent much of last week campaigning with [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2625.4s)]
*  Liz Cheney. She has ads up with featuring Trump administration employee, former advisors who are [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2631.8s)]
*  attacking Trump. She made a big deal about Trump's fascism comments. I assume you see all of that [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2638.6800000000003s)]
*  seems to be directly targeted at this group of voters. Yeah, totally. I mean, look, I mean, [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2645.48s)]
*  there's this first, by the way, the only thing, the other to button up the point, the blue collar [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2648.6000000000004s)]
*  white share of the vote is going down in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, as it is everywhere else, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2654.68s)]
*  but it is still higher than it is nationally, considerably higher. So, as a share of eligible [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2659.08s)]
*  voters, the blue collar whites are now down to about 50%, just over 50 in Michigan and Pennsylvania. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2666.44s)]
*  And they've fallen under 60 now in Wisconsin. And they will probably be slightly less a share [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2674.04s)]
*  of the actual vote than they are the eligible vote because college whites turn out higher, [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2682.52s)]
*  way higher than anybody else. Like their turnout rate is, you know, we're probably going to see [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2688.44s)]
*  90% of eligible college whites vote. So, you know, if you use the census data, like for example, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2693.24s)]
*  Michigan in 2020 was 51% blue collar whites, 29% college whites, 20% non-whites, you know, [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2702.44s)]
*  basically it'll probably be something like 49, 30, 21 this time. I mean, the actual tends to follow [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2710.92s)]
*  the, so, you know, you can't ignore working class whites in these states. You have to remain [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2718.92s)]
*  competitive among them. And certainly it is critical for Harris to do everything she can to [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2725.7200000000003s)]
*  gain a little with the working class white women to offset what will probably be at least some [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2733.4s)]
*  decline among the working class white men. And this is, I mean, I think this is one of the things [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2739.96s)]
*  we lose to in these kinds. It's not just that you're going to get some people in these suburbs who [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2744.52s)]
*  voted for Trump last time to vote for Harris this time. It's that more people live there now, right? [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2749.4s)]
*  You have people who have moved from the cities, people who have moved from the suburbs into these [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2753.96s)]
*  places. You have in-migration. Some of it's pandemic driven, right? People who don't have to [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2758.04s)]
*  commute to work anymore or people who maybe lived somewhere like we live in California who moved [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2763.0s)]
*  away because of remote work. Like there's more people in these places to help drive those numbers. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2767.64s)]
*  You know, look at a similar Waukesha outside of Milwaukee. Now, the suburbs of Milwaukee are [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2772.7599999999998s)]
*  still the most Republican leaning white collar suburbs north of the Mason-Dixon line, but they [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2780.52s)]
*  are moving too, right? Waukesha is the biggest one. The mayor of the town of Waukesha, the Republican [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2787.08s)]
*  mayor of the town of Waukesha, which is in the county of Waukesha, like Waukesha squared, he [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2792.68s)]
*  just endorsed Harris, right? And this is the kind of the movement that Democrats need. Hillary only [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2800.12s)]
*  won 33% of the vote in Waukesha. Biden won 39% of the vote. Evers kept it at 39% of the vote. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2805.96s)]
*  The state Supreme Court election, Democrats got up to 42% of the vote. This is the biggest block [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2816.12s)]
*  of votes for Republicans in the state of Wisconsin. So does Harris cross 40% in Waukesha? [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2822.52s)]
*  Can she get to 41, 42 like Janet Protasewicz did last time? Ozaukee, Washington, the other Wau counties [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2829.88s)]
*  are not as big, but it's generally the same story. You know, Biden did six points better in Ozaukee [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2838.36s)]
*  than Hillary did, and Evers did six or seven points better than Biden, excuse me, one point [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2844.7599999999998s)]
*  better than Biden did. Same kind of thing in Washington. So can you shave the margins down [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2851.96s)]
*  there, blow out the doors in Dane, avoid a collapse in Milwaukee? If you can do all of those things, [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2857.88s)]
*  there are not enough people everywhere else for Trump to overcome that. Now, the other thing that [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2865.32s)]
*  we should say is that, and I have to say, we've been talking almost entirely about these three [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2872.2s)]
*  states because it seems to me that there is a big fall off. Maybe Georgia is still within reach for [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2878.12s)]
*  her, but I think these three states are much more plausible than any of the Sun Belt states, with the [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2883.7999999999997s)]
*  possible exception of Georgia staying close. But the other thing that's characteristic about the [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2889.7999999999997s)]
*  Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin is that they do have a lot of mid-sized cities, like smaller [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2896.92s)]
*  cities, you know, the Erie, Scranton, Eau Claire, etc. These demographic changes, the way the [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2903.72s)]
*  coalitions have shifted, that explains Harris's strategy. It also sort of explains Trump's, [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2910.4399999999996s)]
*  because he's not trying to get those votes. He is not trying to increase his or lose by less among [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2914.12s)]
*  college-educated suburban voters, where he's trying to find voters to make up the gap for whatever [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2922.12s)]
*  gain she makes, is obviously jacking up turnout among his base. But he may, you know, who knows [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2927.48s)]
*  how close to the ceiling he is there, because that's not a population that's growing, as you [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2932.04s)]
*  point out, shrinking, is with voters of color and then low propensity younger male voters. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2935.0s)]
*  Right, right, absolutely. And look, I mean, you know, I don't know the exact number, but I'm [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2943.4s)]
*  guessing black men are triple the share of the electorate in Georgia that they are in Michigan [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2948.84s)]
*  or Pennsylvania, much less Wisconsin. I mean, Wisconsin, only, you know, less than 10 percent [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2954.2799999999997s)]
*  of the vote are people of color. So, you know, if Trump is successful in peeling off, you know, [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2959.16s)]
*  four or five points of black men, mostly on economic discontent, but also to some extent [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2965.0s)]
*  on these issues, or if he's successful at peeling off, you know, more, really, more like 10 points [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2970.2799999999997s)]
*  of Latino men, and there it is, both economics and culture. Well, you know, they are a big share of [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2976.8399999999997s)]
*  the vote in Arizona and Nevada, and the black men are a big share of the vote in Georgia, [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2983.3999999999996s)]
*  and that is a problem that is hard to overcome. You know, that's like a real hole in the hull [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2988.28s)]
*  of the ship. Whereas in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, it ain't great, but it's not nearly as [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=2996.84s)]
*  threatening given how small a share of the vote they are. And, you know, it doesn't seem likely [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3004.28s)]
*  there's going to be significant erosion among black women. I mean, that doesn't seem likely. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3009.2400000000002s)]
*  And, you know, I think it is possible that Harris will even match what Biden did among Latinas, [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3013.7999999999997s)]
*  maybe a little erosion there. But, you know, the erosion among the minority communities is [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3021.16s)]
*  preponderantly, I mean, maybe all among men. And again, that is a problem in the Sun Belt States. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3028.2s)]
*  Interestingly enough, I talked to David Binder before this, and he did, he acknowledged there [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3037.0s)]
*  would be some erosion, although he thought he did think it was quite possible that she would [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3041.8s)]
*  get to Biden's numbers among black voters overall. So maybe you're swapping out, [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3047.0s)]
*  so you're losing some black men, but you're getting some more black women. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3051.4s)]
*  Biden was already over 90 percent. Sorry, Biden was already over 90 percent among black women. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3053.96s)]
*  So, like, if they can match his totals among black voters overall, even if just in these three states. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3058.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and presumably he thinks they can run better among college whites in those [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3066.84s)]
*  states than Biden did, right? And that would allow you, that would allow you potentially to, [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3071.72s)]
*  and if you can avoid the non-college white women running for the exits, then you're really just [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3077.56s)]
*  talking about, can you survive decline among non-college white men, maybe closer back to [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3084.8399999999997s)]
*  Hillary levels? I don't think she could survive it going all the way back to Hillary levels, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3089.3199999999997s)]
*  but we're not seeing that in polling. I mean, we're not, we are not seeing a big change from 2020 [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3093.24s)]
*  among either non-college whites or college whites. I mean, a little better among college whites, [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3099.88s)]
*  probably a little worse among non-college whites, but nothing as big as what we are seeing among [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3105.2400000000002s)]
*  black and Latino men in polling. The changes are pretty small. Now, you know, it is offsetting to [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3109.8s)]
*  some extent, all right? I mean, you know, she's gaining among the college white women, she's [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3114.92s)]
*  losing among the non-college white men, but it doesn't feel, and it doesn't feel like it's a, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3118.1200000000003s)]
*  it's a, you know, a rupture or a fundamental fracture. And at least as we talk today, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3125.0s)]
*  the pollsters that I talked to in those states, including Republicans say, you know, we're not [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3133.48s)]
*  seeing like, it's not like there's a rolling ball down the hill among white voters. You know, [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3139.48s)]
*  it's not like it's, you know, it's not like the vote among the vote among white voters in these [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3144.68s)]
*  states might be a point better for Trump than it was two weeks ago. Right. That's sort of, that's [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3151.08s)]
*  sort of where we are. Last question. Is there anything you're going to be watching for over [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3155.08s)]
*  the next 10 days here to hopefully maybe give you a sense of how this is going to turn out? [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3158.84s)]
*  You know, as, as, as a pollster said to me today, it's, it's kind of vain to have too much confidence [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3164.44s)]
*  when we're talking about margins like this. Now, obviously there continues to be movement toward [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3171.0s)]
*  Trump. You know, you'd say, well, you know, historically, you know, elections, there's a [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3174.68s)]
*  little swell at the end and all the dominoes fall the same way. And that's a risk for Harris, but [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3180.04s)]
*  I'm not sure that's going to happen. I, I think the question is, what are we talking about at the [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3186.52s)]
*  end? You know, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm persuaded by the argument by Mike Pothoser, the former political [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3191.0s)]
*  director of the AFL-CIO who has used data from catalysts, whose folks you've probably had on [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3196.2799999999997s)]
*  here as well, to point out that there are 91 million separate human beings, not the separate [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3200.52s)]
*  individuals who have come out to vote against Trump or Trumpism in the election since 2016, [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3207.32s)]
*  which is considerably larger than the 83 million who've come out to vote for him [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3212.6s)]
*  or, or his, or Republican candidates. And, you know, the, the, the part of that coalition, [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3217.64s)]
*  what they call the anti-MAGA majority, what him and Simon Rosenberg both call the anti-MAGA majority, [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3223.56s)]
*  you know, are also irregular voters, low propensity voters. And the question is, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3228.68s)]
*  is the final stage of the campaign unfolding in a way that says to those voters that there's enough [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3233.0s)]
*  at risk that they have to come out? And that is what would allow her to survive any kind of [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3238.4399999999996s)]
*  mobilization on the, on the Trump side. I, like I said, I mean, I think at least in those three [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3245.72s)]
*  states, I can't say for sure in Georgia or Arizona, but there's certainly evidence even there, [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3251.48s)]
*  at least in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, the evidence is that the counter mobilization [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3256.12s)]
*  of Trump was bigger than his affirmative mobilization, but based on the results of [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3259.4s)]
*  the last eight years. And there are cracks in that counter mobilization, mostly because of inflation [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3263.4s)]
*  and frustration, you know, for people who are living paycheck to paycheck, but it is still [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3269.16s)]
*  available. That path is still open to her. So I guess I, I, for me, the question is, what's the [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3275.24s)]
*  question? Like, what's the question we're asking in the final days of the campaign? Is it, were you [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3280.68s)]
*  better off under Trump than Biden? Or is Harris too much of a continuation of the Biden presidency? [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3285.8s)]
*  Or is it whatever else you think about the economy or Biden's performance or what he did on the [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3292.92s)]
*  border, is Donald Trump a risk the country can't afford? And I don't think we know for sure which [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3298.36s)]
*  way that's going. Kelly kind of pushed it one way, but it would probably matter if other people who [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3304.36s)]
*  believe that like Mark Milley, you know, Jim Mattis came out and said, this is a risk we cannot take. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3311.24s)]
*  So yeah, I think we're just right on the knife's edge, but that the, like the Lord of the Rings, [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3319.72s)]
*  you know, what was it? The way is shut. Like the way is not shut. Like it's not, you know, [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3326.12s)]
*  they're going through the mountain. The way is not shut for her through the former blue wall [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3331.08s)]
*  states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin. Well, that's as good a place as there is to end it. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3335.7999999999997s)]
*  Robert Browse, thank you so much for joining us. Thanks for having me, Dan. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3340.12s)]
*  That'll wrap up today's episode. Thank you to David Binder and Ron Brownstein. I'll be [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIm5SplyGGc&t=3343.64s)]
