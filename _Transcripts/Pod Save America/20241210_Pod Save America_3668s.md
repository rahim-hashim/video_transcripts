Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Luigi Mangione, The UnitedHealthcare CEO Murder, and the Debate on American Healthcare
**Pod Save America:** [December 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0)
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Jon Favreau. I'm Jon Lovett. I'm Tom Evitor. On today's show [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump sits down for his first major interview since winning the election and lays out his plans on deportations, tariffs, health care, political retribution, and more. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=4.24s)]
*  The killing of United Health Care CEO Brian Thompson crosses the barrier from [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=12.08s)]
*  cultural fixation to political debate, though it's still a cultural fixation. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=16.6s)]
*  And in some incredible news, Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad flees to Moscow, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=20.96s)]
*  ending two generations of his family's sadistic rule. We'll get into what this means for the world and for America's new president. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=25.639999999999997s)]
*  But first, we've been following the shooting of United Health Care CEO Brian Thompson like everyone else, a story that now clearly has a political angle. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=33.44s)]
*  Well, because he's running for the 2028 primary. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=41.32s)]
*  Correct, yes. We don't know which party. As of this recording, Monday afternoon LA time, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=43.64s)]
*  police have a quote, strong person of interest in custody, 26 year old Luigi Mangione, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=48.8s)]
*  who was apprehended at a McDonald's in Pennsylvania with a backpack containing a gun, a silencer, fake IDs matching the ones used in New York, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=54.2s)]
*  and a handwritten manifesto that didn't give the health insurance industry the best reviews. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=61.52s)]
*  This was after the bullet casings found at the scene had the words delay, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=67.0s)]
*  deny, and depose written on them. The reactions on social media, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=70.92s)]
*  which is why this is one of the reasons why this is a big story, have ranged from people joking about the murder to celebrating it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=75.19999999999999s)]
*  United Health Group had to shut off the Facebook reactions to the announcement of Thompson's death after nearly 75,000 users responded with a laughing emoji. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=81.39999999999999s)]
*  The reaction inevitably reached the point where politicians got asked about it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=90.84s)]
*  Here's California Congressman Ro Khanna on ABC's This Week on Sunday. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  Let me just say it was horrific. I mean, this is a father we're talking about of two children and my sympathies to the entire family. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=99.32000000000001s)]
*  There is no justification for violence. But the outpouring afterwards has not surprised me. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=107.56s)]
*  Look, I, as a congressperson, had United Health Group deny a prescription for a nasal $100 pump spray, and I couldn't get them to reverse this. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=113.96000000000001s)]
*  So imagine what ordinary people are dealing with. The biggest denial comes when it's cancer treatment. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=124.0s)]
*  I mean, people are getting denied on cancer treatment. And my view is very simple. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=129.96s)]
*  Why can't we have a rule that if a doctor prescribes something and if Medicare, traditional Medicare, is going to cover it, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=133.6s)]
*  then private insurance companies should be forced to cover it? I mean, it's absurd in this country what's going on. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=139.96s)]
*  I think that's a good idea. What do you guys think of Ro's answer and what's your general take on this story? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=145.0s)]
*  So I like when I saw that the shooting had happened, I was just I was like, OK, so here's what's going to happen next. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  I just was waiting for it. Like there's going to be a round of people celebrating it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=157.76000000000002s)]
*  There's a round of people criticizing the people for celebrating it, then a round of people criticizing those people for not understanding the pain that people are experiencing in their lives. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=161.88s)]
*  Everybody's the universal health care. Right. Right. It's sort of like Medicare for all or else. Right. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=169.44s)]
*  Right. That's the worst idea I've heard. But the but the like the the kind of like performative, the way the way you demonstrate, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=174.92s)]
*  you really understand what's broken in our health care system is by performing this lack of empathy. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=184.64s)]
*  That's how you demonstrate you really get it. And if you don't have that lack of empathy, that means you don't really get it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=188.88s)]
*  All of that. I was just sort of like just sort of waiting for it, of course, like unfolded actually worse than I expected. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=193.27999999999997s)]
*  It was all pretty ugly. The thing that I like. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=199.88s)]
*  There was there was a lot of like earned vitriol, like insurance companies. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  Some are better than others. Plenty play games even break the law to try to avoid paying. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=209.72s)]
*  We have a cruel and broken system. Like that's what we have. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=214.96s)]
*  Like this guy, well compensated, is a tool of a broken system. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=218.56s)]
*  This insurance company exists and benefits from a broken system. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=222.68s)]
*  And like that to me, like I want to have a debate about the broken health care system and why we have this ridiculous system [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=226.16s)]
*  where half the people get insurance through work, which creates these incredibly convoluted and broken incentives, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=233.6s)]
*  where we have publicly traded companies that exist to create a difference between how much they pay out in health benefits versus how much they recoup in premiums. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=238.76s)]
*  Like their job is to maximize that differential. We built a whole system around it. That's fucking stupid. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=249.48s)]
*  That is terrible. That causes all kinds of harms. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=254.4s)]
*  But like the idea that we're going to associate the murder of a health executive with Medicare for all to me does not bring us anywhere closer to Medicare for all. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=256.88s)]
*  We're not going to shoot our way to universal health care. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=264.84000000000003s)]
*  And it ends up becoming a kind of vicious and negative and divisive debate, a debate we can win without kind of needing to resort to this sort of like ridiculous kind of performative. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=268.2s)]
*  I don't know what you'd call it, theatrics, heroics. I don't know. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=281.72s)]
*  Yeah, people can make jokes. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=285.76s)]
*  The reason I don't make them is because I just think the people all have families and think about it on a human level. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=288.56s)]
*  And then also, you know, deciding that we're tacitly supporting targeted assassination is the slipperiest of slopes, in my view. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=294.04s)]
*  And I saw people saying, well, you know, UnitedHealth health care is responsible for more deaths because they deny claims. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=301.64s)]
*  What if someone decides that rationale applies to like, you know, abortion rights groups and goes after their CEOs? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=307.20000000000005s)]
*  Right. I just think copycat violence is a real problem. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=313.44s)]
*  So let's just not celebrate this stuff. That said, everyone has had a terrible interaction with the insurance company. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=316.6s)]
*  Every single person, the insurers reject one in seven claims for treatment. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=322.04s)]
*  ProPublica had a really long investigation in February of 2023 that's worth reading about UnitedHealth care. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=326.32000000000005s)]
*  It's one story about the treatment of a patient who finally found an effective treatment for a debilitating disease that was wildly expensive. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=332.8s)]
*  He was denied. His family then sued. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=342.56s)]
*  And they got access to all these recorded calls and documents and things that just outlined the way UnitedHealth care put profits ahead of his health care or anything else and lied and did all these horrible things. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=345.52s)]
*  But I think the net effect of this incident is probably going to be that a bunch of corporate CEOs getting armed security and their customers pay for it. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=357.0s)]
*  And that's the frustrating part. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=365.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. According to the New York Times, some people on social media said that people who have information about the killing shouldn't share it with authorities. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=367.08s)]
*  The hostel that he was staying in was cooperating with the authorities and they got threats because they were cooperating. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=375.56s)]
*  Some people posted names and pictures of other health insurance executives. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=382.2s)]
*  I'm going to take the I'll take the the neolib squishy centrist position that murder. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=385.40000000000003s)]
*  Let's hear it. Murder is bad. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=390.08000000000004s)]
*  Also denying people life saving health care because they can't afford it. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=392.48s)]
*  Bad. How about that? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=396.12s)]
*  Wow. That's incredible. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=397.96000000000004s)]
*  How about that? Incredible. Incredible. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=399.28000000000003s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=400.36s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=400.88s)]
*  I'm out there. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=401.40000000000003s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=401.92s)]
*  I hope all the murders are caught and punished. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=402.44s)]
*  Also hope we pass more laws to make sure that everyone can get the health care they need without the insurance company putting them through hell, which insurance companies frequently do. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=405.04s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like the other question like why do we have a system where all these people have horror stories, like terrible stories about what it's like to engage with these companies. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=413.88s)]
*  These companies exist to deny claims and make life harder. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=424.28s)]
*  And, you know, Barack Obama used to tell stories about what it was like when his mother had cancer and how you're you're dealing with the worst moment of your life and you're on the phone with insurance companies. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=426.96s)]
*  Like, why does this system exist? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=434.24s)]
*  And, you know, the like the debate online. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=436.08s)]
*  Fine. It's not real life. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=440.76s)]
*  But I do think it captures something that is real about the health care debate, which is there are all these people that are screaming like the system is fucking stupid. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=442.52s)]
*  It is stupid. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=449.76s)]
*  Right. And yet when you try to change it, you run into this buzzsaw. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=450.64s)]
*  Now, part of that is because the insurance lobby donates a lot to campaigns. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=453.67999999999995s)]
*  They run a lot of ads. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=459.59999999999997s)]
*  There's a lot of anti-government, anti-Medicare propaganda, a lot of right wing propaganda about this. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=460.96s)]
*  But the reality is, when you ask people, do you like your insurance? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=465.56s)]
*  The vast majority say they do. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=469.88s)]
*  Even when a majority of those people say they've had problems with their health insurance, that one in six say that they've had claims that they could never resolve. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=472.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=479.92s)]
*  They could never resolve. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=480.24s)]
*  Just just to put some statistics there, like Kaiser Family Foundation did very large poll last June of last year, June of 23. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=481.32s)]
*  Eighty one percent of people give their health insurance a rating of excellent or good. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=489.44s)]
*  Now, if you're in poor health, that number falls, but it falls to 68 percent. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=493.15999999999997s)]
*  Still pretty high. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=497.03999999999996s)]
*  Fifty eight percent say they've had a problem with their health insurance in the last year, though half of those people say it was resolved to their satisfaction. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=498.23999999999995s)]
*  And then 27 percent, so one in three people say in the last year they've had a specific issue with a claim denial or the insurance company paying less than they had hoped the insurance company would pay. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=505.12s)]
*  Clearly a problem. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=516.36s)]
*  To your point, though, let's talk about what's happened. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=517.36s)]
*  Let's talk about what the barriers are. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=520.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=521.8s)]
*  What happened in when we tried to pass the Affordable Care Act, right, which was a Herculean effort that cost a lot of Democrats their jobs, a lot of House members. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=522.16s)]
*  Everyone talks about what happened in 2010 and like why didn't down ballot win and was it O.F.A. or this or that? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=531.76s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=537.0s)]
*  Bunch of people took the vote, knew that they would probably lose because they took the vote for Affordable Care Act, but they thought it was important enough to do anyway. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=537.4s)]
*  And they did it. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=545.0s)]
*  The Affordable Care Act, which didn't even pass with the public option because we didn't have the vote for public option, which still isn't single payer. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=545.84s)]
*  We passed a bunch of insurance company reforms that put a bunch of new regulations on insurance companies, but we couldn't get more than that. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=551.44s)]
*  Fast forward to the 2020 Democratic primary where the central debate in the primary was over Medicare for all. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=559.4000000000001s)]
*  And what happened there? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=566.1600000000001s)]
*  Medicare for all ended up less popular than it started at the beginning of the at the primary, because when you ask people, should the government guarantee health insurance, people say yes. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=567.72s)]
*  Like 60 percent say yes. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=578.1600000000001s)]
*  When you ask people, do you think it should be a government run system or a private insurance system? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=579.84s)]
*  More people want private insurance than they do government. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=585.28s)]
*  That number has narrowed now, but that's still so it is not. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=587.9200000000001s)]
*  It is a problem with the insurance industry. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=590.76s)]
*  It is a problem with their lobby. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=592.32s)]
*  It is a problem with the money in politics. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=593.6s)]
*  It is certainly a problem with the Republican Party. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=595.12s)]
*  But it's also we have work to do convincing people to change this system. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=597.32s)]
*  Well, it's also I think look, I think the fact that profit is in the health care system is the original senior. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=603.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=609.4399999999999s)]
*  The thing that we would all want to get rid of. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=609.64s)]
*  But if we were doing it over again, we would have profit in the system. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=611.24s)]
*  Single payer Medicare for all type system. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=614.72s)]
*  The challenge that you outlined, though, is getting people to trust that the government is going to competently administer that system is also a great challenge. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=617.3199999999999s)]
*  I imagine that challenge was not aided by the rollout of health care dot gov during the ACA fight and rollout in the second Obama term. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=625.0s)]
*  So well, let's talk about why that was such a challenge. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=634.0799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=637.04s)]
*  In 2013, as part of the Affordable Care Act, we said, look, if insurance companies try to give people these shitty plans that don't cover anything where they're paying a lot of money, but they still can't get good coverage. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=637.8000000000001s)]
*  What the government's going to do is say, we're going to cancel those plans and the government cancel those plans. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=650.24s)]
*  And suddenly there was a fucking uproar like you wouldn't believe because people said, I thought I could keep my health insurance if I liked my health insurance. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=655.84s)]
*  Because of the line that you had to include when you were campaigning to reform the health care system, which is if you like your plan, you can keep your plan, which was going to be true for 98% of people. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=662.24s)]
*  But the website didn't work. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=671.08s)]
*  But I was saying the bigger one was the real political problem was why did we get all these cancellations? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=673.5200000000001s)]
*  And now people like, well, everyone hates their health insurance plan. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=678.48s)]
*  Well, actually, you know, we tried to cancel a bunch of really shitty plans that didn't do a lot to cover people. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=681.6800000000001s)]
*  And there was a fucking uproar. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=685.76s)]
*  So that's not to say that we of course we should try again, but it is much more complicated with actual people. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=687.5600000000001s)]
*  The other part of this is like, oh, people people also say they're comfortable with expanding insurance by the government. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=694.24s)]
*  They just like I do think like, OK, so half the country roughly has health insurance through their employer. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=700.0s)]
*  That is the system we built. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=707.1600000000001s)]
*  That is a convoluted, broken system that creates a bunch of perverse incentives. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=708.6800000000001s)]
*  It means that insurers don't cover don't have much of an incentive to cover preventative care, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=713.04s)]
*  because if you change jobs, you change insurers, creates a whole host of problems. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=717.76s)]
*  Small percentage of people buy their own insurance, about 10 percent. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=720.64s)]
*  The rest are either uninsured or in the public systems. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=723.76s)]
*  We already have a huge chunk of the country in public health care. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=726.12s)]
*  And that poll that John talked about, it said that 81 percent of people like their private insurance. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=729.52s)]
*  It's even higher for Medicare. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=735.64s)]
*  Medicare is extremely popular. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=737.48s)]
*  And I do think like the point that Ro Khanna makes in that in that interview is smart, right? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=739.48s)]
*  Like that private insurance should cover anything Medicare should cover. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=743.5600000000001s)]
*  He's thinking about the ways in which to make private insurance more like Medicare, basically, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=745.8800000000001s)]
*  which costs far less to administer. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=751.48s)]
*  Right. There's a huge percentage of of of private insurance costs go towards administration. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=753.12s)]
*  What's administration? It's paying the staff that reviews claims, tries to make their costs low. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=757.24s)]
*  Right. It's money that goes to getting worse health care than actually paying providers. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=760.5600000000001s)]
*  But like part of what happens when you end up only debating when the debate becomes about, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=766.04s)]
*  are you for single payer or against single payers? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=770.9599999999999s)]
*  You don't have other debates. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=773.88s)]
*  A debate like should we lower the Medicare eligibility age to 60? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=775.48s)]
*  How about that? Or I was going to say to your point about people liking Medicare so much, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=779.04s)]
*  I think that the plan offered in 2020 that was both the best plan, but also the most politically [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=783.92s)]
*  palatable plan that most people liked it was remember, Pete Buttigieg proposed Medicare for [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=789.1999999999999s)]
*  all who want it. Yes. And so basically it would allow anyone if you really want Medicare and you [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=794.84s)]
*  want to be covered by Medicare, you can choose that. And if you really don't want that and you [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=799.72s)]
*  really want your private health insurance plan, you can choose that. And the idea would be that [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=803.88s)]
*  Medicare would be so popular that more and more people would buy in and we would eventually [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=806.9200000000001s)]
*  transition to a system where Medicare covers everyone. There's a lot of yes, that was sort [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=810.2800000000001s)]
*  of a form of a public option. But like you lower the Medicare like, you know, the public option [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=813.96s)]
*  was killed from Obamacare and it was killed by a bunch of senators. They all hid behind Joe [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=818.2800000000001s)]
*  Lieberman was killed by a bunch of people. But one thing that Joe Lieberman personally killed was [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=822.28s)]
*  the Medicare buy-in for people. And that was just a policy to help. Like if you were between the [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=825.48s)]
*  ages of 60 and 65, that is where your health, you're not yet in Medicare, but you still are in the [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=831.4s)]
*  age where you're starting to have more and more health problems. It's extremely expensive group [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=836.36s)]
*  to ensure if you get laid off when you're 58, you're incredibly expensive. Like there's a huge [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=839.48s)]
*  bunch of problems that happen there. And Joe, Joe Lieberman personally killed a Medicare buy-in, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=843.88s)]
*  but like if we could get the Medicare age down to 60, it costs about $25 billion a year, a tiny, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=847.8s)]
*  tiny fraction of the budget. And that alone would bring healthcare costs down for fucking everybody [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=853.0s)]
*  just by dint of getting this pool of expensive people to ensure off. But like these are the kinds [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=859.16s)]
*  of things I think we should be talking about, like simple fixes that get us on the road to Medicare [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=862.92s)]
*  for all. Because if you're, if you, if like, if like, like Rose, Ro Khanna said, like you're not [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=867.3199999999999s)]
*  surprised by the reaction. There's an incredible amount of anger and antipathy towards health [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=874.12s)]
*  insurance companies. We should target it. We should direct it towards a political aim that [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=877.0s)]
*  could actually help people as soon as possible. Well, guess what? If, if there were democratic [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=881.64s)]
*  majorities in Congress and democratic president, we'd, we'd get a public option. We didn't last [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=887.32s)]
*  time around, even though Joe Biden proposed it because we had Kirsten Sinema and Joe Manchin. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=891.32s)]
*  If we had won the Senate this time around and won the house and won the presidency, then we'd be [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=894.6s)]
*  talking about a public option for a second time. And these should be part of the, like, when we [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=899.08s)]
*  talk about like, what are Democrats for? We spent a long, you know, what is our big agenda for the [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=902.12s)]
*  future? Like these kinds of big changes had to be part of it. All right. President-elect Donald [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=906.44s)]
*  Trump sat down with Kristen Welker and meet the press for a pretty newsy and substantive [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=912.2s)]
*  interview that lasted one hour and 16 minutes. I wonder how long his staff was trying to call it. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=915.8000000000001s)]
*  30 minutes, 20 minutes. I didn't know it was that long. And I just started reading the transcript [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=922.12s)]
*  and I was like, why does this keep going? It must just budget an hour. It's crazy. It's very long. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=926.5200000000001s)]
*  There were a few big topics they went in depth on, and we're just going to take them one at a [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=931.72s)]
*  time, play some clips so you can get a feel for what it was like without having to suffer through [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=936.28s)]
*  the whole thing like we did. Yeah, that's a service we provide. You do not, we watch the whole thing [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=940.4399999999999s)]
*  so you don't have to. Let's start with immigration. They covered a lot here, including big questions [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=944.52s)]
*  on deportations and citizenship. Here's a sampling. If they come here illegally, but their family is [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=950.36s)]
*  here legally, then the family has a choice. The person that came in illegally can go out or they [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=955.3199999999999s)]
*  can all go out together. You promised to end birthright citizenship on day one. Is that still [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=961.32s)]
*  your plan? Yeah, absolutely. So even though Trump wants to end birthright citizenship, he also said [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=966.5200000000001s)]
*  he wants to work with Democrats on a solution for the dreamers who he spoke favorably about. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=972.2800000000001s)]
*  Let's talk about birthright citizenship first, which I think is the big headline here. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=978.5200000000001s)]
*  Ending it, at least for the children of undocumented parents, something of a right wing [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=983.6400000000001s)]
*  passion project. It's also birthright citizenship is also guaranteed in the Constitution and the [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=989.16s)]
*  14th Amendment. Do you guys think he actually can end this? I think he wants to fight. I don't think [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=994.04s)]
*  he knows or particularly cares if he can end it. You know, it's yet another place where the [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1000.28s)]
*  Constitution is unequivocal. And yet we're having this debate because we don't know if [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1006.68s)]
*  six conservative justices will agree anymore. That's the reason we can have this debate. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1012.28s)]
*  But I think he wants to fight. So you think he would just do something, test it in court, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1018.12s)]
*  see if the Supreme Court, not go through like the constitutional amendment process? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1023.0799999999999s)]
*  So he said both. He doesn't have the, he wouldn't get the votes. He doesn't have the discipline. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1027.56s)]
*  But he didn't, he says that, he said, you know, throughout this interview, it was a lot of moments [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1032.2s)]
*  of Welker trying to say, trying to pin him down. And his whole sort of stance throughout the [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1038.2s)]
*  interview was just refusing to be pinned down. So this is one of the places where he did that, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1044.6s)]
*  too. And he said, well, we may have to bring it to the people. But then he brought it back [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1048.1999999999998s)]
*  to the executive order and talked about the executive order he was going to issue when he [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1051.8s)]
*  was president. It just so listeners know, it's very hard to amend the Constitution just to propose [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1054.6s)]
*  an amendment to the Constitution. You require, you need support from two thirds of both houses [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1058.4399999999998s)]
*  of Congress or two thirds of state legislature. And then the bar is higher to three fourths to [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1062.84s)]
*  ratify it. So yeah, not gonna happen. Supreme Court said something about this back in 1898. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1067.8799999999999s)]
*  They ruled that birthright citizenship is part of the 14th Amendment. They said the rule in there [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1074.6s)]
*  was the 14th Amendment affirms the ancient and fundamental rule of citizenship by birth within [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1079.9599999999998s)]
*  the territory, including all children here born of resident aliens. The only qualification, the [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1084.28s)]
*  reason that the right keeps talking about this and has for a while is there's a qualification in the [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1090.04s)]
*  14th Amendment that says children born in the US have to be quote, subject to the jurisdiction [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1094.28s)]
*  thereof. But of course, undocumented immigrants are subject to US jurisdiction and that they [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1099.16s)]
*  can be sanctioned for violating the law. Right. They're not ambassadors. Right. That's what I [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1104.8400000000001s)]
*  want to say. The only people who aren't subject to US jurisdiction are foreign diplomats with [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1108.52s)]
*  diplomatic immunity. That's why that exception is in the Constitution. Something I am sure [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1112.6000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump has ranted about when all those ambassadors were racking up tickets in Manhattan [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1117.24s)]
*  over all those years. There's no doubt that Donald Trump fucking hated seeing those diplomatic plates. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1123.72s)]
*  Parked in the fucking fire zones. There's also a Trump appointee in the Fifth Circuit that just [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1129.08s)]
*  ruled in 2015 that the clause covers quote, the vast majority of lawful and unlawful aliens. So [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1132.92s)]
*  it is a pretty, I mean, again, it's this Supreme Court, so who knows, but you could see Roberts. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1139.48s)]
*  You could see, I mean, it's, it seems unlikely. What do you guys make of the cognitive dissonance [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1144.6s)]
*  between saying he, he wants to protect the dreamers who are children who were brought here, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1150.04s)]
*  undocumented children who were brought here by their parents as kids. But he also thinks [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1157.08s)]
*  that kids born here shouldn't get citizenship. Yeah. So it's interesting. I actually thought the [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1163.08s)]
*  dreamers, the part where he talked with the dreamers was the most interesting part of this [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1167.8s)]
*  section because he actually was more compassionate in his language than he's been in a very long time. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1172.6s)]
*  Not ever, but a long time. He used to say, he said to me, he said to me, he's like, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1179.6399999999999s)]
*  you got to do something. Some of them are great people. You got to do something. We're going to [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1184.36s)]
*  do something for them. That's what he used to say when he was president. Yes. So he has not, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1186.9199999999998s)]
*  he did not talk that way throughout the entire campaign. So I think the contradiction is that [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1190.9199999999998s)]
*  he doesn't care and he's not thinking about it that way. When he talks about birthright [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1195.24s)]
*  citizenship, he's talking about, you know, he's ranted about tourists having babies from Asia. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1197.9599999999998s)]
*  He's talking about people that just got here. What he's, when he's referring to the dreamers, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1204.04s)]
*  he's actually acknowledging what has been at the core of the democratic position on this, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1207.0s)]
*  which is you need to have a system of rules and laws going forward, but you need to recognize [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1211.56s)]
*  that people have been in this country for a very long time. It's sort of acknowledging [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1216.12s)]
*  both sides of that. Yeah, I just think he's a liar. I don't think, I mean, if he wanted to [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1220.6799999999998s)]
*  protect the dreamers, there's a deal on the table with the Democrats that he could pass tomorrow. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1224.6s)]
*  Just do it, protect them, go for it. I mean, he, he, he got that. There was an offer in 2018, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1228.6799999999998s)]
*  2019 that was basically protection for the dreamers in exchange for billions of wall funding. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1233.48s)]
*  And Democrats walked away from it because of the wall funding at the time. But again, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1238.6s)]
*  they could pass a narrow fix for the dreamers. I think, man, wish we had taken that deal. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1241.6399999999999s)]
*  I do too. Well, I think that, but I think that tells you like, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1245.6399999999999s)]
*  liar or not, like, I think he would take that deal. I think that can still happen. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1248.44s)]
*  Yeah, maybe I was saying he would love the win. I think he's a guy who doesn't want to get blamed [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1251.8s)]
*  for ugly images on TV, but ultimately supports an incredibly radical immigration agenda that includes [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1255.08s)]
*  mass deportations of tens of millions of people. Yeah. It feels like a past versus future thing. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1262.2s)]
*  Yeah. You know, that he, you protect the children of undocumented immigrants who are already here, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1267.88s)]
*  but you don't allow the children of future undocumented immigrants to become citizens. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1271.8s)]
*  Because like you said, he believes that this birth tourism, that people come here illegally [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1276.44s)]
*  and have children as like, this is the whole quote unquote anchor babies that, I mean, it's just, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1282.44s)]
*  he wants, he doesn't want people, right. He wants to, he wants to have, after a certain date, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1287.3999999999999s)]
*  be able to deport people without having to consider the fact that the children born here [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1291.24s)]
*  are American citizens. He wants to have a date after which he doesn't have to worry about that [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1295.72s)]
*  anymore. But unfortunately the constitution says otherwise. Also, there's a bigger consequences [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1299.96s)]
*  here. If you suddenly decide that citizenship in the United States is not, is not granted because [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1303.56s)]
*  you're born here. Like the, the, the amount of people that you could start stripping citizenship [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1309.32s)]
*  from is just, it goes on for, it's crazy. Getting rid of birth, I actually did this crazy. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1313.64s)]
*  But we'll see, I mean, they're going to try for executive, executive orders. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1320.2s)]
*  Or, or they want, we don't like, again, like it's just like, this was an interview where. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1323.72s)]
*  I mean, it seems like they're, the Wall Street Journal says they are drafting an order. So it [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1327.48s)]
*  seems like they're going to at least try, but whether what happens to what happens next, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1330.6000000000001s)]
*  we don't know. Yeah. I just like, he is, it's, it was a strange interview in that, like basically [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1333.88s)]
*  on a few different, few different places, Walker was like challenging. Did you really mean this? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1339.16s)]
*  And every single time he said, of course it did. Of course it did. But then he does this sort of [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1342.92s)]
*  more moderate sounding language on dreamers, on a few other issues. So it was like an interview [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1346.52s)]
*  where he was making himself hard to pin down. It sounds like the deportation plan is to start [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1352.3600000000001s)]
*  with immigrants who've committed crimes here in America, but then go far beyond that to include [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1358.2s)]
*  undocumented immigrants who've been here for years, have jobs, pay taxes, live with American [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1362.8400000000001s)]
*  citizen family members. We've talked a lot about Democrats not becoming the defenders of the status [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1367.24s)]
*  quo, but obviously immigration was one of the defining issues, the campaign. How do you guys [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1372.84s)]
*  think Democrats should fight this or can fight this really? Well, I mean, we know there's a bunch [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1377.8799999999999s)]
*  of states where the attorney generals are preparing legal challenges. Groups like the ACLU will, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1381.8799999999999s)]
*  will challenge in court any effort to use the military to deport people. And then there will [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1389.72s)]
*  be cities that will refuse to work with ICE and prevent deportation operations. So that's kind of [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1394.52s)]
*  the policy side. Then I think part of it is Democrats, I mean, this starts to happen. You [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1400.36s)]
*  start seeing families ripped apart. You start to see, you know, who's going to go well beyond [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1404.36s)]
*  criminals, these sort of deportations. It's going to be farm workers, students, people who served [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1410.84s)]
*  in the military, teachers. I think you have to like lift up those stories and talk about the impact [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1414.28s)]
*  on communities. Yeah, there was a moment in the interview where he said something he hadn't said [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1418.9199999999998s)]
*  before where Welker's asking about all these, about the kind of impact of all this kind of [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1424.1999999999998s)]
*  mass deportation. He says, well, you know, they're these criminals, they're hiding, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1429.24s)]
*  they're in our cities, they're on our farms. And it was a strange, like, wait, you don't, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1432.92s)]
*  he has, he doesn't talk like that. It doesn't reference the fact that undocumented people [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1439.72s)]
*  do a ton of the labor on, on farms in this country. And it was, it felt like reflective [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1444.44s)]
*  of some kind of conversation he had had where, where it's clear that this rounding up of people [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1450.44s)]
*  is going to impact the nation's food supply. And so he's starting to think about how to message [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1455.48s)]
*  around the impact of that. I don't know, but it was strange. Yeah, I think the hard reality of [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1459.56s)]
*  this is that it's very difficult to fight deportation since Trump is well within the law. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1463.72s)]
*  And past presidents of both parties have deported undocumented immigrants. You can, cities can try [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1469.64s)]
*  not to cooperate with ICE. You know, Tom Homan, the new borders are said, if they don't cooperate, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1476.6s)]
*  I'll just have my agents do it. It's whatever we don't need their cooperation. And but I do think [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1481.16s)]
*  you show, like Tommy said, how, you know, cruel and unnecessary and harmful it is to the country [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1487.3200000000002s)]
*  to expel people who are doing nothing more but trying to live their lives, do their jobs, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1492.8400000000001s)]
*  haven't committed any crimes. We're giving back a lot to the country contributing to the economy, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1498.68s)]
*  to society in a million different ways. I was paying paying, by the way, also just one other [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1502.3600000000001s)]
*  lie in all of this undocumented people are paying into Medicare and Social Security and [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1506.12s)]
*  not able to ever recoup it. He also lied and says we're the only country in the world that does [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1511.48s)]
*  birthright citizenship. That is totally wrong. Dozens of countries do it. The Canadians do it. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1515.24s)]
*  Chile, like lots of countries. I think another challenge for Democrats is because they are [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1519.96s)]
*  going to start with criminals or people who have committed crimes here in America. Obviously, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1523.6399999999999s)]
*  you break the law if you cross the border unlawfully. But for the people who have committed [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1529.08s)]
*  crimes here in America, they're going to make a big deal out of them and then sort of try to [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1533.48s)]
*  bait Democrats into, you know, look, the reason that that there are to the extent that there are [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1537.56s)]
*  people who've committed violent crimes or either other crimes in America who are undocumented. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1542.1200000000001s)]
*  The reason they're still here is not because the Biden administration or other Democrats just [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1546.6s)]
*  didn't want to go after them. Part of it is because either they can't find them or, you know, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1550.84s)]
*  law enforcement's been looking for them, but can't find them. Or sometimes people are here [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1556.52s)]
*  because we don't have agreements with the countries that they came from to send them back to those [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1559.88s)]
*  countries. And so there's a number of challenges, just logistical challenges the Trump administration [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1564.1200000000001s)]
*  is going to have to grapple with just in order to do some of these deportations. I read that [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1569.88s)]
*  they're actually thinking of sending some of these undocumented immigrants back to countries [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1575.0s)]
*  that aren't their home countries because they don't have the agreements with all the countries, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1579.0800000000002s)]
*  which is just- And this is where Tom Homan's full of shit, the immigration czar. Sure, ICE could [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1584.2800000000002s)]
*  go to a community and find someone and take them and deport them, but they're going to have a hard [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1589.8s)]
*  time finding them. That's the part that you need the local cops for is the law enforcement piece, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1593.8s)]
*  tracking people down, knowing where they are. Yeah, but it's going to be hard. And I also think the [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1597.56s)]
*  Democrats just need to be clear in laying out the alternative, right? Which is we, of course, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1601.96s)]
*  support going after criminals and people who've committed crimes in this country and also, you [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1606.76s)]
*  know, people who've just arrived here or like, let's, we're fine with removing people, recent [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1613.72s)]
*  arrivals, right? But people who have been here for years who just want the chance to become [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1619.0s)]
*  citizens, we should give them the chance to become citizens and we should bring them out of the [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1624.12s)]
*  shadows so that they can contribute, which is what they want to do in this country. I think you just [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1627.56s)]
*  have to be very clear about the message. Yeah, I think you have to, I also think like this interview [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1631.96s)]
*  that Trump gave is an opportunity for Democrats to say like, okay, we will do your, we have a [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1636.04s)]
*  conservative border bill right now. We will tie that with protections for finally letting these [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1641.0s)]
*  dreamers who did nothing wrong and who only know this country to become citizens, which you now say [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1648.44s)]
*  is something you want to do. So let's do that right now. How about that's the first thing. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1653.8s)]
*  That's one of the first things you can do when you become president. We should be out there [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1657.4s)]
*  taking him at his word. All right, let's talk about what to make of Trump's answers on whether [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1660.2s)]
*  he'll actually go after his political enemies. Here he is answering questions about the January [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1664.8400000000001s)]
*  6th committee. I think those people committed a major crime and Cheney was behind it. And so [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1669.88s)]
*  is Benny Thompson and everybody on that committee. We're going to for what they did. Yeah, honestly, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1675.08s)]
*  they should go to jail. So you think Liz Cheney should go to jail for what everyone on the committee? [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1682.04s)]
*  You think everybody on the anybody that voted in favor? Do you want cash Patel to launch [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1688.9199999999998s)]
*  investigations into people on that list? No, I mean, he's going to do what he thinks is right. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1693.72s)]
*  If they think that somebody was dishonest or crooked or corrupt politician, I think he probably [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1698.28s)]
*  has an obligation to do it. But are you going to direct him to do? No, not at all. I'm not looking [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1703.88s)]
*  to go back into the past. I'm looking to make our country successful. Retribution will be through [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1709.3200000000002s)]
*  success. All right. Where do you think we are on the spectrum of our rule of law to Trump decides [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1716.0400000000002s)]
*  who goes to jail? Just some pure uncut fascism there. Yeah, you know, it's funny before that section, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1722.44s)]
*  he's saying the right things. I'm not I don't want I'm not going to tell cash, but tell what to do. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1729.72s)]
*  I'm paying bond. He's great. I'm not going to tell her what to do. They're going to do what they want [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1734.2s)]
*  to do. I don't want to go backwards. I'm not. That's what Biden did. I'm not for that. And then the [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1737.48s)]
*  second welcome brings up the select committee. He's like jail, jail for every fucking one of them who [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1741.72s)]
*  voted every who voted for it. Jail. Well, we we don't hear the end of that sentence. I think maybe [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1746.52s)]
*  you meant on the committee because weren't there on the committee. Yeah, that's right. You vote for [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1751.0s)]
*  vote against me and you're going to jail and just pure adulterated fascists. Yes. Also, the [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1755.0s)]
*  Constitution has protections specifically designed to protect legislators from the executive for [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1758.84s)]
*  doing their jobs. Not something that comes up in the interview. It also reminded me that there was [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1764.12s)]
*  a part in that Atlantic profile of Patel that said he's the kind of guy you don't have to tell [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1769.3999999999999s)]
*  him to do it. That's why that question was dumb. That's why you chose cash. Patel is an enemy's [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1775.8s)]
*  list in his book. Like why you chose Pam Bondi to well, I guess, Matt Gates washed out, but why she [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1780.4399999999998s)]
*  was your second choice? Because you don't need to tell these people what to do. They know they're [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1786.36s)]
*  there to punish your enemies. Yeah, you could read it two ways, I think, which is one exactly how we [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1789.1599999999999s)]
*  just talked about it, how you guys just talked about it. The other is he genuinely doesn't want [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1797.08s)]
*  to go back and doesn't want this. Doesn't want to have all these investigations. But you bring up [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1802.04s)]
*  things that he's pissed about and that he's talked about before. He's going to set them off because [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1807.56s)]
*  the man has no control of his emotions. And also he's never been someone who's like, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1811.72s)]
*  you know, I changed my mind. I actually like Liz Cheney. Let bygones be gone. He's always going [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1818.5200000000002s)]
*  to be like, yes, she should go to jail, but I'm not going to make anything happen. Right? Now, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1823.16s)]
*  again, the huge problem here is whether or not you believe Trump, whether or not he means he really [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1828.68s)]
*  is going to make them go to jail or he doesn't want to go back to the past, Cash Patel and Pam [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1835.48s)]
*  Bondi are the problem because they'll either take his comments as a green light to go investigate [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1841.08s)]
*  and prosecute or they may just decide to do whatever the fuck they want, knowing that Trump [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1847.8799999999999s)]
*  either won't care or he will approve and they will curry favor with that. Glad he's glad they're [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1852.1999999999998s)]
*  doing it despite his lack of intervention, which is sort of an ideal outcome for him. Yeah, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1857.3999999999999s)]
*  just stepping back, this was the most unleashed Trump in this entire interview. It's an hour and [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1861.08s)]
*  16 minute interview. It was much more like Trump on Rogan where the clips are taken out of context [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1869.64s)]
*  to make it seem like the most dangerous and kind of unhinged version of Trump. But for the majority [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1875.24s)]
*  of this interview, he is trying to seem as reasonable and mainstream as humanly possible. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1881.3200000000002s)]
*  And he I think does succeed in a lot of places. This was one place where it was like, whoa, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1889.8000000000002s)]
*  he's definitely going beyond his, his whatever goals he had for this interview, he has left [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1894.1200000000001s)]
*  those behind to start railing against Liz Cheney. The one thought I had while watching it was a [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1899.32s)]
*  little galaxy brain, which is like, man, this is not somebody like this is baiting Joe Biden [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1905.56s)]
*  into pardons. That's what I was like, why would you go so hard at these people right now? You're [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1911.56s)]
*  so careful throughout the rest of it to try to seem more disciplined. I think he just has no [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1916.4399999999998s)]
*  impulse control. Yeah, I agree. I think Liz Cheney is bait. I think it's like that. It's just, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1921.96s)]
*  he's just triggered by hearing Liz Cheney in January. Same thing when she mentioned 2020. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1926.76s)]
*  It's wild to me that one of the questions was like, do you did you win the 2020 election? [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1931.8799999999999s)]
*  Like, oh, we're going back there now. But like, there are certain things, not certain things, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1935.96s)]
*  there's a lot of things you can say to Trump to set him off. He is also very mad that the [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1939.72s)]
*  January 6 committee destroyed all their records and evidence and things that's [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1945.08s)]
*  prosecutable now. The whole thing. He's very mad. I think he's seeking retribution. He was trying [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1948.68s)]
*  to be serious. But the minute you push him is like he's electrocuted. But I do think I guess [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1953.96s)]
*  where I come down on this is I would not be surprised if they do launch investigations [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1959.56s)]
*  and try to do everything he had said during the campaign he wanted to do. I would also [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1964.6000000000001s)]
*  not be surprised if nothing happens. Yeah, it's all look, Joe Biden, it's, it's, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1968.8400000000001s)]
*  but if I was Biden, I think I that's I mean, if I was Biden, I think I would, I would, I would do, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1976.44s)]
*  I think really hard about preemptive pardons and blanket pardons for the J six committee [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1981.96s)]
*  and Jack Smith and his team and I would do the team and I would do the staff I would do like for [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1989.56s)]
*  for anyone who was caught up in federal employees who were investigating Donald Trump in some way, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=1995.16s)]
*  I would think seriously about pardons. Yeah, I just, you know, it's like an umbrella, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2001.0s)]
*  you know, you're, it's okay, if you have it, you don't need it. Better than to need it and not [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2007.64s)]
*  have it. And we don't we will not we do not get to go back and man, Joe Biden, look, I think it's why [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2012.0400000000002s)]
*  he pardoned Hunter. He doesn't want to look back and realize he had this chance to save his son [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2016.76s)]
*  didn't take it. Well, you know, it's time to use that in the same way for the rest of us. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2020.5200000000002s)]
*  He also talked about pardoning the January 6 protesters, rioters who were who have been [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2026.6000000000001s)]
*  convicted, who pled guilty, who are currently serving time in prison. He said that's a day one [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2035.8s)]
*  thing that he's going to do. Do you think people are going to care about that? [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2042.36s)]
*  I do. I mean, like, I don't think the voters want to look back. And this is looking back. And I think, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2046.9199999999998s)]
*  you know, here's what I think we should we have to do that the Republicans are very good at picking [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2052.52s)]
*  out a couple specific stories and examples and lifting them up right like Lake and Riley, any [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2057.72s)]
*  sort of incident of horrible crime against an individual by an undocumented migrant Trump will [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2062.36s)]
*  tell that story ad nauseam. We need to not just like look at the statistics around January 6 or [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2069.56s)]
*  talk about it in the big picture. We need to find individuals that he pardons who are hitting cops [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2074.44s)]
*  or beating people up or being violent and get the footage of that and the stories of those individuals [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2081.32s)]
*  out on day one. I do not think that people I mean, I think the polling on this was like 30 percent [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2086.2000000000003s)]
*  support for pardoning January 6 insurrectionists. Yeah, I saw I said Tarrient had this on CNN. It [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2090.84s)]
*  was like 33 percent said they were patriots. 64 percent were opposed to pardons. One percent [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2096.36s)]
*  wanted to be a priority, which he's clearly making a priority if it's on day one. And 53 percent think [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2101.32s)]
*  that what the rioters did was an insurrection. So the public opinion is clear. I totally agree with [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2107.2400000000002s)]
*  you, Tommy, that like you've got to and he kind of danced. She goes back and forth. This is what I [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2112.2000000000003s)]
*  was going to get at. Yes, she goes back and forth on the police officers. Like what about the people [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2116.44s)]
*  who violently assaulted police officers? Some of the way that was written up had Trump responding [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2121.0s)]
*  by saying they had no choice. He wasn't saying I don't think he was saying they had no choice to [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2125.7200000000003s)]
*  assault the police officers. He was referring to a different part of her question, which was [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2130.04s)]
*  they pled guilty. He's saying they have no choice to plead guilty because it was like a forced [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2133.96s)]
*  confession kind of thing. Well, it's amazing how realistic Donald Trump can be about the criminal [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2138.36s)]
*  justice system when it's his own fucking people. Like the jail, the jail is not fit for people. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2143.24s)]
*  And oh, well, you understand that people take plea deals just to get out of something and confess [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2151.08s)]
*  the things that they didn't actually do. Incredibly generous to his own people. Yeah, I think it [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2154.3599999999997s)]
*  matters. The other thing he did throughout this section was bounce around who was going to get [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2158.7599999999998s)]
*  pardoned. Is it who's going to be affected? He really didn't give any straight answer. He avoided [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2163.24s)]
*  it completely. So I think it matters who ends up getting these pardons, right? If it's a blanket [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2168.6s)]
*  pardon for a bunch of people that assaults cops, like we should be fucking talking about it for [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2173.08s)]
*  years. But a huge issue. We should make it. I think this is a one number one, a really big deal out of [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2176.36s)]
*  Trump is letting violent criminals out of jail to roam the streets in your neighborhood. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2181.56s)]
*  This is when you go from yeah, Democrats shouldn't be talking about like democracy because it doesn't [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2186.2s)]
*  really resonate with people. But criminals in your neighborhood who were committing political [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2190.92s)]
*  violence and assaulting cops. Yeah, people don't care about that. Yeah, assaulting cops. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2195.08s)]
*  All right. Trump also talked about his economic plans, including a lengthy back and forth on [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2199.2400000000002s)]
*  tariffs with Trump saying he quote, can't guarantee Americans won't end up paying more. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2204.1200000000003s)]
*  He also said, I can't guarantee that I can't guarantee tomorrow. Yeah, it was very, very, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2210.2000000000003s)]
*  very metaphysical. Very funny. Very funny. He also talked about how his other big priority is [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2214.1200000000003s)]
*  extending the Trump tax cuts, which mostly benefit the richest Americans. He was also asked about [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2219.56s)]
*  raising the minimum wage, but didn't sound as favorable on that, even though he said he would [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2223.96s)]
*  consider it. We've talked about how Democrats need to focus on working class voters issues [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2228.2s)]
*  very early, of course. But how do you think Democrats should respond to the Trump economic [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2233.56s)]
*  agenda? What I took from this, as you would say, Donald Trump has just told us what his priorities [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2237.72s)]
*  are as president to free people that assault cops and cut taxes for the rich. That is those are his [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2242.4399999999996s)]
*  two big priorities, right? It's not raising minimum wage. It's not protecting access to health care. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2247.8799999999997s)]
*  It's not even lowering costs. It's tax cuts for the rich and freeing the people that assaulted [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2254.2s)]
*  the cops on his behalf. And that should tell you something about about what you can expect from [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2260.2s)]
*  Donald Trump over the next four years. Yeah, I would hammer the tax cut issue. I was I was [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2263.72s)]
*  reading a report on the 2017 Trump tax cut. It found that large US pharma companies saved about [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2268.52s)]
*  six billion dollars in taxes over the course of four years. And during that time, they expanded [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2274.3599999999997s)]
*  their workforce by less than one percent globally. So they saved a ton of money on taxes and they [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2278.8399999999997s)]
*  created no jobs. In 2023, Pfizer made over twenty seven billion and paid zero federal income taxes, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2283.48s)]
*  thanks in part to the Trump tax cut, because they make the bulk of their money in the US. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2290.6s)]
*  And then they use loopholes and tax avoidance schemes to recognize that revenue in Ireland or [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2294.52s)]
*  whatever. So this is the opposite of populism. This is the opposite of the bullshit that Steve [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2298.52s)]
*  Bannon and his types try to tell us that the Trump MAGA message is about. And I think we need to [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2303.4s)]
*  really push it hard. I mean, again, like the the riches point one percent of taxpayers got a [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2308.84s)]
*  two hundred fifty thousand dollar tax cut. The poorest quintile in this country got a [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2313.7200000000003s)]
*  seventy dollar tax cut. That's the story of the 2017 Trump tax cut that he is trying to extend. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2318.5200000000004s)]
*  Yeah. And I do think much like your point, Tommy, on the J six riders, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2324.44s)]
*  Democrats are going to have to work hard to publicize and lift up the stories of like who's [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2331.0800000000004s)]
*  going to benefit from the tax cuts? Because my guess is that the Trump folks will sell the tax [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2336.6s)]
*  cut extension as middle class tax cuts. In fact, I wouldn't even be surprised if they gave if they [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2343.08s)]
*  tried to propose, you know, especially with J.D. Vance and that crew in there, like larger tax cuts [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2348.04s)]
*  for the middle class. So they actually are bigger than the seventy dollars they got last time. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2353.7999999999997s)]
*  And I think that we need to lift up the stories of the, you know, big CEOs and billionaires who [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2357.96s)]
*  are getting the tax cut. I also think, by the way, look, there's already companies that have said [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2364.12s)]
*  they're going to raise prices thanks to the tariffs. I think every time a company announces [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2368.12s)]
*  that they're going to raise prices because the tariffs or every time they do raise prices, [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2372.6s)]
*  we need to make a huge fucking deal of it. We can make a huge deal of who's getting the rich [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2375.7999999999997s)]
*  people who are getting tax cuts. And I think we should also talk about people who are making [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2380.68s)]
*  minimum wage and can barely afford to get by. And I think the frame of this is look, we took [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2385.0s)]
*  Trump at his word. You know, he's he ran on making life more affordable for people and cutting costs [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2391.4s)]
*  and he's breaking his promise. He's betraying the people who voted for him. And, you know, [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2397.24s)]
*  what I wouldn't do is say things like, oh, well, too bad. This is what you voted for people or [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2402.6s)]
*  they're idiots or they deserve it because you know, you see this, you know, people are already [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2407.56s)]
*  posting this is like the same people who are like, well, you know, the Latinos and immigrants who [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2411.08s)]
*  voted for them, they deserve it if they get deported. Right. Like this is not when he does [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2415.4s)]
*  this. It is it is he is breaking a promise to people that he made. Yeah. Chipotle just announced [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2420.2s)]
*  that they're raising prices next year. And then you look and they had an incredible increase in [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2425.72s)]
*  profits over the previous year. They're raising costs because they think they can get away with [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2431.72s)]
*  it. And corporations and Donald Trump and the billionaires around him are conspiring to raise [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2434.6s)]
*  prices. They are not focused on what you need. They are focused on each other and you will pay [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2439.96s)]
*  the price. Another big topic in the interview is health care. Welcome, Preston, on the repeal of [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2445.72s)]
*  the Affordable Care Act and on R.F.K. Junior's plans for childhood vaccines. Let's listen. Sir, [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2451.08s)]
*  you said during the campaign you had concepts of a plan. Do you have an actual plan at this point [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2456.68s)]
*  for health care? Yes, we have concepts of a plan that would be better. I'm not against vaccines. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2461.56s)]
*  The polio vaccine is the greatest thing. If somebody told me get rid of the folio vaccine, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2466.8399999999997s)]
*  they're going to have to work real hard to convince me. I think vaccines are, [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2471.08s)]
*  certain vaccines are incredible, but maybe some aren't. And if they aren't, we have to find out. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2477.16s)]
*  Before we get to vaccines, what do you think his answer is their signal about how [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2485.96s)]
*  serious he is about taking on health care reform and going after the ACA again? [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2489.8s)]
*  I don't know that he cares about health policy as much as he hates Obama and acts accordingly. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2495.64s)]
*  I don't know. It seems like he wants credit for all the good parts of the ACA, but maybe doesn't [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2500.2000000000003s)]
*  want to touch that hot stove again. But I don't know. What do you guys think? I agree. I took it. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2505.0800000000004s)]
*  He spent a while talking about how much he did to make Obamacare work, which is his new lie. It's [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2509.2400000000002s)]
*  not true. He sued to get rid of Obamacare. And he even responds to his Welker point setting. He [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2516.84s)]
*  says, well, that's what I was doing to try to get rid of it, but actually administering it. He was [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2521.96s)]
*  trying to sabotage it internally, sabotaging the enrollment periods, making it more difficult to [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2525.4s)]
*  sign up. So he wasn't, he was trying to undermine Obamacare at every turn. But it does seem like he [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2530.2000000000003s)]
*  doesn't want that fight. He understands that the appetite for ACA repeal isn't there. It's popular. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2535.0s)]
*  It's like 60% approval. It's the most popular it's ever been. Only 38% of people disapproved. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2540.6800000000003s)]
*  The appetite isn't there in Congress either. I do worry about Medicaid a lot because I think [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2545.56s)]
*  he can, Republicans will want to gut Medicaid as part of the budget bill they're going to use [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2552.84s)]
*  to extend the Trump tax cuts. So I think we should watch that. Obviously Biden did the inflation [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2558.6s)]
*  reduction act as part of a budget reconciliation bill. We talked about that more than enough when [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2565.08s)]
*  it was happening, but I think Republicans are going to now do something similar with the budget bill [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2570.52s)]
*  and they're going to try to do tax cuts and then all of their other cuts to the budget. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2574.36s)]
*  And I worry about healthcare programs that can be just, you know, cut or radically reduced just in [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2578.2799999999997s)]
*  the budget. I don't think they're going to have the votes to actually repeal the insurance [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2584.52s)]
*  protections or the law of the Affordable Care Act. But I think a lot of the money that goes to making [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2588.6s)]
*  healthcare affordable for people, I really do worry about that. Right. The places where they'll look [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2594.12s)]
*  to make cuts that they think they can get away with will be Medicaid and will be food stamps. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2598.2s)]
*  They will go after the programs that target the poor, especially because in this interview and [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2603.48s)]
*  previously Trump has said that he wants to carve out Social Security and Medicare. He knows [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2607.4s)]
*  politically it's toxic. And so where are you going to get the money to pay for a $200,000 tax cut [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2612.92s)]
*  for a person making $5 million? You're going to cut food stamp increases by $20 a month. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2617.08s)]
*  Yeah. And the Doge bozos like Elon and Vivek are like learning in real time on Twitter that most [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2621.8s)]
*  of US spending, federal spending is entitlement programs like Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2627.0s)]
*  And they're like, amazing. Look at this. Quote tweet. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2631.48s)]
*  It drives me fucking nuts. It is like, Hey, did you guys all hear about this? [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2634.3599999999997s)]
*  The Elon posting, you know, I'm posting something like we're paying so much for [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2639.48s)]
*  healthcare, but we're not really getting a good value for it. Like you fucking suck. We've been [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2642.9199999999996s)]
*  dealing with this. This is a talking about this for fucking 20 years. Good thing. A brilliant man [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2646.12s)]
*  like me has looked into this. You guys know that no one has done that before. You know, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2650.52s)]
*  the administrative costs on private insurance versus Medicare. It's out of control. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2654.8399999999997s)]
*  Brief exchange about abortion. Welker asked if he would be restricting access to abortion [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2659.7999999999997s)]
*  pills and he made it seem like he would not. I think the question is like, does he come under [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2663.16s)]
*  more pressure from Republicans in Congress now that they have a majority in both houses to do [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2668.2799999999997s)]
*  more on abortion than he might be inclined to do or, you know, she asked the question about the [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2674.12s)]
*  abortion pill. That would be an administrative action. Does some of the loons he has put in [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2679.0s)]
*  charge of his government decide to move on that? That's the big question. I think clearly Republicans [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2683.7999999999997s)]
*  want a national abortion ban. This is part of their project. There are a bunch of right wing [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2689.16s)]
*  zealots in the house in particular who will stop at nothing to get a federal abortion ban. The [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2693.0s)]
*  question is whether speaker Johnson will keep those people under wraps if he and Trump have cut [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2699.0s)]
*  some sort of deal. I don't. Yeah, I think that the votes aren't there in the house. The Republicans [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2704.8399999999997s)]
*  don't have a big enough majority and the frontline members are not in districts where they are going [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2710.04s)]
*  to especially since the frontline members are a lot of them blue state Republicans. They're not [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2715.16s)]
*  going to want to do that. I think it's not the appetite's not there among some enough Republican [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2720.52s)]
*  senators to do that. They're not going to vote in the Senate either. I worry about, you know, the [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2724.68s)]
*  Comstock Act and what happens in the within the administration. Yeah, the question is always on [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2728.8399999999997s)]
*  abortion with Trump has been not what does he want to do, but what is he willing to stop? That's why [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2733.48s)]
*  the most important question during the election was would you veto a bill? That's why the questions [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2737.48s)]
*  around what he would do administratively are so important and he has evaded those answers. I think [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2742.28s)]
*  he clearly understands how damaging politically this has been for him and does not want the fight, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2747.4s)]
*  but a lot of people around him do. All right, let's talk about the vaccines. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2753.0800000000004s)]
*  All over the place there. He says that Kennedy won't be upending the system. That's that was. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2758.28s)]
*  Yeah, but if you watch or read through, it's also pretty clear he's bought into the idea that there [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2763.1600000000003s)]
*  there's been a huge spike in autism in America and that it has has to be attributable to something [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2767.32s)]
*  external, maybe vaccines. Who knows? Let's investigate. He also mentions at one point that [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2771.88s)]
*  it could be chlorine in the water, presumably meaning fluoride, which we know RFK wants to get [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2777.48s)]
*  rid of. Oh, that's what he meant. Yeah. Okay. That's that's what he meant. Got it. Cool. Anything [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2783.2400000000002s)]
*  we are worried about public pools. I don't know. I took it to mean fluoride. Yeah. It seems the [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2787.96s)]
*  danger to me seems again that like Trump is at risk of just getting convinced by RFK Jr. to make [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2794.76s)]
*  these major public health changes. And by the way, if RFK goes off on his own and does some [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2801.4s)]
*  investigation, it's just an investigation. Like, oh, I wonder what's going to turn up. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2805.96s)]
*  You know, this is the problem. RFK. This is what he cares about. This is the only thing he cares [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2810.28s)]
*  about. In 2021, he did a podcast interview where he said he goes hiking. If he sees a parent [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2814.12s)]
*  carrying a little baby, he'll say to them, better not get him vaccinated. Like literally, like he [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2818.28s)]
*  says strangers on the hiking trail. He said this. So that is not a nuanced perspective that includes [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2822.84s)]
*  a carve out for polio. This is a an ideologue who is dishonest, who is sloppy. And if he gets [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2829.64s)]
*  access to a big bunch of data, he's going to find what he wants to find. And in the process, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2835.96s)]
*  I don't know where Trump will land on all this, but in the process, the US government [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2841.0s)]
*  showing chaos and making people hesitant or scared to get vaccines like that is going to do damage. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2846.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's like to me, that's like the best case scenario is a huge fight over vaccines and whether [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2852.3599999999997s)]
*  RFK's bullshit study is right or wrong. You could get a whole bunch of people in HHS, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2860.04s)]
*  who whistleblowers saying, no, this is bullshippable. But if there is, if there is conflict [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2864.3599999999997s)]
*  about it, that is going to increase hesitancy. That's going to do damage enough. Yeah, I think [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2869.16s)]
*  RFK Jr. coming out and trying to withdraw vaccine approvals, causing a kind of giant national [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2873.0s)]
*  debate over this. Like, do I do I think that's necessarily going to happen? No, I worry about [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2880.8399999999997s)]
*  the kind of quiet power this guy's going to have behind the scenes to decide what gets funded, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2886.36s)]
*  what doesn't get funded, who's in charge of overseeing these investigations. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2891.1600000000003s)]
*  For a long time on abortion, the question was, would the court overturn Roe v. Wade? And what [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2901.96s)]
*  they did was the headlines would end up being court upholds Roe v. Wade while undermining abortion [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2907.2400000000002s)]
*  all along the way. And I worry about what happens when you have somebody like RFK Jr. in charge of [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2913.16s)]
*  the Department of Health and Human Services and it comes out, RFK Jr. will not be banning vaccines. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2917.08s)]
*  But the policies that are now coming down from the top throughout HHS are undermining vaccination [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2922.3599999999997s)]
*  campaigns, undermining public health research, undermining the institutions that are not just [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2927.3199999999997s)]
*  making sure people are getting vaccinated now, but investigating and doing the research into the next [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2934.2s)]
*  generation of vaccines. Like, I'm worried about the like what happens when the headlines fade [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2937.7999999999997s)]
*  because he's not doing the big, terrible thing and we just live with the slow degradation of what is [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2942.12s)]
*  the incredible public health apparatus, like the incredible achievements of America's public health [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2947.7999999999997s)]
*  system. Yeah, I think he's going to do both. I mean, he's already said, I mean, there's some [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2954.2799999999997s)]
*  quote out there we said, I'm going to tell the researchers that we're going to hit pause for [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2957.48s)]
*  eight years on basically R&D on some of these vaccines and things. But what always happens [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2961.88s)]
*  with these anti-vax advocates is they get a mound of data and they find in what they want. And then [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2966.12s)]
*  the scientists on the other side are left having conversations about correlation, not causation, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2971.4s)]
*  and other variables and the uncertainty of the scientific process and yada yada yada. And we [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2977.08s)]
*  just lose that public debate. And in the process, a bunch of parents are like, I don't know, man, [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2981.8s)]
*  this measles thing is scary. And what to do. I heard this story. I read something online. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2985.8s)]
*  There's this awful example of a child who got the shots and then all of a sudden wasn't responsive. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2990.2000000000003s)]
*  And that stuff is really powerful. Yeah. Next thing you know, they take away your diet coke. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=2995.96s)]
*  He's not stupid enough to go after my and Donald Trump's diet coke. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3001.48s)]
*  I know. That's where he draws the line. Foreign policy was not a major focus of the Meet the [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3004.36s)]
*  Press interview, which Trump recorded on Friday morning, two days before Assad's regime fell in [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3009.0s)]
*  Syria. Though the issue did come up when Welker asked about Tulsi Gabbard's nomination to be [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3014.52s)]
*  director of national intelligence. Gabbard had a couple of infamous secret meetings with Assad [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3019.4s)]
*  that reportedly have a bunch of senators worried about her nomination with good reason. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3024.52s)]
*  Let's listen to Trump's response. Let me ask you about former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3029.64s)]
*  You picked her to be the director of national intelligence. In 2017, she had two secret [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3033.72s)]
*  meetings with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. Do you have questions or concerns about those meetings? [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3038.6s)]
*  No. And he's got bigger problems right now. Do you think it makes it hard for her? [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3043.96s)]
*  Because his country is collapsing. Yeah. I mean, do you think it compromises her [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3047.96s)]
*  going to handle that? I met with Putin. I met with President Xi of China. I met with Kim Jong-un [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3050.76s)]
*  twice. Does that mean that I can't be president? Well, when you were president, they weren't [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3055.56s)]
*  secret meetings. Do you have confidence in Tulsi Gabbard? I do. I mean, she's a very respected [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3058.84s)]
*  person. Before we get into the politics of it, Tommy, can you just walk everyone through [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3064.92s)]
*  what actually happened this weekend since this is now the biggest story in the world? I know [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3069.08s)]
*  you and Ben did a bonus episode about this for Pod Save the World that everyone should check out. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3073.08s)]
*  We recorded something Sunday. We'll do another one on Tuesday for Wednesday, but check them out [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3077.96s)]
*  if you want the longer story. I mean, the short answer is that in Syria, these opposition forces [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3081.4s)]
*  toppled 50 years of Assad rule and 13 years of the Civil War, and they just drove them out of town. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3086.44s)]
*  It was lightning speed. The rebels basically started coming south from northwestern Syria, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3092.44s)]
*  and over the course of eight days took city after city after city until they just rolled into [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3100.36s)]
*  Damascus, and Assad had to fly to Russia, where he will now live out the rest of his life, [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3104.28s)]
*  hopefully in some squalid conditions. So it's just a truly historic moment where one of the most [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3110.3599999999997s)]
*  brutal regimes in modern history fell, and Bashar al-Assad came after his father, who was just as [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3117.16s)]
*  brutal and took power in a coup, and Bashar killed 500,000 of his own people through the course of [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3125.4s)]
*  the Civil War. He was just a truly horrific human being. Sounds like when push came to shove, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3133.7999999999997s)]
*  Iran and Russia really weren't there for their pals in Syria. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3137.88s)]
*  Yeah, they were not there. They were either tied up in Ukraine or tied up in Lebanon, [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3141.32s)]
*  or Hezbollah had been decapitated by the Israelis, so his benefactors were not around to bail him out [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3146.92s)]
*  this time. Well, then let's talk about his other friend, Tulsi Gabbard. What do you think this [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3152.6800000000003s)]
*  means for Gabbard's nomination? Anything? I mean, that's a good question. So the kind of [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3158.6800000000003s)]
*  hit list on her, they mentioned it there. She met with Assad twice. She flew to Syria to meet with [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3163.48s)]
*  him in 2017, then she got this kind of PR tour around Aleppo after it had been bombed to dust [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3168.76s)]
*  by Assad and the Russians. She said Assad is not the enemy of the United States. She refused to say [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3174.44s)]
*  Assad is a war criminal. She also refuses to believe that Assad used chemical weapons on his [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3180.04s)]
*  own people, which he very much did. And so there's all these other weird examples. In 2018, the House [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3184.2s)]
*  Foreign Affairs Committee held a closed-door meeting with a Syrian defector who had smuggled [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3190.28s)]
*  all this evidence of Assad's brutality and war crimes out of Syria. And bipartisan groups of [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3194.1200000000003s)]
*  staffers were so worried about Tulsi being there that the guy wore a mask in closed-door hearings. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3199.96s)]
*  And then there's this, that same NBC report that talks about that, mentioned a trip Tulsi took to [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3205.7200000000003s)]
*  the Turkey-Syria border in 2015. There she met with two little girls who had been horrifically [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3211.32s)]
*  burned from airstrikes while they were living at this IDP camp. And she asked them, [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3217.3199999999997s)]
*  how do you know it was the Russians and Assad who bombed you and not ISIS? And the answer is, [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3222.8399999999997s)]
*  ISIS doesn't have an air force, you fucking moron. So it's like, are you, are you an Assad fan? [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3228.3599999999997s)]
*  Are you just that stupid? You know what I mean? Like, how do you get to these- [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3235.08s)]
*  Neither speaks very well for qualifications for DNI. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3238.2799999999997s)]
*  No. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3241.64s)]
*  Yeah, there's also the, she embraced the conspiracy theory around biolabs in Ukraine. And like, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3243.1s)]
*  you know, this has become like ideological and because like, and John Bolton has been one of [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3249.5s)]
*  like the most like fervent opponents. But the point he made, which is this like, this isn't, [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3253.2599999999998s)]
*  she just seems like she has terrible judgment. Like it's not ideological. She's a fucking kook. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3258.94s)]
*  And like whether or not the fact that she was so solicitous towards Assad and like the specific [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3263.02s)]
*  situation in Syria aside, like the fact that all this is unfolding as she's about to go into these [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3274.38s)]
*  hearings is a reminder that like, this is a serious and important job. Like the, the, like Trump, [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3279.66s)]
*  one part in the Welker interview, Welker says, you know, you said you would end the war in one day [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3285.5s)]
*  if you were president. So how's that going? And it is like, to me, like it is a, the Hegseth stuff, [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3291.18s)]
*  that Gabbard stuff, it's a reminder to me, like Trump has won twice as a challenger. He has lost [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3297.4199999999996s)]
*  as an incumbent. It is easy to say how, how, how you will solve every problem and understand how [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3304.8599999999997s)]
*  to turn every key when you are a candidate. But when you were president, these are serious, real [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3310.22s)]
*  and complicated issues that demand serious capable people. And Tulsi Gabbard, Pete Hegseth, [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3314.8599999999997s)]
*  these are not those people. Yeah, you need a team. And like I get where Tulsi is coming from on [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3320.78s)]
*  not saying Assad is not the enemy of the United States. She's just trying to make an argument [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3324.78s)]
*  that we shouldn't go to war in Syria or on behalf of the Syrian opposition. I understand that. But [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3328.3s)]
*  in service of that goal, she became an apologist for this evil war criminal who was using, you [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3333.7400000000002s)]
*  know, chemical weapons on his own people, who was throwing people in these gulags and torturing them [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3339.34s)]
*  for years and years and years. And so, you know, there's gonna be the Gabbard hearing, but then [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3343.7400000000002s)]
*  there's gonna be a set of policy questions for Trump. There's 900 US troops sitting in Syria [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3347.42s)]
*  right now working with these Kurdish forces to keep ISIS at bay. There's Syrian chemical weapons [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3352.78s)]
*  stockpiles that are kind of littered throughout the country still. These Israelis were bombing [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3357.5s)]
*  those over the weekend. CENTCOM was hitting all these ISIS targets. There's gonna be this need to [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3361.34s)]
*  make sure that this isn't just chapter one of the Syrian civil war and that something good comes out [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3367.26s)]
*  of it, some sort of viable state, because the Syrian civil war led to five million people, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3372.54s)]
*  I think, fleeing beyond Syria who are living as refugees. Most of them are in the sort of [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3378.7799999999997s)]
*  neighboring countries like Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon, et cetera. But, you know, I think Germany took, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3383.42s)]
*  like, 800,000 refugees in. A lot of those people want to go home. A lot of that migration [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3388.7799999999997s)]
*  destabilized the politics in these European countries and led to the rise of these far-right [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3394.46s)]
*  parties. So there's a huge opportunity right now for the international community to step up, [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3398.94s)]
*  help Syria, help people come home and make it a viable state and not let it devolve into just [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3403.66s)]
*  another fucking nightmare for these people who have lived through hell for the last decade. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3409.18s)]
*  And the question is, what is Trump gonna do? Because his tweet is like, not our problem. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3413.7400000000002s)]
*  That's his take. And then his DNI is like an Assad fan. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3417.98s)]
*  And then you have Rubio, who's been a hawk. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3420.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3422.78s)]
*  It's just like the contradictions get resolved when you're governing. They can exist while [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3423.02s)]
*  you're campaigning. They don't get to continue to exist when you're governing. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3426.94s)]
*  Yeah. Did you see in Playbook Today, they were reporting that, you know, [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3429.26s)]
*  Gabbard's defenders now are gonna say, well, she once called him a brutal dictator. And also, [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3434.54s)]
*  she has top-secret clearance. So if there was any problem, this would have come up then. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3441.5s)]
*  That process is always perfect. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3445.98s)]
*  Right. And then she was just promoted also to be a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve. So [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3447.98s)]
*  all of this stuff is like qualifications for that. But I'm like, I don't... [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3453.9s)]
*  The Army Reserve process probably isn't geared to look into international fucking trips to meet [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3457.1800000000003s)]
*  with Assad. I'm sure she did what she needed to do to earn that promotion, but it's a ridiculous [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3461.98s)]
*  defense. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3466.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. The Air Force reservist named Jack DeShera was the kid who leaked all those top-secret [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3466.94s)]
*  documents onto Discord to his gamer buddies. So I don't know that that's the bar we're gonna hold [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3471.98s)]
*  the DNI to. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3476.2200000000003s)]
*  Seems wise. Okay. Before we go, if anyone's looking for a last-minute stocking stuffer, [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3477.9s)]
*  we do have a gift for you. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3482.46s)]
*  My new Trump fragrances are here. They make a great Christmas present. I've named them [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3483.74s)]
*  Fight Fight Fight because they represent winning. We all want to be winning. We have to win as a [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3489.3399999999997s)]
*  nation. We want to win as a family. This fragrance is all about strength and success and confidence [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3494.8599999999997s)]
*  for men and for women. Get yourself a bottle and don't forget to grab one for your loved ones, too. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3500.62s)]
*  They'll thank you and they'll even smell good. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3506.8599999999997s)]
*  It's not real. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3511.74s)]
*  I hadn't listened to the end. You even smell good. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3512.54s)]
*  Hey, did a raccoon with Axe body spray wander into McDonald's? No, no, that's my new cologne. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3515.02s)]
*  That's my new cologne. It's Fight Fight Fight. I'm wearing my Donald Trump scented cologne. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3521.58s)]
*  It's Fight Fight Fight. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3526.06s)]
*  Donald Trump was in Paris this weekend at the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3528.46s)]
*  The First Lady was there. Jill Biden. Apparently they were sitting near each other. They spoke. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3533.9s)]
*  It was a pleasant exchange. There's a picture of Trump talking to Jill Biden where she's smiling. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3538.14s)]
*  Trump posted that picture with a caption that said, [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3543.9s)]
*  A fragrance your enemies can't resist. Used as an ad for Fight Fight Fight. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3550.86s)]
*  Look, I think the fucking liberal media is going to phase it. Jill Biden wants to fuck Donald Trump. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3555.42s)]
*  That's in Notre Dame Cathedral in a holy fucking place. That's what the news will fucking cover it. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3561.02s)]
*  The news won't talk about it. The news won't talk about it. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3567.9s)]
*  It will say there's a lot of laughter from the coach. Farah's draw dropped. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3571.26s)]
*  He kept rolling out these products during the campaign and I was like, [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3579.82s)]
*  maybe he thinks he's going to lose and he's just getting like one last grift in, [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3582.38s)]
*  but now he's president and he's rolling out a fragrance? [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3585.26s)]
*  Come on, man. You have so many avenues for corruption. You're going to be just fine. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3588.54s)]
*  You don't need a fragrance. I always want more. I always want more. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3592.54s)]
*  Get the crypto. It's called Fight Fight Fight because it represents winning. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3596.14s)]
*  That just doesn't make a lot of sense. You got to smell it. Listen, there's one thing. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3601.1s)]
*  Smell like a winner. That would have been a better tagline. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3605.5s)]
*  Trump fragrance. Smell like a winner. You got to go in the store and smell the fragrances. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3610.7799999999997s)]
*  You got to trust it based on a brand. It could smell like anything. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3614.7799999999997s)]
*  There needs to be some place to buy this stuff where the money doesn't go to him, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3618.14s)]
*  like a secondary sale, you know, kind of used fragrance store. I don't want to give him money. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3622.46s)]
*  That's our show for today. If you have smelled Fight Fight Fight Cologne, [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3633.82s)]
*  please let us know what it smells like. If you bought it, sell to me. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3638.54s)]
*  Yeah. And if anyone's looking for a present for me, you know what to get me. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3641.66s)]
*  That's our show for today. We'll be back with a new show on Wednesday. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9-99KU9mQ0&t=3645.66s)]
