Video Description: Kamala Harris fulfills her oath of office, certifying the election results on the four-year anniversary of the January 6th Capitol riot. Meanwhile, Republicans strategize about passing Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” jammed full of MAGA hopes and dreams. Jon, Lovett, and Tommy discuss why simply remembering January 6th isn’t enough, and how Democrats should respond to Republicans’ tax cutting agenda. Plus, MAGA-world did what all of us do over the holidays: squabble with our relatives — this time over immigration policy and H-1B visas. Finally, Joe Biden awards the Presidential Medal of Freedom… and the guys don’t get one.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

*  Good to see you guys. You too. You too. Miss this place [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=4.42s)]
*  Quick announcement before we start now that the elections over we're going back to two episodes per week [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=8.82s)]
*  Tuesdays and Fridays [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=13.84s)]
*  Maybe the occasional episode on the weekends more news on that after the inauguration. We heard you loud and clear do less [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=15.6s)]
*  But for now it'll be the three of us on Tuesdays as it was [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=23.54s)]
*  Dan and I on Fridays and you know less chaos for all of us on Wednesdays. Yeah, so that's that on today's show [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=26.84s)]
*  We're gonna talk about how Republicans are gearing up to pass what Trump is calling one big beautiful bill [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=33.32s)]
*  That'll fulfill his campaign promises on taxes energy and immigration. We're also gonna talk about President Biden's final list of Medal of Freedom recipients [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=37.76s)]
*  Which was criticized by Republicans including incoming vice president JD Vance [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=45.0s)]
*  But first we're recording this on January 6th a day four years ago when Donald Trump incited a violent mob of his supporters to [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=49.28s)]
*  storm the US Capitol assault police officers and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=56.44s)]

*  And this time the only clash outside the Capitol was a snowball fight. I look fun. Yeah, I did look fun [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=70.84s)]
*  More fun than four years ago. It took Congress about 30 minutes to certify the election [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=76.76s)]
*  No one objected and the final results were even read by Trump's opponent Kamala [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=80.84s)]
*  Harris who is vice president was obligated by the Constitution to suffer this final indignity [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=84.94s)]

*  talking to reporters [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=146.44s)]
*  Was about what should be the norm and what the American people should be able to take for granted today [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=152.88s)]
*  I did what I have done my entire career [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=158.94s)]
*  Which is take seriously the oath that I have taken many times to support and defend the Constitution of the United States [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=161.28s)]
*  Welcome back to hell everyone [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=168.92s)]
*  Jesus [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=171.16s)]
*  The current president Joe Biden he weighed in on January 6th with a Washington Post op-ed as one does [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=172.51999999999998s)]
*  Where he calls out the quote unrelenting effort to quote rewrite even a race the history of January 6th and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=179.64s)]
*  Implores us to commit to remembering January 6th every year because quote any nation that forgets its past is doomed to repeat it [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=186.12s)]
*  Feels like the horse is out of the barn on that one [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=193.76s)]
*  But what do you guys think how was the country supposed to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=196.28s)]
*  process the reality that Trump's actions on January 6th just [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=200.12s)]
*  Weren't enough of a problem for most Americans to keep him out of the White House [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=205.0s)]
*  Don't you guys feel like an op-ed about January 6th is just the perfect encapsulation of how feckless everything feels in this moment [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  Yes, yes [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=217.2s)]
*  So I this has bothered me for a while. It just tells me for a second the quote [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=220.0s)]
*  Is those who do not remember the past are doomed to repeat it? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=225.55999999999997s)]
*  But it's not about countries [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=229.39999999999998s)]
*  It's about people and the actual quote if you go back and look at it is not about like the magical ability [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=230.83999999999997s)]
*  To remember things like memories do not prevent insurrections [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=236.32s)]
*  Like that's not what the quotes about what the quotes actually about is if you don't remember anything [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=239.64s)]
*  You're doomed to do the same thing over and over again [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  But if you're too mired in the past right if you become a this is the from the original philosopher [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  stubborn like an old man [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=251.76s)]
*  You also become doomed to repeat yourself because you're not adaptable [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=253.72s)]
*  And you don't learn from what's happening in the actual present and so like that's pretty on the nose [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=258.04s)]
*  Yeah, it is pretty on the nose Tommy at least he got a he gives you a placement in the post [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=263.16s)]
*  You know with Bezos owning it. Yeah, well good for you. You have to start by [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=268.04s)]
*  Tunis speaking of coups, you know first couple of paragraphs are about how Milani is looking more and more beautiful [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=272.56s)]
*  I [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=278.08s)]
*  Have to say that I was handling the election results pretty well and did a good job [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=279.52s)]
*  Disconnecting from the news over the break and it wasn't it's I thought okay, January 6 gonna be our first pod [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=284.96s)]
*  Like we should say something about January 6 because whatever it's the anniversary when I started reading last night [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=291.4s)]
*  And then this morning I got so angry. Oh, it's really started to hit. It's awful [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=296.76s)]
*  It's really hard to hit me in a way that I was not [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=301.35999999999996s)]
*  Was not expecting just one wouldn't happen. You just wanted by a bigger margin before you will now take office with both [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=304.06s)]
*  Congress in a court system that he stacked for himself a few years ago [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=309.84s)]
*  So yeah, when we when it comes to fighting back his agenda in Washington [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=313.56s)]
*  We are a bunch of we our party is one sad op-ed. We'll be doing messaging until the midterms [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=318.0s)]
*  It's uh, you know, we are both remembering and repeating the past seems this week. I mean a coup attempt [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=323.78s)]
*  Wasn't disqualifying and and no amount of remembering is gonna change that right, you know [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=331.35999999999996s)]
*  It's like look Biden in Congress to their credit [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=336.4s)]
*  Republicans and Democrats passed a bill to make it more difficult to overturn the results of future elections on January 6th in the certification process [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=339.28s)]
*  You know, they can beef up security, but there's just there's just no getting around the fact that [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=346.21999999999997s)]
*  Americans most Americans used a free and fair election to [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=350.96s)]
*  Say that they're okay with the president who tried to overturn a free and fair election [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=355.48s)]
*  Like we're just we all have to live with that [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=359.6s)]
*  Yeah, and I also for all of history and that's what I think is so like [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=361.2s)]
*  And by the way, like I know I'm just like hey, we're back to new year time to criticize Joe Biden again [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=364.96000000000004s)]
*  It's like you're right. Like if we don't learn from the past we are doomed to repeat it [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=370.72s)]
*  but one of the things we should learn from the recent past is [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=374.40000000000003s)]
*  Democrats performing virtue [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=377.72s)]
*  Explaining over and over again why the insurrection was so terrible [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=380.2s)]
*  It didn't work like this style of politics is not working and like we should also probably remember the recent past ourselves [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=383.04s)]
*  yeah, it's not a remembering problem, it's a caring problem and [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=389.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's right of that [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=392.76s)]
*  We can we don't need to relitigate the whole election [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=394.92s)]
*  obviously like inflation was a big part of it and people how they were feeling economically, but a [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=397.12s)]
*  Majority of voters just decided that they were okay voting for the guy who did the insurrection and some of that is [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=402.52s)]
*  propaganda in the power [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=408.12s)]
*  Of autocrats like Donald Trump when you have this media apparatus on the right to rewrite history, right? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=410.32s)]
*  I mean it was not long after the insurrection that people like Tucker Carlson were leading the charge and [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=415.52s)]
*  Suggesting that it was like an FBI op and a false flag operation yada yada yada [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=421.24s)]
*  But most of it was just people didn't care and it's a really sad story also about tribalism in [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=425.6s)]
*  The fact that a lot of Trump fans from the people who stormed the Capitol to his new billionaire buddies in the tech industry [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=431.52000000000004s)]
*  Just don't care. They hate Democrats more than they care about what he tried to do to [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=439.0s)]
*  Democratic institutions to your point about how it like sounds the same [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=445.72s)]
*  It's like the same tone from Democrats. The problem for me is not necessarily like saying again what happened on January 6th [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=449.0s)]
*  I wouldn't mind that actually because I do think like I mean I read at sergeant Ganel who was one of the police officers who was [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=455.4s)]
*  Assaulted on that day. He was writing in the bulwark on Monday and [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=463.44s)]
*  This guy was served in Iraq for over 500 days. He said that of all those days [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=467.72s)]
*  January 6th was the scariest day of his life even [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=473.92s)]
*  Considering like he was in harm's way in Iraq came back with PTSD [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=476.8s)]
*  He was assaulted more than 40 times that day lost his job afterwards couldn't lost his health and [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=479.68s)]
*  Reading that got me like really really angry because at least it was like it puts you back in that day that what I couldn't handle [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=487.44s)]
*  on January 6th was like all of the talk about the institutions in our democracy and like isn't it great that [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=495.52000000000004s)]
*  Democrats know how to do the peaceful transfer of power and like look at Kamala Harris [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=502.2s)]
*  Just isn't a terrible position on January 6th [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=507.32s)]
*  Like I really feel for her so I don't want to criticize her for her comments much [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=509.88s)]
*  But like Biden's op-ed did not say anything most Democrats were like this is what it's basically like [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=513.42s)]
*  This is what it looks like to lose like us like not be sore losers. Yes [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=518.72s)]
*  Good losers. That's what we are now and look you could have easily said [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=523.84s)]
*  Donald Trump incited an insurrection and [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=529.24s)]
*  And this he's tried to lie about he's right to rate history. He's wrong. He's unfit [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=532.48s)]
*  The American people disagree with my assessment and other people's assessment, but I don't have to pretend that everything's okay [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=537.6800000000001s)]
*  You know like you can still accept the result without sounding like [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=543.32s)]
*  Pat me pat myself on the back because I've defended institutions [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=547.2800000000001s)]
*  That's the thing that's what was so like like the op-ed by Joe Biden does not mention Donald Trump by name [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=550.12s)]
*  And and I understand the logic of that which is like you're trying to I don't know perform [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=555.32s)]
*  That you're performing normalcy to I don't know. Hope Donald Trump learns from your example [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=561.84s)]
*  It doesn't like but but it's proved it's privileging normal behave normal looking behavior over being honest about the situation [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=567.2800000000001s)]
*  Which is you are handing over power to someone who has promised to use the pardon power and the powers of [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=574.6400000000001s)]
*  The Justice Department [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=581.6800000000001s)]
*  Against his enemies in terrifying ways you are doing that that is what you believe is your responsibility [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=583.12s)]
*  But you're not being honest about it. You're you saying this op-ed [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=588.0s)]
*  We cannot accept a repeat of what happened four years ago [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=591.24s)]
*  But just in how you're talking about this right now you're accepting it [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=594.24s)]
*  Well, he says like, you know and on that day democracy prevailed and it's like yeah, maybe on that day [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=596.64s)]
*  But like guess what today feels like the coup worked [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=600.76s)]
*  Yeah, and you know it took longer than Donald Trump expected but it worked [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=603.32s)]
*  I had similar mixed feelings like I appreciate them modeling adult leadership and respect for [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=606.4s)]
*  Institutions and democracy and the peaceful transfer of power [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=611.48s)]
*  It is what makes the United States special [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=613.84s)]
*  But it also it did make me very frustrated at Joe Biden all over again for running for reelection in part because there were all [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=615.48s)]
*  These stories over the break about Biden and his like closest closest aides telling people that they think he would have won and it's like [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=622.4s)]
*  Boy talk about [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=629.12s)]
*  doomed to repeating mistakes if we don't learn from them, right like that is delusional and [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=630.52s)]
*  Anyone entertaining that kind of delusional thinking is is doing Biden in the Democratic Party a disservice [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=635.88s)]
*  Yeah, and again, it's just it's the the tone and you know [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=642.44s)]
*  I thought that now we and others have talked too much about the whole made the whole point about like Democrats just can't be the [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=645.72s)]
*  Defenders of institutions. We got to reform institutions. I was like, alright, we've we've made our we've set our piece on that [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=651.24s)]
*  But then today and I get it's January 6th and it's about democracy [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=656.32s)]
*  Whatever so people talking about it, but like just the the language there is like an entire language [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=659.6s)]
*  The Democrats need to just fucking throw in the trash [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=664.3599999999999s)]
*  About like institutions democracy sacred this and blah blah blah blah blah. It's like no [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=667.5999999999999s)]
*  It's so like okay Joe Biden. I've read your op-ed. I've gotten to the bon of it. I agree. I'm doing it right now [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=673.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm remembering January 6 here. I am I'm remembering it. There's no next step [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=678.76s)]
*  There's no next step for what you do to actually prevent an insurrection or to prevent an overthrow of our democracy [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=683.56s)]
*  There's no there's there's just there's no kind of I don't know like sense of agency. We're just passengers [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=689.6999999999999s)]
*  That's good luck for four years [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=695.5799999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=696.6999999999999s)]
*  or like just attunement with the [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=697.18s)]
*  Millions of people in the country who were probably wrestling with this [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=700.5799999999999s)]
*  Like we are like other people are and who just can't believe this is about to happen like no acknowledgement that people are [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=704.18s)]
*  Angry just in despair to you know, it's just it's just sort of like riding up here [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=710.62s)]
*  Yeah, you know like a level with lash from the campaign messaging. Yes, exactly [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=714.8199999999999s)]
*  So more than 1,500 people have been charged with crimes related to January 6th more than 170 who've been accused of using weapons [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=719.62s)]
*  to assault police officers [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=726.5799999999999s)]
*  170 more than a thousand have pleaded guilty more than 200 were convicted a trial [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=728.74s)]
*  The Department of Justice is still weighing whether to charge hundreds more [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=733.6999999999999s)]
*  But of course Trump has promised to pardon these fine Americans on day one [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=737.18s)]
*  Though he has said he said to time in late November. I'm going to do case by case and if they were nonviolent [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=741.54s)]
*  I think they've been greatly punished so unclear what he's actually gonna do here [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=746.82s)]
*  He certainly has the power to pardon any or all of the rioters even the violent ones though if he does [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=750.34s)]
*  I think it certainly comes with some pretty scary implications [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=755.82s)]
*  Going forward. What do you guys think? Are we supposed to just sort of accept that most Americans didn't care enough about this? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=760.62s)]
*  No, I think I think this is very politically precarious for Trump no matter what he does [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=766.2s)]
*  Because people may have forgotten about [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=771.86s)]
*  January 6 or they just stopped caring about it, but it doesn't mean they agree with him [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=774.26s)]
*  I think the Washington Post had some polling on the around the three-year anniversary [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=778.08s)]
*  They'd found people thought it was an attack on democracy not you know a peaceful protest or whatever Trump's narrative was [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=781.46s)]
*  So I think if he if Trump pardons violent offenders from that day [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=788.38s)]
*  We need to lift those stories up as much as possible [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=793.24s)]
*  especially the specific stories of you know a cop who got beat up or this or that right because [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=795.22s)]
*  The horror of the day can get lost in kind of the collective way we talk about January 6 [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=800.36s)]
*  Like it was one singular event actually was like a whole bunch of awful things that happened to thousands and thousands of people [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=805.12s)]
*  Who stormed and rampaged through the Capitol so lifting up those individual stories is important [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=810.5600000000001s)]
*  But if Trump doesn't pardon all of these violent offenders like that the former head of the proud boys is out there today [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=814.4200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, demanding a pardon and we get terrio [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=820.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=822.96s)]
*  If Trump doesn't pardon guys like him [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=823.32s)]
*  Then he's gonna have a whole bunch of rip shit MAGA types [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=826.3399999999999s)]
*  And I think that's valuable because we want to fracture the MAGA coalition [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=829.1999999999999s)]
*  So I think this is a pretty precarious moment for him. It's like a real put up or shut up moment [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=833.0999999999999s)]
*  No, I agree with that. You know, it's [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=837.5999999999999s)]
*  like [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=840.02s)]
*  In the same way that like we talked about like how to remember when like whenever North Korea would test a nuclear missile [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=841.3s)]
*  The State Department would say well, this is unacceptable. I'm so okay seems like then what you've accepted it. It's accepted [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=847.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and so it's like are we just gonna accept that that that all of these people that that that we're just gonna accept that [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=854.34s)]
*  The country's just gonna move on from the insurrection. Well, like yes, it's true. That's what's happened [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=861.9s)]
*  But the question is what do we do and also like again? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=866.5s)]
*  Like how do we learn from the fact that this wasn't salient enough? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=869.9s)]
*  Important enough for people enough people as they voted to make the difference why right? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=873.94s)]
*  Some of it is just time right like some of the most right-wing Republicans [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=878.82s)]
*  Thought Trump was finished after January 6 not just the like establishment types [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=882.92s)]
*  But like real right-wing Republicans thought he was doing so much damage to himself and to the conservative cause that he had to be [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=888.16s)]
*  Pushed aside now Charlie Kirk right after the insurrection said enjoy jail up to all the writers like enjoy jail [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=893.92s)]
*  Yeah, let's get him. Let's put him in jail [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=901.06s)]
*  And so like over the years that followed there was this [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=903.16s)]
*  slow [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=906.96s)]
*  deliberate effort to [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=908.52s)]
*  Keep moving the kind of [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=910.84s)]
*  politics on this from [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=913.48s)]
*  Donald Trump is finished to [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=915.52s)]
*  This wasn't led by Donald Trump to this was a false flag operation led by the FBI now [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=917.92s)]
*  We're at the point where these are political prisoners and actually nothing they didn't do anything wrong that they that that [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=923.1999999999999s)]
*  That that Donald Trump won the election right and like I do think it's worth thinking. Okay. Well, what's next after that, right? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=930.0s)]
*  Well, I do think [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=935.16s)]
*  Part of what I hope we can do and Democrats should do in the coming years is like [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=937.4399999999999s)]
*  Tell people why they should care about something that happens instead of just being outraged about it [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=942.48s)]
*  Yeah, and you know Matt Iglesias in his substance a little boring today talked about how he's more alarmed today than he was on [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=947.0799999999999s)]
*  January 6 2021 [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=955.0s)]
*  Because at least then you know all those Republicans you just talked about came out and it seemed like it was over for Donald Trump [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=957.24s)]
*  and that was it and you know, it was and [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=962.92s)]
*  Thinking about the pardon power here which man pardons over the last month my views on the pardon power [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=965.92s)]
*  Like I always thought it was sort of expansive and dangerous now. I'm really like this is a real [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=972.52s)]
*  Iglesias talks about how it's like potentially a backdoor to dictatorship, right and and he sets out a scenario, right? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=977.9599999999999s)]
*  Like if if Trump decides now to pardon people especially the people who committed violent assaults against police officers [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=984.0799999999999s)]
*  What that basically says to Trump supporters and Trump aides or anyone else is [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=991.64s)]
*  If you commit a crime, but you do it for Donald Trump [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=996.96s)]
*  You can do it because he'll just pardon you and so, you know [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1000.88s)]
*  Matt was saying imagine cash cash Patel goes into the FBI and starts ordering a bunch of FBI agents to do [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1004.3199999999999s)]
*  illegal surveillance on all of Trump's political enemies in secret and they don't want to do it but he says oh no, don't worry if [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1009.96s)]
*  you're breaking the law like don't Trump's got you or a [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1015.2s)]
*  Trump aide or a Trump goon goes into Congress and shoots a member of the opposition, you know and [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1018.4s)]
*  And you're in DC and it's a and it's federal jurisdiction and then Trump just pardons them, right? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1024.28s)]
*  And they're like not to say that that's gonna happen [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1028.8s)]
*  But like this is where it leads to start pardoning people who have broken the law some for violent crimes [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1030.8799999999999s)]
*  Just for political reasons. Yeah, and that and those are obviously extreme examples [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1038.1599999999999s)]
*  I thought of glacius's piece was smart in that it it recognized the reality right now, which is [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1042.1799999999998s)]
*  Usually after a president is elected. There's some sort of like rallying around the flag effect of people are like, let's give them a chance [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1048.5s)]
*  You know, let's come together for the country and that's not really what we're seeing this time [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1054.86s)]
*  We are seeing a lot of people even Trump supporters scared of him, right? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1059.26s)]
*  It like Tim Cook giving a million dollars personally to his inauguration [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1063.82s)]
*  Big tech sucking up cutting big checks the inauguration it goes beyond just them [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1068.26s)]
*  Doing it for business reasons. They are scared shitless of him and even his powerful supporters will not [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1074.1s)]
*  criticize anything about Trump and like [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1080.26s)]
*  You know the way he spelled it out in that piece. It makes it makes you think [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1082.46s)]
*  Yeah, and you know part of me thinks okay [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1085.6599999999999s)]
*  Trump hopefully here is a lame duck and at some point, you know, what is the utility of constantly? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1088.9399999999998s)]
*  You know us talking about Trump going after Trump [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1095.22s)]
*  Well, first of all, he's like the president for the next four years and his agenda is gonna matter what he does, right? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1097.46s)]
*  but also I think the Republican Party has learned from Trump that [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1101.9s)]
*  This kind of you know, just loyalty above all else like this is the way this is the way you hack the system [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1106.8600000000001s)]
*  Right like partisanship above all stick together [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1113.3400000000001s)]
*  Just excuse anything possible. And so even when Trump's long gone from the scene they continue this kind of [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1117.0200000000002s)]
*  This kind of attitude this kind of strategy like that. This is what we're gonna get [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1124.18s)]
*  We're in for the midterms to write we make them all comment on it and vote on it. Yep, right [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1127.42s)]
*  Well, that's that's where I think there's some [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1131.22s)]
*  some little glimmer of hope right because all that's true, right like [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1133.62s)]
*  Republicans, they're not afraid of right-wing media because right wing media is on their side [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1137.86s)]
*  They're not afraid of the mainstream media because they've now discovered that it's mattering less and less and less, right? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1141.22s)]
*  They're only afraid of Donald Trump. Donald Trump's the only one who can hurt them [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1145.58s)]
*  That's not true of a vulnerable House Republican who is up for reelection and just wants to keep his or her job, right? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1148.18s)]
*  like there are still places where [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1155.5s)]
*  The the reality distortion of Trump can be broken [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1158.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, which brings us to our next topic because for the next year [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1162.72s)]
*  Which is basically all the time they have two years really to the midterms [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1167.5s)]
*  They're gonna try to pass everything they can because as most parties [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1170.94s)]
*  Do they expect that potentially they could lose the house, right? Maybe the Senate but but the house is definitely in play in 2026 [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1174.98s)]
*  so [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1183.06s)]
*  Let's talk about their their big plans for 2025 [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1184.34s)]
*  Basically one giant bill that includes everything from tax cuts for the rich to money for mass deportations [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1187.3799999999999s)]
*  Some Republicans mostly in the Senate think it would be easier to do immigration first and better to do immigration first in one bill [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1193.32s)]
*  And then taxes in a second bill [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1200.1799999999998s)]
*  Here's what Trump said about it on Hugh Hewitt show. Well, I favor one bill. I also want to get everything passed and [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1202.66s)]
*  You know, there are some people that don't necessarily agree with it [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1210.14s)]
*  So I'm open to that also my preference is one big as I say one big beautiful bill now to do that takes longer [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1213.22s)]
*  You know to submit it takes longer actually, but but so it's a longer process [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1220.18s)]
*  I would say that I'd live with that build back horrible [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1224.9s)]
*  Yeah, we're there again [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1228.98s)]
*  It seems like this is just a question of which path is more politically feasible for Republicans one bill or two [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1230.42s)]
*  But what do you guys think are the considerations are here? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1235.22s)]
*  There are some friction points and immigration which we'll get to in a minute, but immigration seems easier for them than taxes taxes are hard [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1237.42s)]
*  because taxes [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1244.26s)]
*  Taxes get back to kind of good old-fashioned Republican politics, which is the base versus the pro-business funders [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1246.26s)]
*  But so they think they could do and get a do immigration first and get a win on the border and they can keep everybody [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1253.6599999999999s)]
*  in line [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1259.1s)]
*  Which would be good [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1260.5s)]
*  They want to get a quick win on the board [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1261.34s)]
*  But they think they need immigration because tax is gonna be so tough given they only have a one seat majority and though that actually [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1262.62s)]
*  Could become a two or three seat majority once they have these special elections in a couple weeks [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1269.34s)]
*  so the question is do they jeopardize a [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1274.08s)]
*  Quick win that they could get on the border in order to make a tax victory later in the year more feasible because they can use [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1276.56s)]
*  Both to kind of wrangle people and sweeten the deal to get some people in man [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1283.4399999999998s)]
*  If I were them and reading the political wins [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1287.1599999999999s)]
*  I would say Democrats are scared shitless on immigration and of all the things where we might have a chance of getting 60 votes [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1288.84s)]
*  In the Senate, this might be it and I might go for that. But I mean depending on they won't they it's that would be reconciliation, too [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1294.12s)]
*  Well, right. I'm saying like if you're wanting multiple bills because you're only gonna have one or two shots of reconciliation [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1300.04s)]
*  So breaking into pieces requires you to at some point go through the regular process [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1304.42s)]
*  No, basically what there's two reconciliation shells that they have. You do two reconciliation shells [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1308.42s)]
*  The the the the counterpoint of like do a bunch of bills get a bunch of wins [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1313.22s)]
*  Oh, I think it's a question of like do you can you do one? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1316.9s)]
*  Just immigration and then a second one that's everything right? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1320.5s)]
*  But if you look at what they're talking about doing what you read there's proposals that this could be immigration energy policy tax cuts [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1323.42s)]
*  Maybe military spending and then God knows what members of Congress try to jam in there or various lobbyists or whatever [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1330.3799999999999s)]
*  So to look I was just reacting to love its point [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1338.06s)]
*  They're like I do think their strongest political footing is immigration, right? [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1340.1799999999998s)]
*  So do they want to spend it and get the win or do they want to use it to try to get some of their more? [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1344.6599999999999s)]
*  unpopular tax policies across the other thing they have to deal with is [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1348.62s)]
*  For taxes, there's a cliff at the end of the year [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1351.6999999999998s)]
*  So if they don't get so say they do immigration and that takes up a lot of time [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1354.9399999999998s)]
*  I think this is probably why they one reason why they want to do both together [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1359.16s)]
*  So they take a bunch of time integration [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1362.48s)]
*  They get a quick win and then they only have X amount of months left till the end of the year [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1364.0800000000002s)]
*  Because if the Trump tax cuts from last time are set to expire at the end of the year [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1368.4s)]
*  They don't do anything on taxes. They can't agree on something. That means every single person in America their income taxes go up [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1372.2s)]
*  so like tough talk about talk about cliffs that like force you to do things and [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1379.52s)]
*  And so there's so there's that part of it and then they've also there's another side of this which is there's they they have to [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1384.16s)]
*  Raise the debt ceiling and they've promised in order to get the the keep the government open over the holidays [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1390.1200000000001s)]
*  They promised two point five trillion dollars in cuts on top of that [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1395.5s)]
*  so they have they have like they have they've built with themselves quite a [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1399.8400000000001s)]
*  I know what you call it bear traps spending disaster [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1404.8400000000001s)]
*  Extending the tax cuts the Trump tax cut is the price tag from the CBO is four point six trillion over ten years [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1408.7199999999998s)]
*  So there's no way they're gonna be able to pay for this [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1415.62s)]
*  Well, and and some of them don't give a shit right and don't care about paying for it [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1417.52s)]
*  But the Chip Roys of the world and the house and the Freedom Caucus people they've basically mean to your point [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1421.52s)]
*  They've basically said no, we're not and this is where this is for some of them [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1425.6599999999999s)]
*  It's truly is like this is why they're there. This is what they believe it is genuinely motivating [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1429.4199999999998s)]
*  It is a sincerely held belief where they don't really care about Donald Trump, right? [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1434.56s)]
*  It's the one issue right like Chip Roy and some of these people are like they're fine [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1437.96s)]
*  Donald Trump being mad at them because they're like look we're here to you know, eliminate government as much as we can and [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1441.92s)]
*  but like five trillion, I [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1448.5600000000002s)]
*  Mean some of the pay floors that they've been thrown around the tariffs, which is just a tax on consumers [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1451.0800000000002s)]
*  repeal clean all the clean energy investments and clean energy jobs that Joe Biden [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1458.3200000000002s)]
*  Helped create with the Inflation Reduction Act [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1463.0800000000002s)]
*  By the way, just one note on those most of those are red states [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1465.88s)]
*  Yep, and a lot of that money's already out the door repeal student loan forgiveness then get some money from there [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1468.44s)]
*  And then cut the entire education department. They're looking to close down the education department food stamps Medicaid [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1473.8000000000002s)]
*  They've another 40 billion they can get by [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1480.5200000000002s)]
*  Deciding that Medicare and Medicaid cannot cover Ozempic or Wigovia or some of those those new yeah coming for the king [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1484.3200000000002s)]
*  From my cold dead hands and then you know, some of the idiots are still even though [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1492.44s)]
*  You know Trump has publicly ruled it out and other Republican leaders, you know [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1496.68s)]
*  They've talked about Medicare Social Security and all the rest. Well, that's the rub [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1500.3600000000001s)]
*  That's the only way you can actually pay for a price tag this high is to go after entitlements [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1503.32s)]
*  I don't know how they're I mean [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1506.72s)]
*  We'll see we're gonna have a whole year to talk about this, but I don't know how they're going to [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1508.72s)]
*  Square this circle. Yeah many circles. They have to square. There's you can get look we Democrats do Republicans do it [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1512.96s)]
*  There's some budget trickery they can do right they can sunset certain things and set up a new cliff down the road like their [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1518.68s)]
*  Ways and get around it again like you getting that by Chip Roy and those guys [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1523.72s)]
*  But yeah, so there's that but then there's also just Donald Trump saying that Medicare and Social Security are off the table means you're pushing for [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1526.48s)]
*  steeper and actually more difficult far more difficult [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1532.8000000000002s)]
*  Cuts to get through Congress on Medicaid on food stamps on on veterans by the way [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1535.48s)]
*  They're talking about cutting veterans and the debt limit thing makes it harder [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1540.48s)]
*  So the debt limit go expires in late spring early summer [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1543.16s)]
*  Which is I think one of the reasons they're talking about April or May to get this on Trump's desk, which like good luck with that [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1546.52s)]
*  Now if you do debt limit [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1553.0s)]
*  Within a reconciliation bill like either these bills they're talking about then Republicans can lift the debt limit or eliminate the debt limit on their own [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1554.8799999999999s)]
*  Right, they don't need Democrats because Democrats are going to vote for this because it's 51 votes [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1561.84s)]
*  But if they can't agree to include the debt limit in one of these bills or just one bill if they're do one bill [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1564.76s)]
*  Then they have to negotiate with Democrats because then you have the 60 vote threshold [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1570.84s)]
*  And so like [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1575.04s)]
*  But the hard thing about doing the debt limit in the reconciliation bill is again the Freedom Caucus because they're gonna be like [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1577.12s)]
*  Oh, we're gonna raise the debt limit and spend five trillion dollars on tax cuts [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1582.12s)]
*  It's just getting them all to agree even just the Republicans in the house on [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1586.08s)]
*  Everything you write down in a bill about all these various issue areas seems almost impossible to me, especially with a pretty weak speaker [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1590.48s)]
*  Do you guys have any thoughts on like so Democrats don't have the votes to stop any of this? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1597.76s)]
*  And you know, we can't call them feckless for it [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1602.64s)]
*  They don't have the votes that you everyone should know Democrats cannot stop anything in Congress right now. Just they don't they can't [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1605.48s)]

*  I look I think the the look I think you can they're trying to cut [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1642.88s)]
*  Social-security Medicare or Medicaid basic services for people in order to pay tax pay for tax cuts for their wealthiest [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1647.88s)]
*  Benefactors friends and cronies and the biggest corporation shipping jobs overseas [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1652.72s)]
*  There's some like basic stuff that you can do [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1655.44s)]
*  My question is only like how much should Democrats get ahead of the part of this? [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1657.28s)]
*  Which is that some of the tax cuts a small portion of it [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1660.68s)]
*  But some of the Trump tax cuts for tax cuts for the middle class for the working class, right? [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1663.08s)]
*  And so you need to get out there and say here's our proposal, right? We would love to extend the tax breaks [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1667.28s)]
*  Yeah for the middle class [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1671.56s)]
*  We'd love to attend the tax breaks for working people in this country and we'd love to attach it to a raise in the minimum [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1672.68s)]
*  Wage Donald Trump says he's for work. And by the way, you want to do no tax on tips [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1677.36s)]
*  Here's our proposal for no tax on tips. We'll do all the middle class stuff [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1680.0s)]
*  And here's alien we know how to pay for it [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1683.28s)]
*  Yeah [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1685.16s)]
*  Now it's your turn because I think like that to me is where they're gonna try to say the Democrats are for a big tax [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1685.5600000000002s)]
*  Increase it's as simple as like they they want to attack they want to cut taxes for rich people and they want you to pay for it [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1689.88s)]
*  That's it. You're you get the bill. It's not free. It's a huge giveaway to them. You get the bill. That's I mean like yeah the [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1694.3600000000001s)]
*  2017 tax cut the households with incomes in the top 1% got an average tax cut of [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1701.3200000000002s)]
*  $60,000 in 2025 compared to the average tax cut of less than $500 for households in the bottom 60% according to the tax policy center [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1707.3200000000002s)]
*  So you just have to make the case that we are spending we're burning trillions of dollars on tax cuts for the richest people in [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1714.98s)]
*  The country. How do you pay for that on the back end? It's gonna be cuts to Social Security Medicare programs [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1720.24s)]
*  You care about I also think you can potentially and potentially tariffs which is big tax. Yes. Yes [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1725.8400000000001s)]
*  And I do think you can find I think we should look for some kind of process point about [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1729.46s)]
*  How bad this process is like Elon Musk was really mad about the length of the omnibus spending bill back in December [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1734.96s)]
*  Right remember then they all were really happy that it went from 1500 pages to 100 pages like way do you read this one buddy? [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1742.8400000000001s)]
*  I know I was thinking that when I was reading it today like their whole yeah [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1748.7800000000002s)]
*  one thing we all missed hopefully you all missed it over the holiday break was the [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1752.0800000000002s)]
*  There was the omnibus spending bill that almost shut the government down because Elon almost shut the government down and then and then Mike Johnson [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1756.64s)]
*  barely won the speakership [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1764.62s)]
*  So like if you think anything's gonna be easy to pass through the house with you to the point about Elon though [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1766.86s)]
*  Like I do think that like we gotta make this more vivid for people [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1771.94s)]
*  Trump now has a cabinet full of billionaires and fuck. It's like you're either a billionaire or a former Fox News host literally [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1775.74s)]
*  Yeah, that's basically the whole cabinet and then you got Elon there you got the other tech bros [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1781.84s)]
*  I would like have pictures of them with what kind of tax cut they're gonna get we can calculate it [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1785.72s)]
*  Elon's getting this many billion this one's Scott Bessemer or whatever the fucking Treasury Secretary is getting this much like we gotta make it [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1790.54s)]
*  proud gay American I just like we used to do this we used to do this back in like [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1796.6000000000001s)]
*  2010 and 12 with fucking like the you know how much Warren Buffett's getting versus his secretary being Warren Buffett actually offered that [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1801.46s)]
*  Yeah, you know example like why don't we do that shit anymore remember the the Cornhusker kickback [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1808.7s)]
*  Oh [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1813.68s)]
*  2010 as part of the [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1816.5600000000002s)]
*  Debate around the Affordable Care Act the Obama administration or the Democrats are trying to get votes from Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska and [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1818.44s)]
*  Basically the bill as one written in one version gave massive subsidies to the state of Nebraska [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1825.6000000000001s)]
*  To try to get his vote and it became a huge scandal an example of pork barrel spending and it also got stripped out [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1832.2s)]
*  And I think the Cornhusker kickback was part of the reason Nelson didn't run for re-election [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1838.92s)]
*  Yeah in 2012 so you got to find that thing you know there will be some some dirty pool being played by John Thune and Johnson [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1843.88s)]
*  and the congressional leaders also [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1849.96s)]
*  it was sort of a [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1852.04s)]
*  The Cornhusker kickback he was fighting for a kickback for Cornhuskers [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1854.1200000000001s)]
*  Why wouldn't you like that? [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1858.6000000000001s)]
*  Don't you want your Cornhusker Center to fight for Cornhusker kickbacks tip O'Neill did for his whole career [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1860.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I I bet another reason they want to do it in one bill too is because they are hoping to bait Democrats [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1864.68s)]
*  by [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1872.44s)]
*  Including some of the worst sort of culture war stuff in this bill right and immigration is obviously the prime example [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1873.88s)]
*  And they I'm sure they want Democrats to focus all of our outrage on that and then just quietly do the tax cuts in [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1879.8s)]
*  The background because you know the hardcore mega people they don't give a shit about the tax cuts like I know we have [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1886.88s)]
*  We have told ourselves that it's like they're cutting they're cutting this to pay for this and that is what they're doing [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1892.24s)]
*  But the real mag the Laura Loomers and the Steve Bannon's they don't give a shit about the tax cuts [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1896.88s)]
*  they just hate immigrants and [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1901.44s)]

*  They want to go after immigrants and so I do think that [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1908.08s)]
*  they will they will try to push the tax cuts to sort of the like the [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1910.76s)]
*  Backrooms right I'm just negotiate that and then like throw out bait for the rest of us to like freak out about which by the [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=1915.12s)]

*  then things got crazy Bannon said that [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2167.08s)]
*  If Musk doesn't watch himself quote we're going to rip your face off for his part [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2170.56s)]
*  Elon told h1b opponents to quote fuck yourself in the face and endorsed a post that referred to American workers as quote [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2174.88s)]
*  Retarded the vague Ramaswami then jumped in to argue that American workers are lazy because quote a culture that venerates [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2182.44s)]
*  Zack and Slater over screech and saved by the bell or Stefan over Steve Urkel and family matters [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2189.2s)]
*  Will not produce the best engineers incredible incredible Trump finally settled the whole thing [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2195.4s)]
*  For now by coming out in favor of the h1b program saying that he's used it too [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2200.36s)]
*  But we think he's confused because he's used the other h1b program [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2204.36s)]
*  That is more about lower skilled workers that you can bring in from his hotels. No, I don't know [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2208.56s)]
*  I'll know but h1b if you go look at it, it's actually defined really strangely [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2214.44s)]
*  It says for h1b that it is for skilled workers and fashion models [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2219.2400000000002s)]
*  And so I actually think that's right is the fashion model and so I think it might be because [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2223.84s)]
*  Melania Melania and others but [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2228.44s)]
*  Melania [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2231.8399999999997s)]
*  What do you make of this fight love it? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2233.04s)]
*  Beautiful marketplace of ideas [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2235.24s)]
*  What I thought what I thought is that it's as if all these guys were kind of standing in an open field [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2238.2s)]
*  And then somebody stepped on a twig and they all started shooting, you know, it's like that the piece broke [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2244.24s)]
*  the the thing that was interesting to me is like the first of all, it's like [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2250.3999999999996s)]
*  It's interesting just to see Elon Musk turn his like kind of way of talking about politics as somebody who is new to politics [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2254.52s)]
*  which is just like there's two kinds of people your friends and [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2260.1200000000003s)]
*  Retarded pedophiles. It's like that's how we talk about politics terrific [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2264.7200000000003s)]
*  But if you put the name-calling part of it aside [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2268.88s)]
*  It was interesting to watch Elon Musk [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2271.52s)]
*  Like he said he said think of it like a pro sports team if you want your team to win the championship [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2273.28s)]
*  You need to recruit top talent wherever they may be that enables the whole team to win [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2278.1200000000003s)]
*  Which is not just an argument for the h1b visa is an argument for immigration and he found himself [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2281.76s)]
*  Just because he happened to have experience with this one kind of immigration defending the concept of immigration and because he is new to this [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2287.96s)]
*  He doesn't realize how anathema that is to all of these anti-agreent anti-immigrant right-wing zealots [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2295.1200000000003s)]
*  he has he and others in the tech world have let themselves believe that the opposition to [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2299.8s)]
*  all the talk about immigration from Trump and MAGA has really just been about the border and [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2304.96s)]
*  People who've come here who have been you know violent criminals and the Lake and Riley stuff and all that like they let themselves believe that [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2309.68s)]
*  was the case or at least some of them have and [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2316.48s)]
*  now and some of the just [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2319.08s)]
*  unbelievably straight-up [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2321.6s)]
*  Racist shit that was said over the holiday break about this from some of the Trump people was fucking [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2323.36s)]
*  Why they were just like what to your point when he said it were like imagine [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2328.96s)]
*  We're all in the same team people on the right MAGA people were like no, we're not in the same team [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2332.2799999999997s)]
*  We don't want them on our team. We're racist. They should be in another country [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2336.0s)]
*  They shouldn't be here. This is a riff. This is not new to tech bros versus MAGA world. This is a Republican [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2338.48s)]
*  Fault line like when George W. Bush proposed immigration reform comprehensive immigration reform [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2345.04s)]
*  He included a guest worker program because the the free market pro immigrant pro business [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2350.56s)]
*  Right has always understood that when you give the base the enforcement and border security [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2355.28s)]
*  They demand you have to for the sake of the economy [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2359.56s)]
*  Acknowledging the law that is that our businesses and corporations run on cheap immigrant labor [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2363.1600000000003s)]
*  And so this has always been the the the friction point in this debate for Republicans [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2369.92s)]
*  I just think we need to spend one more minute on the VVM [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2374.92s)]
*  I'm a Swami sure her screen because I think it was written from inside a locker that he had been stuffed in [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2378.44s)]
*  I know I'm in the 90s like we're a culture that elevates the prom king over the math [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2384.44s)]
*  More movies like whiplash fewer reruns of friends more math tutoring fewer sleepovers [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2390.6s)]
*  Like what are you talking about fewer sleepovers more weekend science competitions fewer Saturday morning cartoons [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2395.9599999999996s)]
*  You are such a loser and this and this led David Brooks in the Atlantic to write a piece titled the vague [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2401.4799999999996s)]
*  Rama Swami is not invited to my sleepover [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2406.2s)]
*  That's real [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2412.2s)]
*  By the way [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2415.04s)]
*  I think I have the credibility in this issue as the person who was at the Saturday math [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2415.7599999999998s)]
*  competitions and was not at the sleepovers and someone who was very clearly a screech desperately trying to [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2420.0s)]
*  Figure out what it what what all these acts I'm sitting at table to fucking Zach's [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2427.04s)]
*  No, I just you know someone pointed to that on Twitter that [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2430.4399999999996s)]
*  Clearly he did not really watch saved by the bell because if you had like I watched every episode about three times [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2435.6s)]
*  Zach did better on his SATs than screech was a whole it was a whole episode [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2440.8s)]
*  Yes, yes the the big grand reveal that screech is also stupid [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2445.08s)]
*  That's not just lazy, but also brilliant terrific great model. Thanks a lot kind of making a big point [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2450.04s)]
*  Real life screeches life [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2456.88s)]
*  Seems like a pretty nice normal guy anyway anything else about this can be our Sputnik moment [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2460.6s)]
*  He actually put that like the great thing about this tweet from the vague is it was universally destroyed the far-right hated it [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2465.62s)]
*  The right hated it the left mocked it. It was a beautiful thing [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2471.54s)]
*  One other interesting thing on this is that like the some folks on the left like Bernie Sanders have been [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2475.06s)]
*  They basically sided with the Bannon's on this one not by being openly xenophobic at all [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2481.66s)]
*  I'm not saying that but and fairness to them people on the left have been complaining about the h1b visa program like long before [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2487.18s)]
*  Exploitative and yes Sanders argument is it allows companies to hire foreign workers for less money [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2493.86s)]
*  And then they have more power over those workers because if they leave the job they can be forced to leave the country [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2500.0200000000004s)]
*  So but you know they use the term which might be going a bit far which is like they're indentured servants, you know [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2505.98s)]
*  And but if in our suburb he then called for reforms like increasing guest worker fees for corporations raising minimum wage for guest workers [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2512.1000000000004s)]
*  Allowing them to easily switch jobs, which I think are all good reforms to the programs [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2520.54s)]
*  but I do think like a [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2525.22s)]
*  Lot of folks on the left and center-left like jumped in to be like well [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2527.54s)]
*  Elon Musk is right on this one stuff like that [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2531.66s)]
*  But if we're just if we're thinking about the economy now and we're thinking about sort of inequality and the angst that sort of drove [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2533.1s)]
*  this election [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2540.64s)]
*  For a lot of people who drove a lot of people to vote for Trump [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2542.14s)]
*  I do think it's worth pointing out that like Elon Musk and some of these tech founders and tech CEOs like they like having cheap labor [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2544.84s)]
*  they do and one reason they like the h1b visa program is because [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2552.66s)]
*  You know [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2557.4s)]
*  It's gonna help them get richer [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2558.12s)]
*  And I think if we say that a lot of these guys a lot of these Elon folks and the oligarchs who are now running [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2559.64s)]
*  Our country when they come out for something. It's because it's usually gonna make them a lot of fucking money [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2563.8s)]
*  Yeah, the the you know Bernie also always think you can be for immigration [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2568.0s)]
*  More immigration in this country and still recognize what their motivations are. Well, Bernie has always been against [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2572.3999999999996s)]
*  H1B is a form of guest worker as is the farm worker programs that have been always that that Bush has been proposed that were [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2579.12s)]
*  Debated when Obama was proposing comprehensive immigration reform, and I I'm not sure if he's always been completely against it [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2584.4399999999996s)]
*  But Bernie's always been I think ideologically and and [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2589.16s)]
*  Ethically opposed to them because they are really ultimately about creating a kind of second-class [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2592.6s)]
*  status for a certain kind of worker and the point that like I can't remember which right-wing ghoul in between their [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2596.3999999999996s)]
*  Racist rants went and looked at the entry-level positions that have been filled by h1b visas [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2601.8s)]
*  It was loomer [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2605.98s)]
*  But like yeah [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2606.88s)]
*  Like these are this is supposed to be you can't find the person in the US and you're gonna pay them what you would pay [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2608.1600000000003s)]
*  a US worker and obviously [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2613.04s)]
*  As Elon knows and as all these right-wing people know that is not how it is used [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2615.4s)]
*  It is used to fill a bunch of positions for for for for less pay. Yeah [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2619.0s)]
*  So Tommy this wasn't Elon's only notable foray into politics over the holidays. It's been busy. Yeah, what's what's he's uh, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2624.2400000000002s)]
*  He's now going he's he's he's taking the show on the road from from the US [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2631.04s)]
*  He's going on tour [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2635.88s)]
*  I do think this important thing to watch I've been and I're gonna talk about this tomorrow on pod save the world [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2636.88s)]
*  But like so we all watched Elon turn Twitter into a propaganda tool for Trump and then dump what a hundred some-odd million dollars [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2640.72s)]
*  Into pro Trump super facts, but now he's starting to mess around in other countries [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2647.58s)]
*  And so it's I think it started in Germany where he was been [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2651.2s)]
*  He has been attacking the Chancellor as Kyle off Schultz social Democrat for a long time [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2655.04s)]
*  But then over the break he endorsed the AFD which is a very extreme super far-right pro-Putin party in Germany [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2658.84s)]
*  In the UK Elon has been attacking Keir Starmer the new Prime Minister or Labour Prime Minister [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2666.44s)]
*  But it got really ugly recently [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2671.92s)]
*  Elon said that Starmer was quote complicit in the rape of Britain and that he should be arrested [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2674.36s)]
*  And then he also said he was deeply complicit in the mass rapes in exchange for votes [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2680.08s)]
*  he's talking about this horrific horrific scandal where [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2684.04s)]
*  A decade or two ago a bunch of young girls like 1400 or more girls were sexually abused in this awful [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2688.06s)]
*  It's also it's called the grooming gang scandal won't get into all the details of it [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2694.8599999999997s)]
*  But Elon is dredging that back up to attack Starmer and then I think just today [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2698.3799999999997s)]
*  Elon went after [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2704.58s)]
*  He started boosting far-right candidates in Canada, and he's also been boosting far-right parties and candidates in the UK [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2707.66s)]
*  He met with Nigel Farage. I think in Mar-a-Lago [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=2713.7s)]

*  It was interesting because it was about what happens at the book report the book report section. I like shows over the shows over [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=3345.7s)]

*  I will give you three books John, but I'll start with this one [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=3354.98s)]
*  What was interesting about it is it was about what happens in a country after the fascist? [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=3357.66s)]
*  Fervor breaks and everyone's just looking around being like why did you do this to us? [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=3362.5s)]
*  And it was it was interesting what happens a lot of people are pretty sad [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=3366.74s)]
*  Mm-hmm [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=3372.04s)]
*  But it was more but it was interesting just because it was this this older guy [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=3373.24s)]
*  grappling with his involvement and [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=3377.76s)]
*  The younger generation looking at disgust at what they did to the country [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=3380.26s)]
*  Yeah, and it just reminded me as I was reading it that like there's a lot about what happens on the way in [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=3383.6s)]
*  But there's also a way out. Well, it's also interesting that like [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=3388.64s)]
*  You just mentioned the fascist fervor and it's like I don't even think there's that much fervor, right? [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=3392.44s)]
*  Like a lot of it is like apathy or people being checked out or denial or like [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=3396.54s)]
*  Whatever. I was I was annoyed [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=3402.28s)]
*  you know people sort of a lot of people have probably voted for Trump out of like disgust with both choices, right and and and it's just [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=3403.6000000000004s)]
*  people are gonna be in for a [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=3410.6000000000004s)]
*  Rude awakening. Yeah, there's that part of it [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=3412.88s)]
*  There's also a great piece in ProPublica from a couple days ago called the Oath Keepers militia mole [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=3415.1200000000003s)]
*  I think is the title it's the militia in the mole [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=3420.6800000000003s)]
*  It's about this guy who just decided on his own to infiltrate like the three percenters and the Oath Keepers and all these right-wing [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=3422.7000000000003s)]
*  groups [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=3427.6400000000003s)]
*  And his story about why he did that even though he didn't do it on behalf of the cops [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=3428.52s)]
*  He just wanted to expose them [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=3432.7599999999998s)]
*  but the the the degree to which these groups now feel ascendant and [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=3434.08s)]
*  Validated because of Trump's reelection is very scary and it goes back to the pardon issue too with January 6 because if they see them [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=3439.24s)]
*  Getting a pardon they'll feel pretty emboldened. So anyway coming attractions should we do more books? Yeah [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=3446.44s)]
*  What else you read? I'm reading the wide wide sea by Hamptonsides. It's about Captain James Cook [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=3453.12s)]
*  famous British explorer [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=3458.88s)]
*  Obviously a lot of downsides to these guys running around the world spreading diseases and rats and [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=3460.68s)]
*  all killing off native peoples [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=3467.08s)]
*  but also kind of fascinating to imagine a period of time when you could hop in a boat and go someplace that [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=3468.92s)]
*  No one you knew would ever heard of even it wasn't on a map. Well, Tommy's getting ideas [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=3474.48s)]

*  Read and I I read Henry Kissinger's last book about AI that he wrote with Eric Schmidt because it's very short [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=3518.2400000000002s)]

*  Oh, do you guys know Trump had a book called the art of the comeback from 1997? [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeZ8x2erhec&t=3537.48s)]
