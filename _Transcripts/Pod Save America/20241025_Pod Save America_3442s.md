Video Description: Donald Trump tries to win over the last few undecided voters by calling immigrants "garbage" and campaigning with Tucker Carlson, who says America is a "bad little girl" who needs a spanking. Harris strikes a different note, contrasting Trump's "enemies list" with her "to do list," and rallying with Beyoncé, Bruce Springsteen, and the Obamas. Jon and Dan break down all the latest moves, including the strategy behind the big closing argument speech Harris will deliver on Tuesday. Then, Texas Congressman Colin Allred joins the show to discuss Harris's rally in Houston, and his plans for beating Ted Cruz.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Kamala Harris Attacks Donald Trump On The Economy And Calls Him A Fascist
**Pod Save America:** [October 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c)
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Jon Favreau. I'm Dan Pfeiffer. On today's show with a little over one week until Election Day, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=0.0s)]
*  both candidates are trying to close the deal with the remaining undecided voters. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=6.96s)]
*  Kamala Harris has the Obamas, Beyonce in a big speech in DC at the scene of the January 6th attack. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  While Donald Trump has Elon Musk an interview with Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson calling him a daddy who's ready to spank America. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=16.68s)]
*  Wild stuff. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=26.2s)]
*  Not making it up. Not a joke, folks. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=27.6s)]
*  And later, Texas Congressman Colin Allred stops by to talk about Kamala's last-minute visit to his home state and the latest in his [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=30.0s)]
*  critical race to unseat Ted Cruz. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=37.0s)]
*  But first, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=39.64s)]
*  not one but two four-star generals who worked for Donald Trump have now called him a fascist who praised Hitler. And so the big debate is, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=41.28s)]
*  will it hurt Kamala Harris? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  God, I hate everything. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=52.92s)]
*  I'm kidding, kind of, kind of. You're not. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=55.0s)]
*  But the vice president was asked about John Kelly's comments during a CNN town hall with undecided [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=58.28s)]
*  Pennsylvania voters on Wednesday night in a possible preview of the closing argument speech she'll give next Tuesday. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  Here's what she said. You've quoted General Milley calling Donald Trump a fascist. You yourself have not used that word to describe him. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=70.36s)]
*  Let me ask you tonight. Do you think Donald Trump is a fascist? Yes, I do. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  Yes, I do. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=81.6s)]
*  And I also believe that the people who know him best on this subject should be trusted. And he's gonna sit there [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=83.28s)]
*  unstable, unhinged, plotting his revenge, plotting his retribution, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=92.16000000000001s)]
*  creating an enemies list. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=98.04s)]
*  I'm gonna tell you my list will be a list of how I address and continue to address the issues that you all are raising [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=100.72s)]
*  this afternoon and evening. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=107.12s)]
*  It will be a to do list about how we can impact the American people. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=108.88s)]
*  All right, she used the F word, Dan. I didn't see too many pearls clutched over this. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=113.36s)]
*  But what did you think of that answer on John Kelly? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=119.52s)]
*  I think if the retired four star general responsible for implementing Donald Trump's draconian immigration policies, then became the chief of staff, thinks he's a fascist. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=123.2s)]
*  Who is Kamala Harris to disagree with that? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=131.36s)]
*  I mean, she had to say yes to it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=133.68s)]
*  It's like it is sort of like a dumb DC trap. Like, are you going to use the word? Are you gonna use the word? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=136.4s)]
*  I know you've described him as in the following ways, but are you gonna use the actual the actual word? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  Use the word in his name in the same sentence? Are you gonna do it? Are you gonna do it? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=145.84s)]
*  And it's kind of a dumb conversation. We can talk about [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=149.68s)]
*  the political discourse around whether it hurts or anything else. What I do like is the construction that came after that, which is an enemies list [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=152.72s)]
*  and a to do list. Donald Trump's going to be seeking vengeance to [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=159.12s)]
*  satisfy his own needs and Kamala Harris is going to be out there doing things for you. Like that's the right framework because you have to make [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=163.28s)]
*  it matter to people's lives because the idea whether he's a fascist is an esoteric [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=170.64s)]
*  concept to a lot of people and a lot of people probably even know what the word means or can't really define it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=175.04s)]
*  I was going to say if you asked a sample of people in this country to find fascism, I think you'd be [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=179.04s)]
*  bewildered by what you find. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=185.28s)]
*  And maybe a little disappointed. They do know Hitler. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=187.83999999999997s)]
*  You're right. There's three different answers you can give to that question. No, he's not a fascist, which obviously she's not going to say. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=192.48s)]
*  She said yes, or she could have done something like [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=199.84s)]
*  let me tell you what I think he is and then defined him herself. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=202.95999999999998s)]
*  But that's sort of like a squirrely answer and then Anderson Cooper would have said okay, so yes or no fascist, right? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=206.16s)]
*  And then suddenly it's a whole thing. And if she doesn't say yes, then it's out of the headlines. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=210.88s)]
*  And again, I'm sure the Harris campaign probably thinks it's a good day for them [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=216.0s)]
*  when their opponent is in the headlines because four star generals who worked for him think he's a fascist [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=221.04s)]
*  who and said that he praised Hitler. I [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=227.6s)]
*  knew in politics, but I don't know. I feel like it's bad for you when people who used to work for you who are in the military [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=231.2s)]
*  said that you're a fascist who praised Hitler. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=238.88s)]
*  We think. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=241.68s)]
*  Everything is so stupid, Dan. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=246.0s)]
*  The whole thing is so it just there is like a very serious thing here, which is [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=248.24s)]
*  put aside the use of whether Milley and Kelly and all the rest of the people use the term fascist. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=252.88s)]
*  What they're telling us is that he is a dangerous man who has tried on multiple occasions to use military force against [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=257.84s)]
*  American citizens and believes that the people who work for him, including the members of the military, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=266.16s)]
*  should be personally loyal to Trump over their loyalty to the constitution of the nation. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=271.52s)]
*  He that is the thinker whether we use the word or not is an idiotic [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=275.36s)]
*  Washington DC debate. It just speaks to the ability of politics [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=279.36s)]
*  political discourse in the media in this country to pull every important issue to its dumbest possible formulation. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=282.64s)]
*  Okay, I feel a little bit better for saying that he wanted the Department of Justice to investigate his political opponents. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=289.36s)]
*  He wanted the IRS to audit his political opponents. He wanted to withhold federal aid to uh, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=296.64s)]
*  places in the country that needed it but didn't vote for him. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  He asked his defense secretary why he couldn't shoot why the military couldn't shoot unarmed protesters Black Lives Matter's protesters. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=307.52s)]
*  He's asked multiple times why he couldn't use the military against protesters. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=315.68s)]
*  He has been threatening to take away CBS's broadcast license because Kamala Harris did an interview with them that made him mad. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=320.0s)]
*  Right as we're recording, he just once again said that the press are bad people that they are the enemy [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=328.32s)]
*  of the people and he doesn't like them. Like what okay call it whatever you want to call that you can call it [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=333.68s)]
*  you can call him a fascist. You can call him a strong man. You can call him a demagogue a tyrant. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=339.68s)]
*  Whatever the fuck you you call him an asshole if you want but he's the guy wants to take away people's freedoms. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=343.52000000000004s)]
*  He's already taken reproductive freedom away from the women of this country. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=349.92s)]
*  He wants to come after freedom of the press freedom to protest and criticize him freedom to join a union freedom to see a doctor [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=354.56s)]
*  when you're sick go on and on and on. That's what he wants to do. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=360.72s)]
*  So I think you're right like talking about the what Trump will do the threat of a fascist like Trump [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=363.36s)]
*  is probably going to be more important to voters than just a definition or a debate over the definition of the world the word fascist. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  Harris also answered questions about the economy abortion immigration mistake she's made in the past. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=377.68s)]
*  Overall, it seems as though some of the undecided voters CNN spoke to afterwards approved. Let's listen. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=383.52000000000004s)]
*  I think if I had to pick right now I would I would pick her. I think she is a better candidate. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=389.52000000000004s)]
*  And you're a registered Republican. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=394.24s)]
*  I'm an independent. You're an independent now. Yes, who'd you vote for in 2020? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=396.56s)]
*  Um, I voted for Trump. I came out of this feeling. Um, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=400.56s)]
*  uh, just kind of a feeling of adoration of her personally. I think personally she is [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=405.44s)]
*  a good person and there was a nice connection especially as a woman. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=411.84000000000003s)]
*  I believe it was you that asked the weakness question, you know, what is what is your biggest weakness? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=416.8s)]
*  And she brought up that she has people around her that she can trust that she can get the answer from [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=420.88s)]
*  in my line of work in it. I don't expect everybody to know the answer. I expect them to know how to get the answer [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=426.16s)]
*  and her specifically that resonated with me. Do you know how you get the answer in it? You call the it guy [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=431.92s)]
*  That's the subject where I definitely don't know the answer. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=440.16s)]
*  Um, so it always feels like there's a bit of a gap between pundit reaction and voter reaction. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=442.32000000000005s)]
*  Uh, this the I can tell you the CNN panel did not have a similar reaction to those undecided voters in Pennsylvania [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=448.24s)]
*  who are actually going to decide the election. What do you make of the the gap there? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=453.84000000000003s)]
*  Well over the long sweep of history, this is not the first time there's been a gap between how pundits have interpreted a candidates performance [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=458.08000000000004s)]
*  and how voters have done it. But [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=463.84000000000003s)]
*  Let's just say a couple things here one [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=466.16s)]
*  typically in these sorts of things [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=468.56s)]
*  Pundits are looking at this from a very different perspective, right? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=471.2s)]
*  They're like they are judging it like a like a judge at a figure skating event at the olympics, right? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=473.44s)]
*  We'll always say yeah figure. Yeah, what do the figure skating judges have to say? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=478.32s)]
*  Yes, the the russian judges he would call it because you can't get you can't get a fair. Uh, you can't get a fair [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=481.76s)]
*  score and [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=487.28s)]
*  It's just like she she misses opportunities like there's this question about the mistakes and she missed an opportunity to separate herself from Biden [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=488.88s)]
*  That's like just not how normal people think about this stuff [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=494.48s)]
*  So that's one two is and we've seen in all of the research i've seen all the message testing i've seen [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=497.04s)]
*  There's like a very simple truth here, which is that [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=502.0s)]
*  When people see kamala harris, they're more likely to vote for her [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=505.28000000000003s)]
*  Just she and you think about it [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=508.96000000000004s)]
*  It's sort of mind-boggling listening to people that they weren't decided before this moment [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=510.88s)]
*  But the fact that they were they probably actually had not seen very much of her [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=513.6800000000001s)]
*  Maybe they saw tv commercials of her but not her actually speaking there. She's up there [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=516.96s)]
*  She's answering tough questions from reporters and citizens [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=520.96s)]
*  She is doing her best to answer the answer them earnestly and truthfully [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=524.5600000000001s)]
*  And she is a serious person who seems to care about people is in it for the right reasons and knows something about policy [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=528.08s)]
*  The other side you got this other fucking yahoo yapping around about arnold palmer's putter and all this other shit that's happening [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=533.84s)]
*  And so just like if you're like you can see why this is why she's doing these things because when people see her they like [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=540.08s)]
*  her and that is if you're looking for reasons to be optimistic down the stretch here [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=545.12s)]
*  That is the reason be optimistic because the more people see kamala harris the more likely they are to vote for her [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=548.5600000000001s)]
*  Because she she has better life than trump [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=552.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean look [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=554.56s)]
*  a lot of these pundits, uh, some of them are democratic strategists some of them are journalists we've done this too like [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=556.64s)]
*  Part of this is born out of a desire for kamala harris to win [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=563.04s)]
*  Because a lot of these people know what a threat donald trump is right and you know [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=568.0s)]
*  Democratic strategists can be open about it some of the journalists maybe not a lot of these people want kamala harris to win [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=572.8s)]
*  And they're so nervous as we are because it's so fucking close [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=578.3199999999999s)]
*  And so we're scrutinizing every performance and everything she says and want it to be perfect so badly because we want her to win [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=582.64s)]
*  Right because we don't we're worried about how it's going to play with some voter if she says something wrong [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=590.4s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=596.48s)]
*  She's going to make mistakes and she's going to say things that are wrong [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=597.76s)]
*  And also she's got the weight of the world on her shoulders right now. She has been the nominee for 90 days [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=600.24s)]
*  This is her whole campaign. She was thrust into this. Is that what it is? Yeah, 90 day campaign basically [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=606.4s)]
*  Jesus christ, I know and so like I and look you can see some of the her answers where I thought were like crisp great [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=613.12s)]
*  Whatever some of them were, you know [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=619.12s)]
*  When she doesn't want to answer a question because she's worried about sort of like the political implications of saying x or y [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=620.72s)]
*  She sort of like devolves into a little bit of word salad [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=626.48s)]
*  Like that's just what she does and every politician has that kind of dodge and by the way [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=628.5600000000001s)]
*  Almost every other presidential candidate has like a whole year [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=633.36s)]
*  too [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=636.48s)]
*  This is a very important point practice giving uh bad answers to questions [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=637.36s)]
*  Uh, because they all do it and you usually practice like off broadway for a while before you [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=641.68s)]
*  Are thrust into the spotlight. She did not have that opportunity [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=646.5600000000001s)]
*  And she has run a near flawless campaign [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=649.44s)]
*  And so like yeah once in a while when she gets a question that's like sort of politically tricky [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=652.4s)]
*  She does you know, she's just gonna say a bunch of words to avoid actually answering it [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=656.48s)]
*  But you gotta think a the other guy wants to shoot the protesters, uh, and b [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=660.72s)]
*  Voters don't actually judge these candidates as harshly as the pundits do and like I sort of learned this with the vance walls debate [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=667.76s)]
*  Like vance was very polished wall stumbled a few times and then after the debate voters were like, oh [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=674.8s)]
*  JD vance might have won the debate, but I liked him walls better. He's just he's just a better guy [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=680.48s)]
*  Uh, and because they can see through the bullshit, right? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=685.1999999999999s)]
*  And so I think sometimes we treat voters even that we are frustrated with them for being undecided [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=687.84s)]
*  But therefore we treat them as stupid [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=692.08s)]
*  Uh, and they're not stupid they kind of get it and they get that sometimes people don't answer a question or something [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=693.84s)]
*  Whatever, but like the overall impression of kamala harris that was left with these voters was a real favorable one [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=698.08s)]
*  And that is that was true at the debate that was true at the convention [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=704.0s)]
*  It's every time i've seen a dial test about one of her appearances whether it's the podcasts [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=706.08s)]
*  she's been doing at the interviews is she [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=710.16s)]
*  leaves every interaction [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=713.4399999999999s)]
*  with [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=715.92s)]
*  The voters who see her and they're it's hard to get people to see her but with the voters who see her liking her more [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=716.88s)]
*  And being more open to vote for her. Yeah, it doesn't mean she's going to win [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=721.36s)]
*  But for the voters who are seeing her they they like and that's that's the challenge. Yeah, exactly [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=724.24s)]
*  Uh, so as I mentioned earlier the harris campaign has announced that the vice president will be giving a closing argument speech on tuesday evening [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=729.04s)]
*  On the ellipse that's part of the national mall just beyond the white house south fence where donald trump appeared at the stop the steel rally [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=735.68s)]
*  On january 6th and of course urged his followers to march to the capital [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=742.3199999999999s)]
*  We all know what happened next. Um [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=747.4399999999999s)]
*  What is the strategy behind? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=749.92s)]
*  Doing a speech like this in general and then what do you think about this location? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=751.92s)]
*  I mean you've written a bunch of these so you probably some really smart things to say about it [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=756.7199999999999s)]
*  But the ultimate idea here is there's like a handful of events during a campaign where the press will cover you and give you pretty [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=760.56s)]
*  Straight coverage, right? They'll just say here's what our candidate had to say today [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=766.3199999999999s)]
*  This is their message and one of them is that whatever speech it is you label [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=769.84s)]
*  Especially your announcement speech your convention speech and your closing argument speech [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=773.76s)]
*  We label it my closing argument speech and what you're trying to do there is [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=777.84s)]
*  You're trying to set the terms of the debate for the last seven days of the race [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=780.48s)]
*  You to let the press know and your supporters know and everyone out there know [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=784.4s)]
*  What is your focus on what you think the major issues are and here's your final message? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=787.36s)]
*  And when you set up like a big signal of here's my final message [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=791.0400000000001s)]
*  The next time they go cover your rally [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=793.9200000000001s)]
*  They're going to cover the part you've said is my final message as opposed to all the other stuff [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=795.6800000000001s)]
*  And so it works that way [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=799.6s)]
*  And the choice of the location I think here is very smart [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=801.28s)]
*  This is as far as I understand it's not going to be a speech about january 6th or democracy or fascism [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=803.44s)]
*  It's going to be a broader argument that probably fits more with what we're seeing in her paid advertising than what you're seeing in some [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=808.08s)]
*  of the press interactions recently that gets in the economy and [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=813.2s)]
*  Continues to define her and cutting costs and all of those things [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=816.96s)]
*  But by doing it on this location the site of donald trump's day of love [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=820.32s)]
*  Is a opportunity to remind people of the danger of donald trump [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=825.1999999999999s)]
*  It's a way to get attention from the press [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=828.24s)]
*  And I think also in this i'm sure this is not their main reason for doing it [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=830.24s)]
*  But it's going to trigger the living shit out of him [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=834.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, like you know what he's going to do. He's going to say he had a bigger crowd [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=836.72s)]
*  Of course, he's going to say he had a which is going to be very funny [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=839.36s)]
*  He's going to say it was a wonderful crowd and it was a peaceful day [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=841.92s)]
*  And I don't know what she's doing and all that kind of stuff [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=845.04s)]
*  No, look, I think the closing argument speech [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=848.4s)]
*  Is an opportunity to take your announcement speech take your convention speech and slim it down to one [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=851.1999999999999s)]
*  tight argument [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=858.4s)]
*  um and to and that speech in your final week, right where you're gonna have, you know, presumably be in front of [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=860.4s)]
*  really big rallies [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=867.1999999999999s)]
*  Um is like a pump up speech for everyone, right? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=868.8s)]
*  Like it is a signal to the press as you said that the press is going to cover it [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=871.4399999999999s)]
*  But it's also like you are literally making your final argument to voters who are tuning in some of them [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=874.3199999999999s)]
*  Some of them for the first time in the last week to see both candidates [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=879.68s)]
*  So it is a distillation of your message [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=883.12s)]
*  In the uh in the in the tightest way possible [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=885.92s)]
*  You know, there's been this debate [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=889.4399999999999s)]
*  among democratic strategists pundits about the [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=891.4399999999999s)]
*  wisdom of closing on [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=894.54s)]
*  trump's threat [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=896.8s)]
*  versus kamala's vision [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=898.4s)]
*  um, and you and I have talked about this on the pod off the pod [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=900.4s)]
*  Every day I have struggled with this in my head. This is I think it's a tough debate. Um, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=905.52s)]
*  Persuadable voters keep saying they want to know more about kamala and what kind of president she'll be [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=910.14s)]
*  Um, I get that i've been in focus groups for several years where they say they want to know more about the candidates [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=915.28s)]
*  They want to know more about the economy. What are you going to do for me kitchen table issues? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=921.76s)]
*  You hear it from voters everywhere, especially swing voters, especially persuadable voters in the swing states [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=925.36s)]
*  um, but the harris campaign [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=931.2s)]
*  Plough said this uh to puck the other day [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=933.6s)]
*  That their research shows that they need to elevate the risk [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=936.96s)]
*  of a second trump term in the minds of voters and that that is an important piece of business to get done as well as [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=941.2800000000001s)]
*  um [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=947.6800000000001s)]
*  Making sure people know who kamala is what she stands for what she'll do as president [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=948.8000000000001s)]
*  What how what do you think about this whole debate? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=953.2s)]
*  I think it's a little bit of a false debate. Do you have to do both? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=956.1600000000001s)]
*  And the harris campaign is doing both I took the opportunity this afternoon while we were waiting for donald trump to have a rally [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=959.5999999999999s)]
*  To go and look at all the ads that the harris campaign has on the air. Do you know what they are? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=965.12s)]
*  They do both things contrast ads. Yeah, they're well, they're contrast ads, but there's a lot of economy in there [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=969.92s)]
*  There is a lot of her there's a bunch of ads and if you're been watching sports last couple weeks [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=974.7199999999999s)]
*  You'll see a bunch of ads of her to camera [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=978.48s)]
*  Laying out her vision and her story and then tying it to our economic policies. There's I think only one [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=980.3199999999999s)]
*  In [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=986.16s)]
*  Totally negative ad about trump up and it's about project 2025 and the rest are here's who I am [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=987.36s)]
*  Here's what i'm gonna do. Here's what this guy's gonna do and so you have to do both and I do think it's important to [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=991.92s)]
*  Understand the media environment in which she's operating in [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=998.2199999999999s)]
*  Like it would be great if a campaign if the press and the social media conversation could [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1001.4399999999999s)]
*  ever be about her plan to cut costs [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1006.4799999999999s)]
*  And she could like walk i'm almost laughing about it because i'm trying to imagine her closing argument speech [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1009.92s)]
*  Just like at a outside a factory in pennsylvania like an exchange grocery store. She'd give it fart in the wind [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1015.52s)]
*  Like it would not they would say like, oh, yeah [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1022.4s)]
*  She's giving a speech whatever and she'd be like they said something about [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1024.48s)]
*  Uh donald trump's gonna cut taxes for rich people and she's gonna cut taxes for the middle class [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1026.72s)]
*  And then no one would fucking hear it and I bet it would test off the charts would test off the charts [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1030.48s)]
*  This is this actually this fact explains [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1036.08s)]
*  Almost everything you need to know about politics and media today [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1040.32s)]
*  Which is the issues that are most persuasive to voters [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1043.3600000000001s)]
*  Generate the least engagement for political media [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1046.72s)]
*  Yeah, because there's this giant divide between the political junkies and partisans who consume political media and the rest of the world [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1049.28s)]
*  So what drives traffic and drives ratings? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1055.68s)]
*  It is a legitimate story. I'm not criticizing it from a journalistic perspective [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1058.96s)]
*  Is donald trump's chief of staff calling him a fascist and then a big debate about whether we use the word fascist and who's a fascist? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1062.0s)]
*  And how we talk about that [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1067.52s)]
*  What gets swing voters interested is your plan to protect social security medicare to protect the affordable care act to cut taxes to cut costs [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1069.04s)]
*  And you just can't get press coverage of that. And so her choice is [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1076.96s)]
*  Talk about the things the press will cover to try and be on offense because if she's not on offense donald trump's gonna be on offense [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1080.1599999999999s)]
*  or [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1085.76s)]
*  Just do a bunch of things on the issues that poll best and get no coverage for it and let donald trump dominate the conversation with [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1086.96s)]
*  migrants eating pets [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1093.52s)]
*  Bullshit stories about gangs taking over the border or condominiums in [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1095.36s)]
*  Denver or whatever else is going on there [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1099.6s)]
*  So it's just I think the conversation is missing the the broader context of politics in media right now [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1101.6s)]
*  I mean sometimes you just have to like put all the polls down and just like use fucking common sense [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1106.72s)]
*  And when your opponent's uh former administration officials are saying that he's a fascist, you know [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1112.48s)]
*  You don't you don't respond to that by being like, you know, what's fascist these high prices these corporations that are gouging consumers [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1118.48s)]
*  That's what's fascist. Like what what the fuck are we doing? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1125.36s)]
*  This is so insane and like again [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1130.48s)]
*  I am someone who like it was obsessed with the data and the polls and the focus groups [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1133.28s)]
*  But like at some point you gotta you just you gotta say what's real to people what people are seeing in their own lives [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1137.44s)]
*  Which is when it comes to choosing between donald trump and kamala harris donald trump who is promising to do all these things [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1144.24s)]
*  Um, mike pothorzer who has been on the wilderness a lot. He's a democratic strategist [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1150.32s)]
*  Um [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1154.6599999999999s)]
*  Is very steeped in the research and and focus groups and all that he he made a really good point in one of his uh newsletters [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1155.86s)]
*  which is [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1162.1799999999998s)]
*  Everyone always says well the reason you don't talk about trump is because everyone's already made up their mind about trump [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1163.54s)]
*  People know everything there is to know about donald trump [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1167.54s)]
*  And he argues that may be true about trump the person and trump's character [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1171.2199999999998s)]
*  He goes, but what people don't know [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1176.02s)]
*  Is the sort of threat level their their consciousness about the threat that trump poses [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1178.74s)]
*  Sort of changes from time to time because not everyone's paying attention to everything [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1184.26s)]
*  He says because he says so much bullshit all the time [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1188.34s)]
*  He you know, there's chaos and drama around him all the time [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1190.74s)]
*  and so [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1194.1s)]
*  What you need to do is sort of elevate the risk of a trump second term with new information about donald trump and what he's going to do [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1195.1399999999999s)]
*  That doesn't mean you just yell about trump orange man bad, right? Like that's [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1202.98s)]
*  We get it people people have made up their mind about donald trump the person [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1207.06s)]
*  But what donald trump might do is still very much up for grabs [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1210.34s)]
*  And he also makes the point [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1214.34s)]
*  If when you look back at the last couple elections if only the people who voted in 2016 [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1216.02s)]
*  voted in 2020 [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1221.6999999999998s)]
*  Some of them switched from trump to biden, but biden would still lose the electoral college [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1223.78s)]
*  If that was the only electorate you had biden wins in 2020 because of irregular voters [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1227.78s)]
*  Uh, you know low propensity sporadic voters, whatever you want to call them who sat out in 2016 [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1234.02s)]
*  And then came back into the electorate in 2020 and those voters were far more likely to say that the reason they came out in 2020 [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1239.94s)]
*  Uh was to stop trump not to support biden, right? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1247.54s)]
*  And so there are these he calls these like an anti-maga coalition [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1251.22s)]
*  There are these voters who don't tend to vote in every election [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1254.5s)]
*  But they have come out in 18 and 20 and 22 to vote against donald trump [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1257.7s)]
*  some of them might be [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1263.3s)]
*  Independent some of them might be republicans some of them might be just democrats who don't vote all the time [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1264.8s)]
*  and [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1269.0600000000002s)]
*  Those people right now [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1270.1000000000001s)]
*  Um are like a lot of them are maybe harris voters, right? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1272.18s)]
*  She hasn't locked in that whole coalition yet [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1276.26s)]
*  But what they'll need is a reminder that the threat of a trump second term is very real and very dangerous [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1278.3400000000001s)]
*  And I think that's what the campaign is doing [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1284.66s)]
*  Even as they're also [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1286.98s)]
*  Having a bunch of ads and having her say like what who she is and what she's for right? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1288.74s)]
*  Like they have to define her too, but you gotta walk and chew gum at the same time. You gotta do both [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1292.5s)]
*  The only campaign in recent history that only does one thing is the 2020 20 is the 2024 trump campaign [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1297.5400000000002s)]
*  Which only runs negative ads about comal harris, right? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1304.42s)]
*  Almost every other campaign like we just have such short fucking memories in this country [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1306.9s)]
*  Every campaign has a positive message and a negative message at the end. It's not it's not bizarre [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1310.98s)]
*  They're doing both you don't have to pick between them [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1315.78s)]
*  Especially when you have all the money they have you can run all the ads you want you can do the things you want [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1318.18s)]
*  And so it's like I get all the concerns about this the debate about it, you know [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1322.1799999999998s)]
*  What she emphasizes in her speech will be interesting. Um, but you have to do both. Yeah [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1327.3s)]
*  and it look the real challenge too is coming up with a story that kind of connects everything because [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1332.9799999999998s)]
*  when you go from the threat of a second trump term and you're talking about him like wanting to like shoot protesters and [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1339.62s)]
*  Uh, you know shred the constitution and then you're like, but he also wants to give a big tax cut to rich people [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1346.1799999999998s)]
*  It is it's it's hard to fit it all into a story [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1352.26s)]
*  But I do think to your earlier point though, like he's going to be in [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1354.26s)]
*  Uh, he's going to be sitting in the oval office [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1358.4199999999998s)]
*  Focused on his enemies list and i'm going to be focused on a to-do list of things to get done for the american people [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1360.82s)]
*  I think like that is the best contrast that sort of brings it all together [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1365.9399999999998s)]
*  Um, another possible side effect to focusing on how dangerous trump is is that it's a pretty serious tone [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1369.1399999999999s)]
*  Uh, it's certainly different from the the joy [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1374.74s)]
*  Uh the from from bratt summer [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1377.54s)]
*  Uh, the days [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1380.5s)]
*  I know right [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1382.5s)]
*  Do you think is there a way is there a need to revive that feeling in the final two weeks or is it? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1383.7s)]
*  Uh, can you do both? What do you think you can absolutely do both because [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1388.9s)]
*  You can paint a picture because the flip side another way of thinking about the message of joy is hope [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1394.5800000000002s)]
*  and like this is a [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1401.06s)]
*  Righteous cause the combo harris this campaign and the entire movement of people working to defeat donald trump are on [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1403.22s)]
*  And it is to turn the page on a very dark era personified by this very dark and dangerous person [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1408.42s)]
*  And to paint a picture of what that looks like right what the new way forward looks like [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1413.78s)]
*  Imagine what it would be like if kamala harris is sitting in the oval office, right? [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1417.38s)]
*  And donald trump has has lost the election and then a few weeks after losing election has to show up in manhattan for his criminal [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1421.38s)]
*  sentencing, right? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1427.54s)]
*  I think I think I think you can be helpful and to me that is an even easier turn to make right because after you talk about [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1429.54s)]
*  It's like she can say we don't have to live this way, right? [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1436.42s)]
*  Like we do not have to let politicians like donald trump divide us and make us afraid of each other all the time [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1439.94s)]
*  And make us angry at each other all the time [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1446.02s)]
*  Just so he can take power for himself [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1448.5800000000002s)]
*  And help himself and his rich friends and like we we can turn the page on all that in one week [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1451.7s)]
*  We can turn the page on all that we can we can defend our freedoms [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1456.98s)]
*  We can defend [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1460.5s)]
*  opportunity and equal treatment under the law and we can get back to the business of like working together and [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1461.92s)]
*  Reaching out to actually do things for people to make their lives better [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1467.6200000000001s)]
*  Which is what he and maga politicians have prevented us from doing [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1471.54s)]
*  For even when joe biden was president for the last four years, right? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1475.78s)]
*  And so like I think you can definitely end on a note of hope there and it's I don't think it's discordant at all [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1479.7s)]
*  um [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1484.8200000000002s)]
*  Speaking of joy, we got bianca headlining a harris rally in her hometown of uh, houston tonight [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1485.46s)]
*  We also had bruce springsteen and tyler perry appearing with harris and barack obama on thursday night in atlanta [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1490.66s)]
*  Usher did a harris rally in atlanta as well james taylor played a set at a tim's walls rally in north carolina [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1496.18s)]
*  Uh leaving obama aside just having the time of his life out there. Uh, she sure is just just [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1502.5800000000002s)]
*  Wrapping lose yourself [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1508.9s)]
*  Uh, what's the value do you think of these uh, big celebrity events? [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1511.94s)]
*  It's attention, right? [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1514.98s)]
*  Like it is impossible to get attention in this totally fucked up media environment [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1516.1000000000001s)]
*  Particularly when you're running against someone like donald trump who? [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1519.14s)]
*  Is a reality star attention monger plus because of all the anticipation that bianca was gonna make a surprise appearance at the convention [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1522.0200000000002s)]
*  Like this is the one people have been waiting for you know, more people pay attention [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1528.3400000000001s)]
*  The clips will go more viral and tick tock people will see it [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1531.7s)]
*  You'll get a bigger crowd which matters a lot in these battleground states because you might especially with these musicians [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1534.74s)]
*  Uh, you might get people who wouldn't otherwise come to a rally because they want to hear bianca play a song or hear [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1540.3400000000001s)]
*  bruce springsteen play a song and those are people who may be [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1545.38s)]

*  And then you just hope in the 15 seconds you have of voters attention. You can deliver a message that will persuade them [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1562.5s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like it's going to be an organizing tool as well, right? [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1568.9s)]
*  Because if those extra people come then you can get more volunteers you can sign people up. Um, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1571.46s)]

*  I knew that happened. I don't think i've heard the whole clip. I was not quite prepared [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1694.66s)]
*  for that [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1699.38s)]
*  Vigorous spanking that tucker carlson is very very excited about [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1700.9s)]
*  Enthusiastic about he's thought about that one for a while [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1706.24s)]
*  Yeah [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1709.8600000000001s)]

*  He wants america to call donald trump daddy, what was that what was that just to trigger libs [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1719.54s)]
*  Was that to just play out his weird fantasy? What the fuck was that? I think his brain is broken [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1727.3s)]
*  I don't know. It's a say. I don't think there's a strategy. I think it's a message [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1733.78s)]
*  I don't think it's just to trigger libs. There are many ways to do that. That's less fucking weird than that was like this [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1736.34s)]
*  Tim walsh needed more evidence for his performance a weird message just there you go [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1742.42s)]
*  I mean [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1747.06s)]
*  What a closing argument [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1748.02s)]
*  trump daddy's home now. We're all getting a spanking [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1750.02s)]
*  daddy will [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1754.18s)]
*  So that was smart dan was like i'm not gonna say it because they're gonna clip me out of context [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1759.7s)]
*  And post it i can't see i know what it's gonna say yes [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1764.44s)]
*  All right, I we just had to play that one trump himself was in arizona on thursday where his campaign said [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1770.12s)]
*  He'd be previewing his closing message with voters. Uh, they describe that closing message as harris broke it trump will fix it [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1775.24s)]
*  Um his campaign sent out excerpts that say my message today is simple camila's migrant invasion disqualifies her from the presidency [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1783.3999999999999s)]
*  Uh, he started speaking right as right before we recording. He did say that he looks like he's like staying on prompter [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1791.56s)]
*  more than usual [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1798.4399999999998s)]
*  but um [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1799.8799999999999s)]
*  You know, we did get some of this a lot of people coming out of the congo not just south america. They're coming from [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1801.08s)]
*  181 countries as of yesterday [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1808.74s)]
*  Right, and we're a dumping ground. We're like a we're like a garbage can for the world [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1812.36s)]
*  That's what's happened that's what's happened to a we're like a garbage can [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1817.96s)]
*  You know, it's the first time i've ever said that [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1824.68s)]
*  And every time I come up and talk about what they've done to a country I get angry and angrier [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1827.24s)]
*  First time i've ever said garbage can but you know what it's a very accurate description [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1833.0s)]
*  Speaking of hope and joy [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1838.68s)]
*  What do we think of uh [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1841.8s)]
*  Donald trump trying to have a closing argument in a closing message, which is [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1843.64s)]
*  Harris broke it trump will fix it. They say we're offering people something to vote for not just vote against that's what the campaign has been saying [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1847.88s)]
*  I think that's probably a little bit of a stretch there. I mean, it's not it's not the the basic framework [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1854.68s)]
*  Is [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1861.48s)]
*  Fine, I guess I just don't think that people believe that camila harris broke it. Yeah [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1862.76s)]
*  That's just not we've seen none of that in the research that they hold her personally accountable for [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1868.76s)]
*  Things they don't like in american policy right now whether it's inflation or immigration now [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1874.52s)]
*  They have had some traction making the case that she's not the best person to change it because she's so closely associated with the biden administration [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1879.24s)]
*  But this idea that she personally opened the doors to make america a trash can is that's not believable. I know and it's like [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1886.12s)]
*  You're right like with just a little not that they do subtlety or nuance [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1893.96s)]
*  Well, but with just a little subtlety and nuance you could make the argument like well [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1897.48s)]
*  You say that biden did this well, you were right there as vice president [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1901.48s)]
*  Why didn't you tell him not to right? Like they they just skipped right over that they were like [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1903.8799999999999s)]
*  She was president for the last four years and she did all these things which I think is just I don't know [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1907.72s)]
*  It's sort of a sort of a lazier version of it, but they can't help themselves [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1911.8799999999999s)]
*  you know for [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1916.6s)]
*  My youtube show political experts react heard of it. I watched all these trump ads, right? [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1918.44s)]
*  And this has been and i've been doing this show for four years now [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1923.4s)]
*  And this is true of all the trump mostly republican ads now just because they're everyone's been trump-pilled [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1926.8400000000001s)]
*  It's just they can't ever use a scalpel. It's always just a giant slasher. So there's like a good [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1931.8s)]
*  Effective worrisome message buried in there, but they're just like two broken brains or [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1938.3600000000001s)]
*  Want to be testosterone filled to actually do that and so they just like way overshoot the runway every so time and this is [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1943.96s)]
*  Emblematic of that trend well, I'm guessing that their strategy in the home stretch over the last month has just been to drive [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1950.02s)]
*  kamala harris's negatives up [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1957.08s)]
*  Uh as much as they possibly can to just try to disqualify her so that trump becomes the better choice [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1959.32s)]
*  Um on you know an issue like the economy or immigration [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1967.32s)]
*  And that's what they did with Hillary. Yeah, there was marco puto at the bulwark had a piece today on [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1971.32s)]
*  How much the trump campaign has spent on these anti-trans ads about 26 million dollars [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1976.52s)]
*  Yeah [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1982.36s)]
*  And then the next like five million was the next issue and that was the economy five million versus 26 29 million on anti-trans ads [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1982.76s)]
*  and [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1990.4399999999998s)]
*  you know, I do think part of those ads, you know, which is about like her [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1991.24s)]
*  saying that you know that the [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1997.48s)]
*  Inmates should get be able to get transition surgery [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=1999.88s)]
*  Uh, and even if they're undocumented or whatever, uh, bullshit thing [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2004.2s)]
*  There is is you know, they end that ad with kamala's not for you. She's for they them right which I think is not [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2007.96s)]
*  You know in in the in the immediate instance is about [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2014.1200000000001s)]
*  Trans issues but more broadly what they're trying to do there is just say like she's not for you. She's for someone else [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2017.96s)]
*  Um, which is which is a which is a message [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2024.6s)]
*  That trump and republicans have used about democrats and republicans use of democrats for decades, right? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2027.8s)]
*  Like they're always trying to tell you democrats [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2033.3999999999999s)]
*  They they're not for you. They're for just the poor or therefore [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2035.6399999999999s)]
*  Uh black americans or latino americans or immigrants or gay people or trans people right? [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2039.8s)]
*  Like and so you're hard working you're a hard working person and you pay your taxes and you're trying to get ahead and the democrats [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2045.8s)]
*  Just want to give all that to someone else and they have just been and basically they told mark computer their strategy is to just [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2052.52s)]
*  Just tear her down [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2058.28s)]
*  Make people think that she's not for them and that she's weak and that trump will be the best alternative and like who knows [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2060.04s)]
*  You know, I guess if he if he wins, well, we'll see that it works. But um, but that's clearly the strategy there [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2065.4s)]
*  I mean this [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2071.56s)]
*  Question right here is the hinge point of every american election [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2072.84s)]
*  Yeah, since the 80s with the possible exception of 2004 which is [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2076.2s)]
*  It's all a question about who's fighting for who right and republicans want to make democrats look like they're fighting for poor people [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2080.76s)]
*  Immigrants people on welfare the 47 percent and mitt romney's parlance and democrats want to show republicans be fighting for [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2087.62s)]
*  Rich people and corporations and whoever wins that argument tends to win the election [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2095.4s)]
*  Yeah [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2101.64s)]
*  Uh, so after a lot of uh will he or won't he speculation trump's also sitting down with joe rogan for an interview? [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2102.6s)]
*  Uh in texas on friday [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2109.48s)]
*  Uh, obviously trump's been doing a tour of the uh, manosphere podcasts. So in some ways obvious move [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2111.8799999999997s)]
*  But rogan's also criticized trump in the past [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2117.7999999999997s)]
*  Uh any risks here? [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2120.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean it is funny that trump has finally made himself to the final boss of the manosphere podcast [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2123.08s)]
*  He's just he's got you got you got to defeat theovon and andrew schultz and the milk boys and then you can finally get to [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2128.12s)]
*  Joe rogan. Yeah, I think there's tons of risk here. I mean rogan is [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2134.12s)]
*  The kind of interviewer where trump could get himself in a lot of trouble because it's really he doesn't [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2139.16s)]
*  He doesn't ask it's not that he asks hard questions. It's really a very [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2144.44s)]
*  Meandering conversation about what's going through jr rogan's mind at the time. It's a lot of [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2149.46s)]
*  Runway for trump to uh run into something or make mistakes [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2154.52s)]
*  I'll be very interested to see how rogan handles this because he has been critical of trump [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2157.48s)]
*  He [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2161.0s)]
*  Has he has pushed back on the idea that he's supporting trump. He's obviously not a fan of kamala harris or joe biden [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2162.2s)]
*  So i'm just i'll be very interested to see this is a bit. This is a it's this is high high risk high reward for trump [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2169.3999999999996s)]
*  No question [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2174.04s)]
*  Why do you there was some there was a report a couple weeks ago that kamala harris might do rogan. What do you think happened there? [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2175.16s)]
*  It's a great question and there was a lot of speculation when she was coming to texas to do this event [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2182.3599999999997s)]
*  Uh on friday both the event with beyonce and now in the abortion speech [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2186.92s)]
*  Was that she would do rogan why either because trump is going to austin to do this [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2190.6s)]
*  I don't think rogan rogan doesn't do road games [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2193.64s)]
*  You come to his house to do it when you have when you're the largest podcast in the world [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2195.8s)]
*  you do that we would get on a fucking greyhound bus to interview someone but [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2198.84s)]
*  But not if you're jr rogan, um [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2204.52s)]
*  I don't know. I don't maybe I don't know whether he [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2207.5600000000004s)]
*  Was unwilling to do it or they couldn't come to an agreement on what on timing or what it would look like [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2210.1200000000003s)]
*  Maybe they campaign didn't want to spend [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2215.1600000000003s)]
*  You know, it's an to go to austin specifically to to spend hours and hours doing [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2217.6400000000003s)]
*  This interview [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2222.6000000000004s)]
*  I mean for her maybe she's gonna surprise trump. She's gonna show up to show up. Yeah, that would be very I mean [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2223.96s)]
*  Joe rogan loves professional wrestling and so her coming in like busting through the door like macho band savage [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2230.6000000000004s)]

*  uh anyway [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2245.2400000000002s)]
*  Uh, and also it's like what this is the final week do the big rallies get everyone excited [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2246.76s)]

*  Yeah, thanks for having me on tommy. I appreciate you [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2378.38s)]
*  Uh, it's great to talk to you as always. Um, so we're just a couple weeks out from the election [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2380.6200000000003s)]
*  The polls have you within single digits of ted cruise. It's very close this year [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2384.86s)]
*  Um, how does a democrat win in texas in a presidential year? [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2388.94s)]
*  Are you focused on sort of base turnout at this point? Are you thinking about getting voters to split their ticket and go? [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2391.9s)]
*  You know trump all red. How are you thinking about winning? Yeah. Well, you know, it's just a different race [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2398.06s)]
*  Than the presidential ticket and I think texans see it that way [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2404.62s)]
*  And i'm a different candidate obviously and and ted cruises too [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2408.54s)]
*  You know, this is somebody who you know went to cancun when we needed him most [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2412.78s)]
*  Who is responsible for taking down, you know a border bill who's responsible for the abortion ban that we have here in texas [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2417.7400000000002s)]
*  And who has spent his time for 12 years putting texans against each other [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2425.82s)]
*  And so, you know as a fourth generation texan somebody who you know [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2429.82s)]
*  Was raised by a single mom in dallas. It's captain the football team at baylor [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2433.26s)]
*  Trained for the draft in houston his grandmothers from brownsville [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2437.1000000000004s)]
*  I think I have a pretty good take on who we are as texans [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2439.74s)]
*  And the thing is is that ted cruises is just too small for our state [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2443.9s)]
*  And his vision is too small [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2447.1s)]
*  His view for what we can be is too small. We're a state big ideas of getting big things done [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2449.34s)]
*  That's what i've done in my time in congress and you know [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2455.98s)]
*  I know that obviously the presidential race is going at the same time, but they are two very distinct decisions [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2458.7s)]
*  I think that's what we're going to see on november 5th [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2463.74s)]
*  You uh, you recently had the the joy of debating ted cruis. I just watched it. Uh, you worked him over pretty hard [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2466.22s)]
*  Here's a little taste of that debate for the listeners. We did a super cut [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2472.54s)]
*  But time and again senator cruis treats our border communities like he's going on some kind of a safari [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2476.62s)]
*  He comes down he puts on his outdoor clothes [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2481.2599999999998s)]
*  He tries to look tough and he goes back to washington and does nothing to help because ivf didn't need protecting until he got [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2483.9799999999996s)]
*  His way of going after it [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2490.8599999999997s)]
*  No one was thinking that we needed to protect ivf [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2492.8599999999997s)]
*  So to every texas woman at home and every texas family watching this understand that when ted cruis says he's pro-life [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2495.42s)]
*  He doesn't mean yours. You can't be for the mob on january 6th and for the officers you can't and it's not funny [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2501.26s)]
*  Because you're a threat to democracy [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2507.98s)]
*  Uh, that was satisfying for me to listen to was it satisfying for you on stage or did you secretly want to line them up? [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2509.98s)]
*  And do a little oklahoma drill for old time's sake [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2515.58s)]
*  Yeah, i've had a lot of texans who told me that they thought they wish that I had done that [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2518.78s)]
*  Um, but you know listen, I he's supposed to be the champion debater, right? Uh, he was a princeton debate team [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2523.1800000000003s)]
*  I was just you know, uh a football player [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2529.7400000000002s)]
*  But you know, I think we roughed him up, uh, pretty good there and you know, honestly, it's just stuff that he's done [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2533.1000000000004s)]
*  You know and his record is indefensible and that he's tried to now in an election year completely change [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2538.46s)]
*  His entire personality for 12 years. He's been like this proud extremist [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2545.1000000000004s)]
*  And you know, you almost would respect it more if you just ran on that right? [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2549.42s)]
*  Um, but instead to try and you know pretend like as he was in the debate, you know, for example that he wants to defend ivf [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2553.34s)]
*  No, you're responsible for why ivf is at risk, right? [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2559.26s)]
*  or uh to talk about when we're talking about january 6th, you know, that was one where you know, I I really uh, [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2562.94s)]
*  It made me angry when he started laughing [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2570.0600000000004s)]
*  Uh, you know during my answer [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2573.6600000000003s)]
*  Because you know there was a mob [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2575.8199999999997s)]
*  On the 6th and it did storm the capital and it came there because of folks like ted cruise who lied [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2578.22s)]
*  And so the election was stolen who objected to the results in arizona [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2584.94s)]
*  Who was the architect of the plan to overturn that election? [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2588.94s)]
*  And when that mob came and when I took off my suit jacket and was ready to defend my colleagues on the house floor [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2591.8999999999996s)]
*  He was hiding in a supply closet [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2597.8199999999997s)]
*  So this brings me back to my point he's too small for texas [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2600.1400000000003s)]
*  And I felt that way in the debate. He was shouting as he always does [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2604.06s)]
*  You know, he's kind of looked like he was pretty uncomfortable [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2608.54s)]
*  Uh, and you know, it was it was a lot of fun for me [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2611.9s)]
*  And I don't think it was very fun for a lot of texas. I would have to listen to him for an hour [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2615.98s)]
*  No, it's not fun at all. Uh, I did one thing about debates [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2619.5s)]
*  I mean michelle obama famously said when they go low we go high but in football the low man wins [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2622.7000000000003s)]
*  What do you make of that? That's right [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2627.58s)]
*  Well, listen, I was not gonna go in there and not call him out on his nonsense, you know [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2629.6600000000003s)]
*  And I don't think that's being negative. It's just what he's been doing. No, you just literally talked about his record [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2635.34s)]
*  Uh, there's been a lot of consternation among democrats myself included [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2639.82s)]
*  About you know losing badly with young men [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2643.58s)]
*  You and I talked about this challenge a year ago when you were here in la [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2647.58s)]
*  Have you seen that slippage in your race and how have you been trying to convince younger men that the democratic under? [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2650.3s)]
*  Democratic party understands them and cares about them. Yeah [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2656.14s)]
*  well, listen, it's been a focus of mine and you know, I think it's something that [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2660.46s)]
*  We do have to talk about and focus on you have to have policies that are you know, kind of [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2665.2599999999998s)]
*  Geared towards young men, which I think is often around opportunity around making sure that folks have a chance [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2671.66s)]
*  To take care of their families that when we're talking about the economy that we're talking about building an economy where you know [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2677.9s)]
*  Work is respected and rewarded [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2684.06s)]
*  But then also there's I think you know kind of a longing for an authenticity [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2686.78s)]
*  and somebody who understands, you know that [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2692.46s)]
*  What's what young men are going through and that can speak to that, you know with with some authenticity [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2696.54s)]
*  I think you know coach walsh for example does that and I think you know for me with my background [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2701.26s)]
*  I try and do that as well to say listen, you know, I've played [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2706.54s)]
*  You know football in college and the nfl I spent my career, you know [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2710.46s)]
*  You know working in these contexts [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2716.22s)]
*  Where we have to find a way as men to get things done and to put aside our differences [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2719.42s)]
*  And to work on a team and to accomplish a goal and to show leadership and to show that there's something larger than yourself [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2724.22s)]
*  And to be a part of an effort, you know, that is something larger than yourself [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2729.9s)]
*  And that I think is something that has helped but I also think that there is a very shallow [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2733.74s)]
*  uh very [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2738.46s)]
*  A weak version of masculinity that folks like ted cruise try to pitch which is one that's based on fear [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2739.98s)]
*  Of women doing well or fear or or resentment? [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2745.9s)]
*  Of someone else doing well [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2749.58s)]
*  And and then trying to appeal to these kind of you know, most negative instincts and so we have to compete with that [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2751.82s)]
*  But I don't think we compete with it by being who they are [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2757.7400000000002s)]
*  I think we compete with it by presenting a more positive vision of what we can do. Yeah, I've agreed [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2759.82s)]
*  We're recording this on wednesday october 23rd [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2764.94s)]
*  Vice president kamala harris is coming to texas in two days on friday for an event focused on abortion and reproductive health care [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2768.14s)]
*  Normally the you know, the democratic presidential nominee doesn't campaign in texas this close to election day [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2775.42s)]
*  Why do you think she's making this trip now and what do you expect that you guys will talk about? [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2781.5s)]
*  Well, because what's happening in texas with this abortion ban? [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2785.42s)]
*  Is nothing short of a tragedy? [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2789.42s)]
*  And it is ted cruz's fault [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2791.18s)]
*  And we have all these harrowing stories [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2793.98s)]
*  uh that folks saw at the dnc [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2797.18s)]
*  Uh that they see in commercials around the country, but many of them are my friends. They're texas women [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2800.22s)]
*  There are these texas women who come forward and you know used as you know, tommy one of the most difficult moments in their life [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2807.66s)]
*  They've taken that you know that grief and that anger that they felt about it and they've turned it into action and they are inspiring [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2816.06s)]
*  They're inspiring me every single day, which is an event last night [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2822.2999999999997s)]
*  With connie britain and with lauren miller who uh is a friend of mine [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2825.8199999999997s)]
*  Eight generation texan who had to leave the state to get the care she needed and kate cox who has been [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2829.18s)]
*  Become basically at this point a national figure kate's a good friend of mine as well [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2834.06s)]
*  We did that last night, you know talking about this [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2837.3399999999997s)]
*  And so that's well, that's what we're going to be doing is talking about on the national stage [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2840.54s)]
*  What has happened in texas how folks like ted cruz want to do this around the country? [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2845.2599999999998s)]
*  And I think it's important that texas women and texas stories are told on that stage [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2850.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I think I think it's really important [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2855.6600000000003s)]
*  I commend you and I commend the vice president for talking about this. Um is someone who [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2857.34s)]
*  My wife and I experienced a lot of pregnancy loss including a you know, stillborn baby at six months [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2861.26s)]
*  And if someone had told us, you know to go home and wait a while and you know [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2865.1800000000003s)]
*  See if she met some threshold for this being a life-threatening illness [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2869.26s)]
*  I think I would have walked out of that hospital room in handcuffs [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2873.42s)]
*  Because you know, you don't want to hear someone put your spouse in a position like that [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2876.62s)]
*  um switching gears I was just watching kamala harris before he came in she was doing a [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2880.62s)]
*  Press statement about recent comments by john kelly [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2885.98s)]
*  Who's the four-star general who later worked as trump's chief of staff who said trump quote falls into the definition of a fascist? [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2889.18s)]
*  That comes after mark milley the former chairman of the joint chiefs under trump and then biden [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2896.38s)]
*  Told bob woodward that trump was quote fascist to the core now. I understand [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2901.1s)]
*  I mean, I sit in a million focus groups and read a lot of polls and I know [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2905.42s)]
*  Voters care about the basics paying their bills access to health care social security, but it's also [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2909.98s)]
*  Chilling to your core to hear the people closest to trump who worked with him day in and day out [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2917.1800000000003s)]
*  Talk about him this way [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2923.66s)]
*  How do you think democrats what do we do with this information? [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2925.42s)]
*  Should it be part of our day-to-day message or is this a distraction from you know economic issues and abortion? [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2928.46s)]
*  How are you thinking about it? You know, certainly with ted cruise I talk about january 6th [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2934.86s)]
*  And and I talk about what his role was in that I talk about how he was hiding [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2939.1800000000003s)]
*  When the mob came because he was and I also say that i'm glad he was safe that day [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2944.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and that this election is his accountability, right? [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2949.7400000000002s)]
*  And to me we have to talk about all of it [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2953.6600000000003s)]
*  And you know voters are you know incredibly complicated. I was you know campaigning here with lish cheney [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2956.3s)]
*  Uh in in dallas, uh, and you know liz is involved in this race because you know [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2963.2599999999998s)]
*  She knows that ted cruise is a threat to democracy [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2968.38s)]
*  And she and I you know, we're already friends [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2971.02s)]
*  But we formed and we really forged a closer relationship on january 6th and the days thereafter [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2973.1s)]
*  Because of her clear-eyed view that we had to have a response to this and accountability for it [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2979.02s)]
*  And so to me this election is about that. It's about a lot of things. It's about freedom restoring [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2984.7799999999997s)]
*  What's right to choose particularly here in texas? [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2989.66s)]
*  It's about opportunity and who has a better plan to make sure that you and your family can get ahead [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2992.14s)]
*  You know, we we know that costs are still too high as somebody was raised by a single mother who struggled [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=2997.58s)]
*  Growing up here in dallas. I'm laser focused on that [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3002.46s)]
*  You think the guy who goes to cancun and ted cruises, you know, who's in the ritz-carlton? I don't think so, right? [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3005.18s)]
*  And it's also about accountability [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3010.3799999999997s)]
*  And I think it's also about the threat that we face that if we have [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3012.22s)]
*  You know someone who doesn't respect [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3017.2599999999998s)]
*  Our constitution in positions of high office [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3019.42s)]
*  And so I do think that we have to talk about it all and I don't think that you can ignore it [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3022.46s)]
*  I don't I also certainly don't think that it can be the only pitch right it has to be everything. Yeah [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3026.46s)]
*  Listen my uh, my new england patriots stink, but uh, that does not stop me from talking about football [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3032.94s)]
*  Football is playing a fun and bigger role in this year's election [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3039.5s)]
*  So governor tim walsh the vice presidential nominee was a defensive coordinator for a state champion high school team in minnesota [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3043.1s)]
*  When I interviewed him back in february here in in the office [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3050.7000000000003s)]
*  He I said what defense did he run? [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3054.7000000000003s)]
*  He told me he ran a four four defense his guys were focused on reading guards for for non football fans [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3056.06s)]
*  Out there a four four defense is a type of alignment where you have four down linemen [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3061.7400000000002s)]
*  Like the big boys in the three-point stance and then four linebackers [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3066.2200000000003s)]
*  Which are the slightly less big guys who are faster that be the position colin played in the nfl and in college [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3070.14s)]
*  max brown a former qb for usc in pittsburgh turned uh sports commentator saw a clip of that interview [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3077.02s)]
*  And he threw down the gauntlet for how he would torch tim walsh's defense. Let's listen to a little clip of that [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3084.54s)]
*  And tim tim here's how we're gonna put you in a blender in your four four defense [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3091.6600000000003s)]
*  You put your corners in an absolute bind you're packing the box [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3095.26s)]
*  We're gonna rpo your ass right from the jump fake the run here this linebacker on the outside [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3097.98s)]
*  He cannot be right. He plays the run. We'll kick it out to the bubble by the f [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3102.46s)]
*  He plays the f on the bubble. We got a slant right behind him [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3105.98s)]
*  We're gonna run this until we get tired and then from there we're going four verts [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3108.3s)]
*  So you got two linebackers right here trying to run with my guys vertically in the slot with a single high safety [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3111.82s)]
*  We are going to work these seams find the mismatch and exploit it all day long. Okay, that's just part of it [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3116.3s)]
*  It was a great video. Uh colin you played in the nfl [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3121.26s)]
*  You know defense you're the captain right of the bailer team. Yeah [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3124.46s)]
*  What halftime adjustments would you make to max's scheme there? How are we how are we pushing back? Okay, so here's the thing [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3128.1400000000003s)]
*  In the nfl we match personnel, okay [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3135.26s)]
*  So what max is talking about you wouldn't have a four four defense on the field when you got three receivers [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3138.7000000000003s)]
*  On the offense, right? You wouldn't have four linebackers out there. We'd be in a nickel, right? [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3144.62s)]
*  Right, so we got to adjust to go to nickel. What's a nickel for everybody listening? Okay, it's four down linemen [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3148.46s)]
*  Two linebackers five dbs, okay five dbs. So the dbs are the fast guys, right? [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3154.38s)]
*  So and if nickel's not working then we'll get into a dime. We'll have one linebacker and six [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3159.58s)]
*  Dbs, but you know what and when we're in that nickel we're going to blitz the heck out of you, right? [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3164.78s)]
*  Okay, we're not and we're going to we're going to disguise the blitz [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3168.54s)]
*  You're never going to know what we're in and on one side of the field [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3170.94s)]
*  We're going to be in one coverage and the other side of the field we're going to be on different coverage [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3173.42s)]
*  So you have two different reads and so your young quarterback is not going to know what's happening [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3176.06s)]
*  And by the time he figures it out, we're going to hit him [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3180.06s)]
*  And that's how we're going to make sure we put you in a blender. That's right max [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3181.98s)]
*  We're going to blitz your ass all day long, buddy. I hope you see this on social media and respond [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3185.02s)]
*  One more football question dallas cowboys are three and three is dak press. God's still the guy [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3189.98s)]
*  That's the guy that's not the issue quite honestly [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3195.02s)]
*  They gotta stop the run and as a linebacker [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3196.94s)]
*  I always come back to the trenches like if you can't stop the run and run the ball ultimately you're going to get exposed [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3199.5s)]
*  So it's not it's not on dag [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3204.78s)]
*  The quarterbacks get too much credit and they get too much of blame [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3206.54s)]
*  So sometimes you got to have big boys in the trenches who are moving people around right and and that's really how you win football games [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3210.14s)]
*  And you got some injuries, right? I mean michael parsons has been out [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3216.46s)]
*  Um, he's you know, one of the best athletes on the field [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3219.1s)]
*  In anything he might be the second coming of lawrence taylor. Yeah, that's right [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3222.3799999999997s)]
*  He really is one of those guys like him and like aiden hutchinson [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3226.94s)]
*  You look at them and their motor on the field and they do not slow down for a single second of any snap [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3230.22s)]
*  And they're also so fast. I mean these guys are like [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3235.18s)]
*  Six four, you know 280 they're dropping in coverage. They're doing everything on the field. Unbelievable. Yeah, tj [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3237.7400000000002s)]
*  What's up? They're getting interceptions and taking effort to stay on [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3243.42s)]
*  I saw I was at the steelers facility once like last year two years ago [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3247.26s)]
*  Tj watt walked by me and I was like that's not a person that that is not a species that i've ever seen [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3250.78s)]
*  Um a last dumb question for you two two questions one dumb one not do you think you have the fastest 40 time in congress? [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3256.86s)]

*  Ohio state and indy was there I did not because he ran I think four four [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3269.18s)]
*  And he was first round pick but he's gone now. So I think I probably do [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQOzZpUL0c&t=3274.54s)]
