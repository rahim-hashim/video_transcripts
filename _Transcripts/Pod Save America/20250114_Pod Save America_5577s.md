Video Description: Devastating wildfires in Los Angeles prompt a round of angry finger-pointing and disaster politics from the GOP. The most extreme reaction comes from Trump and a growing number of Republicans in Congress, who are already talking about placing conditions on disaster relief for California. Meanwhile, President Biden kicks off his final week in office with a farewell speech defending his foreign policy legacy. Jon, Lovett, and Tommy break down what he got right, and what’s at risk as Trump returns to D.C. On another front, MAGA’s messy relationship with Big Tech heats up. Zuckerberg sits down with Trump on Joe Rogan, while Steve Bannon takes aim at Elon Musk. Finally, Ken Martin, Chair the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, drops by to talk about his campaign for Chair of the Democratic National Committee.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Republicans Tried To Cancel Us For Raising Money for California Wild Fire Aid
**Pod Save America:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY)
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Jon Favreau. I'm Jon Lovett. I'm Tommy Vitor. Cool. On today's show [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=0.0s)]
*  Joe Biden delivers his final foreign policy address to kick off his last week as president [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  We'll talk about the speech and his farewell tour. I can't believe it's the last week. Don't let the door hit you with a good Lord's splitchip [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=11.08s)]
*  I miss it more of like you're gonna miss him. Oh shit Trump's coming. Yeah, it's happening. It's real [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=21.16s)]
*  We'll also talk about the latest in the precarious marriage between MAGA and Big Tech with Mark Zuckerberg doing more Trump ass-kissing on Joe Rogan [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=26.64s)]
*  And Steve Bannon making new threats to Elon Musk. Then I talked to Ken Martin chair of the Minnesota DFL [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  That's the state's Democratic Party [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  About his bid for chair of the DNC [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=42.160000000000004s)]
*  But first the fires in Los Angeles are still burning as of this taping on Monday afternoon [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=45.36s)]
*  The Eaton Palisades and Hearst fires have burned over 36,000 acres [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=50.84s)]
*  To put that in context that is a larger area than the entire city of San Francisco [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=55.419999999999995s)]
*  More than 12,000 structures have been damaged or destroyed. That's just so far that number will probably go up [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=60.58s)]
*  And the fires have taken the lives of 24 Angelenos [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=66.82s)]
*  Fortunately that number is expected to go up as well as we are recording this the winds have subsided [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=70.22s)]
*  which has allowed firefighting crews over the weekend to contain more of the blaze but [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=76.1s)]
*  Really bad powerful new winds are expected throughout the week, especially Tuesday and Wednesday creating dangerous conditions and the possibility of new fires [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=80.34s)]
*  Of course, the continued danger has not prevented Republicans from politicizing recovery efforts and spreading misinformation [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=87.94s)]
*  Such as vice president-elect JD Vance's claim on Fox News Sunday that some of Los Angeles's reservoirs have been dry for decades [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=95.14s)]
*  But the worst reaction has come from Trump and a growing number of Republicans in Congress [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=103.78s)]
*  Who are already talking about placing conditions on disaster relief sent to California? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=107.94000000000001s)]
*  Here's Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville Wyoming Senator John Barrasso [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=113.78s)]
*  Tennessee Senator Bill Haggerty and speaker Mike Johnson [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=118.18s)]
*  Why should other states be bailing out California for choosing the wrong people to run their state? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=121.54s)]
*  We shouldn't be they got 40 million people in that state and they voting these these imbeciles in office [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=127.78s)]
*  If you go to California you run into a lot of Republicans a lot of good people and I hate it for them [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=134.2s)]
*  But they are just overwhelmed by by these inner-city [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=139.39999999999998s)]
*  woke [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=143.28s)]
*  Policies with the people that vote for them [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=144.48s)]
*  They don't deserve anything to be honest with you unless they show us they're gonna make some changes and before we put funds funds into place [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=146.72s)]
*  We've got to find out exactly how we're gonna hold these leaders accountable and what sort of policy changes are required [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=153.62s)]
*  There's gonna be hearings. There's gonna be requests of Congress [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=159.12s)]
*  There can't be a blank check on this [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=162.12s)]
*  Tommy Tuberville real expert putting imbeciles into office [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=168.52s)]
*  From the state of Alabama, which I believe is the state that is its number 12 in states that are most dependent on federal aid [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=173.20000000000002s)]
*  Mm-hmm small state of Alabama compared to the 40 million people in California [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=180.32000000000002s)]
*  Which I do think contributes quite a bit to the country's gross domestic product and far more tax dollars leave [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=183.36s)]
*  California go to the federal government then come back [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=188.68s)]
*  Just so racist these inner-city woke DEI initiatives like well, what are you trying to say senator? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=190.84s)]
*  I can't tell if you really listen to the criticism. I was just listening to our our good pal Chris Christie [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=196.8s)]
*  Hmm. He was on Brian Kilmeade's [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=201.68s)]
*  radio show [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=204.3s)]
*  Going off on Newsome and the fire response. None of these people though have any [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=205.8s)]
*  They haven't really paid attention to any of the details. So they don't have any actual criticisms [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  They're just like it's a disaster and the woke policies did it in this. It's just a walk fire [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=215.52s)]
*  It's shorthand lazy bullshit and as we're gonna get into there are absolutely [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=220.08s)]
*  Real critiques that you can level towards various officials about the fire thing, but they don't they're not interested [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=224.88000000000002s)]
*  So Mike Johnson actually the next sentence that he says because he's walking on the Capitol [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=230.0s)]
*  He says I their conditions and he throws out their forest management water management. It's like, okay [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=234.16000000000003s)]
*  This is a disaster an emergency right now. California needs money right now [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=240.16000000000003s)]
*  I don't even know what it means to put conditions on California [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=244.9s)]
*  Nor does Mike Johnson or any Republican. It's like you are no more woke and you better stop doing those things [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=248.54s)]
*  We're making up about you doing all those things that aren't happening. They better stop right now [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=254.34s)]
*  We've come to expect this from Trump [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=259.38s)]
*  I do think it's alarming that Republicans are now just open to punishing disaster victims [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=260.98s)]
*  Unless the elected Democrats who represent them just embrace Republican politics [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=265.86s)]
*  Is that what we're in for for the next four years? Sure seems like it [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=271.18s)]
*  Remember there's the story from 2018 where a bunch of Trump's national security staff had to show him [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=274.2s)]
*  Vote totals from Orange County, California before he would agree to funds for fire relief [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=280.18s)]
*  Yeah, so this is not surprising for Trump [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=286.18s)]
*  I guess we shouldn't be surprised that Republicans are following suit, especially the worst of the worst like Tommy Turville [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=287.88s)]
*  But it's a problem you you would like to think that doing something like this exploiting people in an ongoing [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=293.12s)]
*  Disaster would be seen as beyond the pale or at least there'd be some kind of like mutually assured destruction lest the next [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=299.84s)]
*  Democratic president say actually no one should live on the coast of Florida ever again [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=305.85999999999996s)]
*  And unless you agree to my random policy areas, we will not fund any insurance for you [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=310.26s)]
*  Yeah, of course when did Joe Biden ever attach political conditions to disaster relief or? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=315.76s)]
*  Barack Obama or George W. Bush or like any president before Donald Trump in addition to that 2018 episode [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=322.4s)]
*  I forgot I had forgotten that in October of 2020 [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=328.12s)]
*  Trump did deny a federal aid request from California at the time [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=331.6s)]
*  there were 21 active wildfires in the state 4 million acres had already burned 31 people had died and [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=335.24s)]
*  Newsom had asked for federal aid Trump rejected it and then [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=340.78s)]
*  Newsom called Trump and and pleaded his case and I think Kevin McCarthy who at the time was you know [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=345.64s)]
*  Republican leadership in the house and from California [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=351.4s)]
*  I think he got Trump to turn around and then Trump signed the signed the disaster relief assistance, but he tried to do this before [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=353.62s)]
*  Yeah, I mean look there are Republican members of Congress in California [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=360.34000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, nine husk Republicans. They better speak up [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=365.04s)]
*  There are it is especially galling when you see like different people like DeSantis [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=367.18s)]
*  But a bunch of them that have called for conditioning aid to Democratic areas on either side of their state desperately needing aid [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=371.36s)]
*  After a disaster the we have had disasters in Florida in in Texas there have been we just went through [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=379.41999999999996s)]
*  these terrible floods in North Carolina [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=386.53999999999996s)]
*  Right like Republicans understand the emergent the need for aid in an emergency and are completely for us on either side of crises that affect [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=389.02s)]
*  Democratic states and I will say so far the only Republican I've seen that has opposed attaching any kind of conditions is [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=396.71999999999997s)]
*  Tom Tillis senator Republican senator from North Carolina [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=403.21999999999997s)]
*  He said just just before we started recording put yourself. He's like put it yourself in their shoes. We were just [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=406.06s)]
*  Dealing with a hurricane here. We wanted relief like so would they which is a completely normal thing to think [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=411.86s)]
*  And say person the other thing is it's not just like you're punishing all the libs in, California [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=418.78000000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump got six million votes in the state of California. It's a lot of votes [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=422.94s)]
*  That's probably more votes than he got in a lot of different states that he won [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=428.3s)]
*  Yeah, it's also like [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=432.62s)]
*  The ideology the ideological part of it is just beside the point obviously but like [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=434.66s)]
*  Disasters a big disaster in California. It affects the whole country. This is a huge port [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=440.14s)]
*  This is a huge part of the American economy disaster in North Carolina affects the whole country [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=444.34000000000003s)]
*  The hope the whole idea is we help parts of the country rebuild because it helps all of us [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=448.08s)]
*  We are all better off when we know that in a disaster if there's something that happens to our [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=452.16s)]
*  Town our community our state that the resources will come in that that that come over the top of what you could do locally [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=456.66s)]
*  Because that protects all of us and presumably he'd like the Republican Party to do better in California going forward [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=462.5s)]
*  So maybe don't punish it now, right? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=467.56s)]
*  also like [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=470.02s)]
*  Say Gavin Newsom personally went to every reservoir and drained it so he could drink all the water himself [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=471.5s)]
*  So we could keep it by his house so he could as we could have extra water [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=477.86s)]
*  Why why does everyone else get punished for that? It is fucking insane. It is an insane thing to do [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=481.56s)]
*  One condition the Republicans are discussing is tying wildfire aid to the debt ceiling on Monday morning [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=486.86s)]
*  Politico reported that over dinner at Mar-a-Lago a group of House Republicans and President-elect Trump explored tying disaster relief with [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=491.62s)]
*  Extending the debt limit as a way to overcome internal Republican divisions that would likely sink any bill containing a debt ceiling increase [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=498.54s)]
*  they don't of course don't think that they can get the debt ceiling increase with just Republican votes because you get the Chip Roys of [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=505.82s)]
*  The world who like want trillions of dollars of cuts before they ever vote for a debt ceiling increase [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=511.06s)]
*  Apparently house speaker Mike Johnson was not in attendance at the dinner. So no final decision has been made [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=516.06s)]
*  But wouldn't be surprised if they move forward on this. What do you guys think of the idea? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=521.1999999999999s)]
*  Do you think Democrats House Democrats would support it? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=525.0799999999999s)]
*  I was relieved that we could help Donald Trump solve a political problem for himself [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=527.12s)]
*  You know as I watch the flames creep closer to my home and my business and where all my friends live [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=532.4s)]
*  I thought to myself. I really hope there's any silver lining here [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=537.36s)]
*  It can be that we solve this Freedom Caucus political problem for Donald Trump. So when it's so it's called the silver lining [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=540.38s)]
*  So the I think that's pretty calling about this too is so the reason Johnson's not wasn't there is that this was a specific meeting [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=547.08s)]
*  This was a meeting with [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=553.76s)]
*  Republicans from New York, New Jersey, California [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=555.4s)]
*  Who are specifically interested in raising the cap on state and local tax deductions? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=557.4s)]
*  The reasons that that's interesting is that was one of the ways they helped get the cost down on the original Trump tax [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=562.12s)]
*  that there's a state and local deduction that helps people from high tax states like California, New York and [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=568.32s)]
*  New Jersey and Trump is in this meeting with these guys and he and they're like this cap affected our people and Trump was [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=572.6s)]
*  Like I didn't know that nobody told me that so this is a meeting of a group of House Republicans [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=577.76s)]
*  Trying to figure out a way to make the debt problem worse [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=582.48s)]
*  That's the goal of this meeting and in order to make the debt problem worse [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=584.92s)]
*  Which is what this group of people wants to do [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=588.52s)]
*  They need either democratic votes or they need the votes of people that have not been opposed some of the time a [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=590.4s)]
*  Group of people that have never in their time in Congress voted to raise the debt limit [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=597.36s)]
*  some of them ran for Congress just to [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=602.48s)]
*  Oppose debt ceiling increases and so fundamentally what that meeting in is and what a lot of this is is an admission that [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=605.76s)]
*  Republicans are fucking stuck that they have to raise the debt limit [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=612.12s)]
*  They don't have the votes to do it and they're trying to figure out some way out of it [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=615.52s)]
*  Mike Johnson also talked about the possibility of the condition for California tying it to raising the debt limit [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=618.5600000000001s)]
*  Which is just a way of saying they don't think they can do it as Tommy was saying without Democratic votes [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=624.04s)]
*  Yeah, I reached out to a couple members of Congress to see if this was gaining currency and they were like [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=627.0s)]
*  I'm not sure about the debt ceiling piece of this [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=630.66s)]
*  But they do think that conditioning aid is is gaining a lot of momentum even though no one seems to know what the conditions are [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=632.76s)]
*  I mean, we're like half joking but like you if you look at Twitter [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=639.14s)]
*  It's like half of the attacks are Donald Trump jr. Saying that like DEI initiatives are the reason there were 100 mile per hour wins [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=642.2s)]
*  And then there's the Trump stuff which is like forest management and the smelt fish [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=647.96s)]
*  Which I know you and Dan talked about Thursday and I refuse to learn more about because it's so stupid [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=651.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's all you need to listen to even Gavin Newsom said all you have to do is listen to Pod Save America to find out about the smell fish [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=655.98s)]
*  The yeah, like it's like the aid is conditioned on opening up a pipe between Fresno and Laguna that doesn't exist [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=661.0200000000001s)]
*  It's like so but you know, there's a hope there which is like now so now Trump is expected to come out here next week [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=666.74s)]
*  And he's gonna talk to Newsom like you could see a situation [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=673.1s)]
*  In this we're in the stupidest timeline. We have been for a long time [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=677.7800000000001s)]
*  Where all of this is bluster Republicans go on shows they have to sound tough [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=682.26s)]
*  that's what they do Trump goes I talked to Newsom and [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=686.64s)]
*  he's like I knew some was okay and we came to an agreement and [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=689.62s)]
*  They're gonna and they the condition is like they're gonna they're gonna study forest management or they're gonna make a product some bullshitty thing [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=693.14s)]
*  To like Gavin should make a giant faucet and do like a grand opening like key to the city [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=699.66s)]
*  I like that I've been cutting type thing. But this sink in [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=704.14s)]
*  He fixed the yeah, yeah, so that's the best case scenario and by no means [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=707.3000000000001s)]
*  Clear that that will happen. Right? Well, it's hard to even like this is an emergency [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=713.5s)]
*  The the the the disaster relief needs to come quickly and so it's like wasn't a condition on some kind on California doing some reforms [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=716.54s)]
*  That seems impossible. How is that even gonna be enforced? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=723.22s)]
*  So it seems more about like some kind of restriction on the money that I really can declare victory on that would be the hope [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=725.38s)]
*  Yeah, they just want to say that they punished the libs in California. That's what they're gonna look they now control everything [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=729.78s)]
*  They control Washington Republicans. So they need enemies. They need villains [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=735.22s)]
*  That's the way that's the way that's their reason for being and so California is gonna be a big punching bag [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=739.1800000000001s)]
*  Probably New York's gonna be a big punching bag too, right? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=744.1800000000001s)]
*  They just got to find the libs wherever they can and that's gonna be Greenland, Panama [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=746.1600000000001s)]
*  California California. Yeah, that's that's about right. Yeah [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=751.02s)]
*  Alright, let's let's talk about Los Angeles yesterday [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=754.7s)]
*  The New York Times resurfaced a 2021 interview with Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass where she promised to quote not travel internationally [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=757.1800000000001s)]
*  Very specific pledge that bass broke last week when she was in Ghana as the Eaton and Palisades fires broke out in Los Angeles [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=765.0200000000001s)]
*  This comes after Los Angeles fire chief Kristen Crowley told Fox 11 [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=771.0600000000001s)]
*  Los Angeles on Friday that under basses leadership the city had failed her and her department by not providing enough funding to her department [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=774.9000000000001s)]
*  Curious what you guys think of the local response so far. Do you think the anger is warranted towards LA officials and mayor bass? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=783.46s)]
*  I [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=790.74s)]
*  Think 90% of being mayor is showing up and when you're out of town when something like this happens you are going to get [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=791.82s)]
*  People very angry and I think that's pretty justifiable anger [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=798.0200000000001s)]
*  Especially when this was not totally predicted these fires not the scope and scale [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=800.9000000000001s)]
*  but the the conditions that led to them were were known in advance and some of the reporting on on [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=806.22s)]
*  Mayor basses absence notes that mayor Han who was the mayor of Los Angeles on September 11, 2001 was in DC [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=812.46s)]
*  When the 9-eleven attacks happened he got stranded there for three days and voters punished him for he lost reelection [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=818.6600000000001s)]
*  I read that I had I had no idea about that story [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=824.46s)]
*  I didn't look at the time [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=826.46s)]
*  But he took the he got the first flight that left the East Coast back to the West Coast after 9-eleven [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=827.46s)]
*  He was on that first flight. He was gone for a couple days [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=833.82s)]
*  He says 60 hours 60 hours and it was still like one of the reasons he it was used against him for like the rest [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=836.74s)]
*  Of his career. Do you know who became it was the acting mayor in his happens? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=842.6800000000001s)]
*  Alex Padilla, huh? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=845.94s)]
*  Yeah, so [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=848.62s)]
*  Whether or not the mayor should have gone on the trip [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=851.2600000000001s)]
*  I think it's pretty clear that she should have come back once the warning started coming in Sunday [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=853.7800000000001s)]
*  They were pretty yes [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=859.3800000000001s)]
*  She left Saturday the warrant the extreme warnings were Sunday and that there were warnings before that on Friday [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=860.36s)]
*  There was some pretty dire ones on Saturday, too. Yeah, I do not think she should have been away during this [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=864.82s)]
*  during this time what I think is like [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=869.34s)]
*  What I I was like trying to it's so hard to understand what's going on now [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=872.46s)]
*  You you there's so much noise and you sort of step back from it and there's this debate about Karen Bass [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=876.3s)]
*  There's this I think very reasonable and important debate to have about [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=881.78s)]
*  How we manage fires in California water management in California [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=885.34s)]
*  Building policies in California all valid all important. I think there's an important debate to be had after this crisis [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=890.3s)]
*  There's an important debate to be had about the way in which accountability [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=896.38s)]
*  Is broken up and divided between Los Angeles as a city and Los Angeles as a county that I find quite stupid [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=899.66s)]
*  And anti-democratic and makes it very hard to figure out who is responsible and allows a lot of people [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=906.46s)]
*  To pass the buck, but I also think like the the kind of right-wing propaganda [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=911.18s)]
*  Blaming everything on woke plus some of these debates that are ultimately I think [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=917.24s)]
*  incidental to what what unfolded [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=921.96s)]
*  also like [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=924.3s)]
*  Obscure that like this has been an extraordinary response like there has been an [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=926.78s)]
*  Amazing success of local government in the in the face of unprecedented wildfires to get resources there like these these [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=932.1800000000001s)]
*  People on the on the lines for days without and getting in in face of like climate worsening [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=939.6600000000001s)]
*  Fires they're not responsible for people building houses on the hills. They're not responsible for 30 years of forest mismanagement [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=947.4200000000001s)]
*  They're not responsible for long-term water policies. They were they're trying to figure out how to put this out and like the the the [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=952.82s)]
*  Utility companies getting power back in a bunch of different places all at once like there's a lot of good in the response [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=960.34s)]
*  Too that I feel like has been completely obscured like I saw on social media people like sharing videos of of you know, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=967.3s)]
*  Helicopter or plane dropping water and like missing a building and being like here it is [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=975.1s)]
*  They're perfect example of California and why government liberal government has failed right here [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=979.5s)]
*  We have it once again like they these liberals can't do it. You need private firefighters [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=984.46s)]
*  You need a Rick Crusoe, whatever it is [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=988.42s)]
*  And it's like these are people doing their best and like from the from from where we were a few days ago to where we are [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=989.66s)]
*  Today like they did an extraordinary job [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=995.18s)]
*  I think the firefighters are some of the most courageous people in all of [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=997.38s)]
*  Public life and the fact that they they do this day in and day out and like you said love it [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1001.02s)]
*  I mean these guys were men and women were working 30 hour 40 hour shifts straight [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1005.8199999999999s)]
*  Battling fires in this extreme heat in some cases didn't have water now [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1009.9799999999999s)]
*  I do think so they slept in in a week days [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1013.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we're with news at the command center like talking to some of the firefighters there and they're like this is [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1016.7s)]
*  One guy's like I've been doing this for 40 50 years is the worst week of my life [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1022.58s)]
*  Yeah [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1025.78s)]
*  And that's why when you've like Don jr tweeting that like DEI initiatives and the firing of a couple [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1026.14s)]
*  White male fire chiefs is the reason like that's so insulting to all these firefighters out there doing their job now [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1031.1s)]
*  I do think there is a debate that should be happening about [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1036.58s)]
*  the speed of the response [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1040.38s)]
*  Why some of these fire hydrants ran out of water and I think the news from is trying to get to the bottom of that [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1042.98s)]
*  But other people need to do there's also an argument about the fire department's budget [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1047.74s)]
*  Whether it should have been 800 million 900 million like I have no idea [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1052.8999999999999s)]
*  But it's a huge problem for Karen Bass that the fire chief is saying they needed more money and they were refused [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1056.4599999999998s)]
*  again, I'm also sympathetic to the idea that no fire department in the world could deal with [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1062.58s)]
*  Four massive forest fires at the same time, especially in a hundred mile per hour winds [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1066.74s)]
*  but clearly there were some decisions made that [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1072.34s)]
*  hindered the response and I think we need to get to the bottom of them and also think [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1075.26s)]
*  There's been a void in terms of just local communication [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1079.3s)]
*  Like I don't know about you guys but like the 700 person press conferences just don't really do it for me when I'm looking for [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1082.6599999999999s)]
*  Clear leadership neither did the several [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1088.1399999999999s)]
*  false emergency alerts that went up on our phone in fact when we were [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1091.54s)]
*  recording an episode [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1095.8999999999999s)]
*  Something on Friday or Thursday a bunch went off and it was like terrifying people won one of it four in the morning [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1097.94s)]
*  Terrified for people who are like in Pasadena area right near the zone. So like it could have been them evacuating [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1103.94s)]
*  Yeah, I just done that too. Like yes false alarms. Very scary [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1110.6200000000001s)]
*  You do know false alarms people aren't gonna take the real one. Seriously. That's the huge of course [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1114.8600000000001s)]
*  Here's my thing. Like of course when a disaster strikes [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1119.26s)]
*  There's going to be plenty to criticize about there's gonna be plenty to praise plenty to criticize about the response and [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1124.04s)]
*  As you guys both pointed out there are plenty of debates to be had in Los Angeles and around Los Angeles and state of California [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1130.76s)]
*  About water fire all that stuff the challenge is like we can't have those debates [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1137.0s)]
*  publicly in an information environment where you're getting these bad faith attacks from the right and all this misinformation and so it's so [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1143.64s)]
*  Difficult to have like rational conversations and look this is we're gonna have more [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1150.96s)]
*  There's gonna be more disasters and they're gonna be more frequent now because there's climate change [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1155.32s)]
*  And if we are not able to when the disaster hits first focus on okay, how do we put out the fires? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1159.08s)]
*  How do we take care of everyone then figure out? Okay, what happened? What did everyone fuck up? Who's to blame right? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1165.44s)]
*  Like I don't want to make this seem like we are [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1171.2s)]
*  I'm certainly not interested in being partisan or not criticizing someone just because they're a Democrat [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1173.52s)]
*  I don't give a shit like if it turns out that like Karen Bass really fucked up or Gavin Newsom fucked up whoever it is [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1179.04s)]
*  We the first to criticize that person, you know [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1184.52s)]
*  but like you you do have to figure out the information and [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1186.56s)]
*  it's hard to do in the fog of war which is where we're at right now and I don't know you just gotta like [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1190.32s)]
*  Well, it's just so hard to do that in this environment [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1196.92s)]
*  Well, like I think Newsom said this to you some version of like the truth requires some patience and requires some time [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1199.24s)]
*  We're in the middle of it. We're in the middle of it and the fact look [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1205.22s)]
*  Pre-deployment problems surely we will learn ways to do this better. Some of it will be personalities individuals who made mistake [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1208.72s)]
*  Some of it will be structural which is much less interesting and people don't give a shit about which is probable [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1215.28s)]
*  Probably ultimately have been even more important [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1219.92s)]
*  But just the fact that these terrible fires raged is not in and of itself a sign that the government [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1222.56s)]
*  Failed just because it looks bad on TV. So much of this is about what looks bad on TV [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1229.44s)]
*  I don't want to defend Karen Bass [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1234.04s)]
*  I found it shocking that she went to France for the Olympics three times which I learned from that article three times [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1235.6399999999999s)]
*  That's a lot of times Olympics not enough croak madam. I mean I have been looking for this too. Like [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1241.72s)]
*  It's so far. I haven't seen anyone with experience in fighting fires or dealing with water issues make the case that [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1248.24s)]
*  Extra firefighters or one more water reservoir one was offline at the time being repaired [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1253.72s)]
*  Would have done anything to change the fact that it was [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1259.68s)]
*  mostly severe winds and the inability to get the helicopters in the air that were primarily responsible for the devastation the [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1262.08s)]
*  Palisades and in Alta Dina, right? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1269.48s)]
*  Like it I'm open to if someone can make that case like maybe that's wrong, but I haven't seen that and so [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1271.8s)]
*  That's that's the main thing right? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1277.8799999999999s)]
*  That's the main problem and then everything else are really is really important to figure out as we move on but in the interim [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1279.8799999999999s)]
*  You're seeing tweets with millions and millions of views saying because Karen Bass was out of town the acting mayor didn't declare an emergency [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1285.6s)]
*  Declaration which is why Biden didn't get the water dropping Navy helicopters into the air until Wednesday [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1294.04s)]
*  And you read that many people said that to me you sent me [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1300.08s)]
*  And someones and I got friends were like why weren't the helos there? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1303.36s)]
*  Why why did what why went the Navy dropping planes there and you read it and you think okay? [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1306.36s)]
*  This is a person who seems to have had a big job in local LA politics [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1310.48s)]
*  And then you think for five seconds to yourself and you're like Joe Biden doesn't have access to [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1314.2s)]
*  Special magic helicopters that can fly around with tons and tons of water and a hundred mile-power winds [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1318.8s)]
*  you know, this is clearly nonsense and the disaster declaration stuff like [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1323.42s)]
*  99% of that is about getting [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1328.2s)]
*  Resources or funding to an area hit by a disaster after the fact not before it's Elon Musk [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1330.44s)]
*  He is has been doing some good stuff and like setting up Starlink and helping around here with some of the [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1336.9599999999998s)]
*  Cleanup, but at the beginning the beginning of this is going on Alex Jones this whole video [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1342.7199999999998s)]
*  It's like 40 minute video where he said that the fires were part of a larger globalist plot to cause the collapse of the United [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1348.1999999999998s)]
*  States and Elon responds to him true [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1354.08s)]
*  It's um [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1357.52s)]
*  For the most part though it is the kind of the mirror image of the kind of conspiratorial mindset like that [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1359.04s)]
*  Whatever that's fucking nuts in but like no most people do not believe that the government is responding as a conspiracy to hurt, California [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1364.72s)]
*  right [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1371.6399999999999s)]
*  but I think like the the mirror image of people assuming that [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1372.12s)]
*  There is some kind of conspiracy that explains everything is in a crisis like this. It can't just be bad [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1376.08s)]
*  It has to be because people have failed us there has to be individuals who are responsible [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1380.8799999999999s)]
*  There's to be someone to blame right now because I can't handle the uncertainty of just knowing that people are doing their best and it's not [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1384.72s)]
*  Working it has to be something else. It has to be hard [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1391.04s)]
*  It has to be it has to be more about a human failure [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1393.64s)]
*  Which is a very human impulse and I think it's just magnified in an age where we just see way too much information [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1396.24s)]
*  And way too many people who pretend to be experts and just bad actors and people should know better, you know, you know [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1402.16s)]
*  I must knows better. He understands the impact of climate change used to live in California [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1406.64s)]
*  He understands the Santa Ana winds, you know, it's just for him to reply to Alex Jones and boost that guy [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1410.2s)]
*  It's it's indefensible. Yeah, Paz of America is brought to you by Haya [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1414.88s)]

*  setting the agenda [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1684.24s)]
*  Bringing others together behind our plans and visions Tommy would you make it the speech anything? [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1686.6s)]
*  Surprising or missing that was notable so I think I curious what you guys think I think even pretty highly engaged voters are gonna remember [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1692.48s)]
*  Like two to three things you did on foreign policy. I think for Obama [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1700.0800000000002s)]
*  It's gonna be bin Laden operation probably maybe the Syria red line the more charitable version is, you know [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1703.8400000000001s)]
*  Paris climate accords or the Iran deal, right like a few things [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1709.24s)]
*  Yeah, big things think of like bin Laden for most bin Laden's number one from medium info voters. Yeah bin Laden's number one [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1712.52s)]
*  I think so I believe I wish it was maybe a round deal different [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1718.8s)]
*  I wish it was winding down the one rock new start or a Cuba normalization or some of the other stuff we did [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1722.12s)]
*  because you know, but I think it's probably those bigger things and [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1726.72s)]
*  For Biden I think the list of things that he's gonna be remembered for on foreign policy are the Afghanistan withdrawal [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1730.2s)]
*  Gaza and then something about Ukraine and I think what's hard for Biden in this speech [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1738.08s)]
*  Is that while I think that ending the war in Afghanistan was objectively the right thing to do [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1743.4s)]
*  And a risky political decision it will be remembered as a failure [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1747.4799999999998s)]
*  But the the Gaza because of the withdrawal because of withdrawal, but the Gaza peace [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1752.3999999999999s)]
*  It's the worst is an unmitigated [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1757.84s)]
*  disaster and [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1760.12s)]
*  despite Biden sort of bigger picture claims in the speech that we've [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1761.6399999999999s)]
*  You know, he's restored our standing in the world and diplomacy [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1766.0s)]
*  I think Gaza has hurt our diplomatic standing and it's made us less safe like his own [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1770.1s)]
*  NCTC director the National Counterterrorism Center said anti-american sentiment driven by the war in Gaza is at a level not seen since the Iraq war and [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1775.74s)]
*  Groups like Al Qaeda and Isis are recruiting on that sentiment issuing the most specific calls for attacks on America in years [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1783.22s)]
*  So it's like this speech seemed like they kind of wanted to pull out [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1789.5800000000002s)]
*  Gaza and make it an afterthought when I really think it's gonna be the center of his foreign policy legacy [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1794.3400000000001s)]
*  Especially when you know, there's reporting last week the Lancet very prestigious medical journal [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1800.8s)]
*  They did a study of the death toll in Gaza in the first nine months and they found it to be 40% higher than the official [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1804.9s)]
*  Count from the Hamas health ministry [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1810.94s)]
*  so I think like the story about this war is gonna get worse and worse over time and [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1812.8200000000002s)]
*  There's just the the tone and tenor of how they talk about it has not changed [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1817.0600000000002s)]
*  I think obviously you do these speeches because you want to change that narrative [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1821.42s)]
*  you want to talk about the investments in technology and [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1824.6200000000001s)]
*  Alliances and climate change and rallying the world on Ukraine and I think he deserves a lot of credit on Ukraine [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1827.98s)]
*  But even that section felt a little bit divorced from the current reality, which is that Russia has gained momentum on the battlefield and [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1833.18s)]
*  The Ukrainians have a very uncertain future with Donald Trump coming in. So I get why you do this speech [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1840.26s)]
*  But I think you know, it didn't [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1847.02s)]
*  I'm not sure that it's gonna be effective. It was um, they're striking that you could imagine [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1849.5s)]
*  Joe Biden giving a very very similar version of the speech had Kamal Harris [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1855.42s)]
*  One like he says overall we have reinvigorated people's faith in the United States as a true true partner [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1860.26s)]
*  Is that true? Have you done that? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1866.1s)]
*  Do you think that's where people are right now as they want you hand the keys over to Donald Trump? [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1867.22s)]
*  Even if there is some truth to the fact that you have [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1871.82s)]
*  Reestablished relationships and had the achievements that you're describing [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1874.5s)]
*  You live in a world where your presidency will be bookended by Donald Trump and all the damage and policy changes that that brings and you [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1877.82s)]
*  Can try to pretend otherwise and you can subtly or or not [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1884.78s)]
*  So subtly kind of hint at trying to create kind of like political leverage on Trump about the the position [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1887.66s)]
*  He'll enter the office in the changes that Joe Biden has made but the speech largely seems to ignore the fact that we're about [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1893.3s)]
*  to transition to someone who [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1899.1399999999999s)]
*  Is gonna do great damage to our policies internationally in our reputation [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1901.78s)]
*  I think that Joe Biden and his administration are not the first to want to hammer home their accomplishments [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1905.34s)]
*  Every administration wants to do that. I think [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1911.78s)]
*  What they have done is a lesson for future administrations, hopefully future Democratic administrations that that [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1914.18s)]
*  ignoring reality and [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1921.3999999999999s)]
*  And just sort of like not wrestling with the challenges that are still there at the end of your presidency [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1924.06s)]
*  Your mistakes your failings your shortcomings some maybe which even if you don't believe you were at fault for them [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1930.7s)]
*  Acknowledging them wrestling with them in a speech talking to people about them is still the best way [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1938.02s)]
*  To either change people's minds or at least let people know like where you are on the issue [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1943.86s)]
*  To me it felt like there's there's no theme. There's no story to this speech [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1948.5s)]
*  There's no it was like a Senate floor speech to his Senate Foreign Relations Committee [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1952.26s)]
*  You know colleagues and it just it struck me to what you said love it. It's like since the election [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1957.22s)]
*  We're all in a bit of denial the Donald Trump one, right? We're all sort of it's very different than in 2016 [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1963.98s)]
*  We've talked about all the reasons, but we're all in a bit of denial [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1969.08s)]
*  We're all sort of we haven't quite grappled with it yet [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1971.54s)]
*  But he's the president United States and he hasn't grappled with it really, you know [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1974.14s)]
*  Like he he did that he did the oval speech a couple days after the election, right and I appreciated that [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1977.66s)]
*  But it's it's just it's a weird and I don't think Kamala Harris really has either like no Democrat really has it just very [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1983.3400000000001s)]
*  it's a weird feeling to the president United States give a [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1989.82s)]
*  Maybe maybe the speech Wednesday night the Oval Office address will wrestle with some of them and sort of the future of democracy [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1993.3400000000001s)]
*  But I was I was trying to feel like what what what would a speech have been that [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=1999.16s)]
*  Really would have sort of addressed some of these these larger issues [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2005.72s)]
*  and I think it would have been him like [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2009.3600000000001s)]
*  talking about Gaza and what happened and making his case on Gaza and and talking about [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2010.92s)]
*  The fact that as proud as he is of what we did with Ukraine [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2015.3600000000001s)]
*  This the future there is very uncertain and talking about how he's so proud of making the decision on Afghanistan [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2018.72s)]
*  But yeah the withdrawal and the way it went he's always gonna think about that [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2024.9s)]
*  He's always gonna remember that you know [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2027.78s)]
*  Like there's just there was no nuance or subtlety or even just like a little daylight and like yeah, we had some problems [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2028.8999999999999s)]
*  There's there's a refusal to give critics an inch and entertain. Yes their criticism as valid [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2035.02s)]
*  Yeah, and just on Gaza like it came up first obliquely in [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2040.84s)]
*  In the context of him talking about how the administration rallied a coalition to prevent [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2046.3s)]
*  Attacks by the Houthis in the Red Sea and it's like mr. President [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2051.32s)]
*  Why are the Houthis attacking ships in the Red Sea it's because of the war in Gaza [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2054.62s)]
*  And then when you finally get to the Gaza section 20 minutes into the speech [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2057.94s)]
*  He says Palestinians suffer terribly in this war. They've been through hell [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2061.42s)]
*  So many innocent people have been killed and there's just no effort to sort of contend with the fact that they were killed [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2064.38s)]
*  Mostly by American weapons that we gave the Netanyahu administration [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2070.66s)]
*  And while you could defend a military intelligence response to the war in the very very early months [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2074.6s)]
*  15 months later, we're still you know, just hoping for a ceasefire that has been [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2081.04s)]
*  Eluded his grasp over and over and over again. Yeah, I think there's a divorce from kind of the the horrors of what people see [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2086.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's also you know [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2093.5s)]
*  Okay, you're describing your accomplishments, but [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2095.58s)]
*  We're seeing Donald Trump take office here. We're seeing right-wing movements rising around the world [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2099.7599999999998s)]
*  What have you learned about that? Like I don't need you to take on your critics [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2104.7599999999998s)]
*  I understand not wanting to engage with them. But like what have you learned about being president? [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2107.3799999999997s)]
*  What have you learned about America? [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2111.4399999999996s)]
*  You could have done and even if you wanted to not get into the Gaza of it all you could have done a speech about [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2112.66s)]
*  Sort of the rising authoritarian movements around the world what you learned over the last few years [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2118.02s)]
*  Bring in Trump talk about like you could have done a whole there could have been a number of interesting speeches that weren't just like [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2122.7799999999997s)]
*  Here's all the amazing things we did. You're all wrong. We did some we did the best we could we did great stuff [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2128.2s)]
*  And that's it [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2133.2799999999997s)]
*  Maybe you know, you don't go to you don't go to the hardware store for milk and like I guess I'm not gonna get anything [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2134.0s)]
*  From Joe Biden Beyond America's the best days are ahead and maybe that's all we can really expect from him at this point [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2138.26s)]
*  but [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2143.38s)]
*  It's like this is a dark moment for this country [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2144.54s)]
*  The it will be a dark few years for this country pretending otherwise just makes you irrelevant [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2146.96s)]
*  Yeah [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2151.3s)]
*  And just look any sort of conversation about legacy or accomplishments is impossible to really have right now [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2151.52s)]
*  The end of the story is unwritten Donald Trump might unwind some things [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2158.22s)]
*  He might not I mean a lot of this happened to Obama the Iran deal went away the Cuba opening went away [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2161.48s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of things that we were really proud of that Donald Trump fucked up and that could happen again [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2165.26s)]
*  And so I understand [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2169.2400000000002s)]
*  Taking a swing but I agree with you. I just I don't think it's convincing to talk about sort of AUKUS and you know [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2172.16s)]
*  alliances [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2178.8s)]
*  Yeah, in the face of you know handing the keys over to Donald Trump [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2180.8s)]
*  it's a lot to talk about alliances, but alliances are a means to an end and [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2184.2400000000002s)]
*  It's not just like we have alliances and alliances are great for for that reason right and so like what are the larger goals? [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2188.22s)]
*  And I was thinking about as he prepares to deliver this final farewell address [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2193.46s)]
*  Like how he could do that in a way that I would find [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2199.02s)]
*  Inspiring or at least comforting, you know, I do think like he could frame it as like here are the fights that I took on [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2203.58s)]
*  Here's where we made some progress. Here's where we weren't able to right and then here's a path forward for everyone [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2210.06s)]
*  Here's why I'm still hopeful and some humility some recognition of where we are now, you know, like you could imagine and look it is a [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2216.14s)]
*  Like you said, he's just he's in a tough tough situation right now because Donald Trump won and it was a fucking mess [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2222.8399999999997s)]
*  And so I get that. Yeah, I'm being very harsh. I also think that's like this is not a moment where we like no speech can resolve our [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2228.56s)]
*  Frustrations hoe anger fear for what's about to come and that's an impossible position [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2236.48s)]
*  There's also just there's there's some things that we all know are kind of stump speech lines [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2240.2s)]
*  And the conclusion about how he's never been more optimistic about the future for the United States [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2243.18s)]
*  And the kind of whispering and the yelling about how there's nothing beyond our capacity as a country like I he must believe that in [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2248.3399999999997s)]
*  His bones, which is why he says it all the time [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2253.62s)]
*  But boy, it could not have felt more hollow in this moment given what we're about to go through [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2255.54s)]
*  I'm a pretty hopeful optimistic person. I can tell you I've definitely felt more optimistic [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2260.66s)]
*  43 years on this earth. I could tell it most most of the years. I felt more optimistic than this one [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2267.54s)]
*  It's just like like yeah, it's just sort of like we're going backwards man [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2272.2000000000003s)]
*  That's you're gonna have to we have to we're gonna face it whether you can or not [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2275.44s)]
*  And part of the reason this is not just to beat up on Joe Biden [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2278.44s)]
*  We do that a lot now [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2281.2000000000003s)]
*  But like this is for other Democrats by the way who are gonna run for president again next time right like [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2282.32s)]
*  You we cannot just do the happy talk here and that's not to like we don't want to bring everyone down [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2287.8s)]
*  But in order to inspire people and to get everyone to be hopeful again, you have to acknowledge the reality [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2292.28s)]
*  You have to grapple with what we're dealing with right now [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2298.2000000000003s)]
*  Make the nerdiest analogy I've ever made in this show [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2300.02s)]
*  So in in Star Trek the next generation [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2305.06s)]
*  Good start every once in a while and is it everyone's a while [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2308.46s)]
*  there's an episode where they go to the Battle Bridge and [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2312.22s)]
*  Basically the bridge is where they have their kind of high-flute and conversations as a Congress [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2314.5s)]
*  There's a conference room off the off the bridge where you sit and you talk about the nature of [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2317.9s)]
*  Life and and what it means to be a spacefaring people that everyone's while the ship gets so fucked up and so many people [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2321.78s)]
*  Are dead and something is so broken that they got to go to the Battle Bridge. I [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2328.42s)]
*  Just think we need a battle bridge. Okay mindset. That's all yeah. Yeah, we're in the this is a we're about to we're in the battle bridge [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2332.4s)]
*  We've been defeated every which way a bridge direction people have blown [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2337.92s)]
*  Yeah, exactly a bridge direction the people have been blown from one side of the bridge the other side of the bridge the shit [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2341.7200000000003s)]
*  Is it the fan the saucer is separated? [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2347.0s)]
*  That's the energy before we jump to the interview some quick news about our new MAGA oligarchs [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2349.4s)]
*  Last week Mark Zuckerberg followed up his announcement that the company would abandon fact-checking content moderation and DEI initiatives [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2354.02s)]
*  By sitting down with who else Joe Rogan [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2360.86s)]
*  It was a wide-ranging two-hour interview that included plenty of Trump ass-kissing and complaints that content moderation is just too difficult [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2363.52s)]
*  Let's listen. I think you start one of these if you care about about giving people a voice [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2370.5s)]
*  You know I wasn't too deep on our content policies for like the first ten years of the company [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2374.98s)]
*  It was just kind of well known across the company that [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2379.98s)]
*  We were trying to give people the ability to share as much as possible. I kind of think in [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2383.48s)]
*  2016 in the aftermath I [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2388.64s)]
*  gave too much deference to [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2391.36s)]
*  a lot of folks in the media who were basically saying [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2394.12s)]
*  Okay, there's no way that this guy could have gotten elected except for misinformation [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2397.64s)]
*  I think people just felt like the fact-checkers were too biased. I don't know. It's something out of like, you know, 1984 one of these [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2400.7999999999997s)]
*  Books where it's one of those books really is a slippery slope and it just got to a point where it's just okay [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2408.5400000000004s)]
*  This is destroying so much trust, especially in the United States to have this program [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2414.2200000000003s)]
*  If the US tech industry is going to continue being really strong [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2418.9s)]
*  I [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2424.0200000000004s)]
*  Do think that the US government has a role in [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2425.1400000000003s)]
*  In basically defending it abroad and that's one of the things that I'm optimistic about will will happen in this administration [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2428.42s)]
*  Tommy you listen to the interview over the weekend first why and second what's true to you? Yeah long drive [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2434.44s)]
*  my takeaways were [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2441.2s)]
*  This was it was an interview for an audience of two Joe Rogan and Donald Trump [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2442.88s)]
*  I think in that sense it was a very effective one for in terms of his spin [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2447.24s)]
*  But it was just so fundamentally dishonest [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2451.04s)]
*  I mean Zuckerberg acts like he is a brand new CEO who just took charge at Facebook and is mopping up all the [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2453.02s)]
*  Slop created by his predecessor not the guy who founded the company, right? [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2460.42s)]
*  He's like a newborn baby viewing everything with fresh eyes and his new stylist [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2464.74s)]
*  And it's just but this idea that he was not involved in content moderation decisions for the first decade. I'm sorry [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2468.5s)]
*  What were you doing then? That is such bullshit or the idea that Facebook was founded on free speech [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2474.5s)]
*  No, you were ranking hot girls in your dorm [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2478.84s)]
*  And then you wanted to get rich like well, we can't stop with these fairy tales [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2480.5s)]
*  But mostly he's mad about government regulation and he points at two inflection points is really [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2483.62s)]
*  Being kind of like learning moments one is the 2016 election and Facebook's role in [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2488.2s)]
*  The way they got criticized for Russian disinformation on the platform and then co vid and and on the 2016 election [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2493.2s)]
*  It was instructive as he talks about he says upon reflection [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2499.46s)]
*  I gave too much deference to people in the media who said there was misinformation [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2502.7s)]
*  Because you know and I wish I hadn't done that the point being that he believed the media when they said that only through [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2506.36s)]
*  Misinformation could Trump have been [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2512.92s)]
*  Elected but those of us who were paying attention at the time remember [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2514.7599999999998s)]
*  That's not how it all went down like that [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2517.8399999999997s)]
*  His his response two days after the election was to call it crazy [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2520.3999999999996s)]
*  To suggest that Russia could have influenced the election fast forward to October of 2017 [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2524.7599999999998s)]
*  Facebook then says that the Russian posts could have reached up to 126 million Americans and just to be clear [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2530.4399999999996s)]
*  I don't think Russia is why Hillary lost but the strongest data point that they were a factor came from Facebook [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2536.4399999999996s)]
*  So his whole narrative there is total bullshit. He's obviously very mad about whatever the Biden team did during co bid [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2543.44s)]
*  He's very mad about Biden saying that that people were getting killed because of information on Facebook that was leading to vaccine hesitancy [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2550.26s)]
*  Or whatever, but the whole thing is the naked attempt to position the company for the Trump era and like more broadly [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2557.86s)]
*  He says zero self-awareness like he criticizes [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2563.7400000000002s)]
*  Apple for not innovating since the iPhone [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2566.54s)]
*  This is a company that just steals features from snapchat and then I was gonna say [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2568.68s)]
*  Instagram if you want to if you want to count the the goggles or whatever [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2573.7599999999998s)]
*  And then at one point he's complaining about like trust in the media and influential people and he says quote the whole cultural elite class needs [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2580.7999999999997s)]
*  To get repopulated with people we actually trust we agree mark. That's why we want you to go away [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2587.56s)]
*  So it's a very frustrating listen, but he wins over Rogan like that [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2593.7799999999997s)]
*  He also had some interesting things to say about masculinity a subject on which he is of course the foremost authority [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2597.66s)]
*  Let's listen just I think a lot of a corporate world is is like pretty [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2603.1s)]
*  Culturally neutered there's something the the the kind of masculine energy [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2608.9s)]
*  I think is is good and I think having a culture that [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2613.7599999999998s)]
*  Like celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2617.2999999999997s)]
*  Just like having a thing that I can just like do with my guy friends and like yeah, and [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2623.12s)]
*  It's just like we're just like beat each other a bit. It's good [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2628.72s)]
*  Just wish we could beat each other more keep beating it your diary [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2633.56s)]
*  You'll never believe it [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2638.52s)]
*  We were just in the studio and it felt like a normal day [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2641.96s)]
*  Maybe it was maybe it was what was happening in our city [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2645.16s)]
*  Just [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2648.04s)]
*  We can beat each other um [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2650.46s)]
*  Whoa, what what is that so it's strange to me? [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2652.46s)]
*  It's like so obvious and transparent that it's just it's like sloppy [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2655.74s)]
*  So yeah, no first of all love love advice on masculinity from someone dressed by a stylish to look like East Brunswick's [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2660.3s)]
*  coolest bar mitzvah DJ [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2668.46s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I was trying to figure out what this even really means like the corporate culture has been [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2672.94s)]
*  And I think it means yelling at employees is actually I think it's a lot like less like wait cuz I there's a sort of [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2678.1s)]
*  I think like kind of corporate idea right that like feminine structures are more flat and [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2685.62s)]
*  Collaborative and male structures are more [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2692.42s)]
*  hierarchical and aggressive right and I think they meant like they they feel like there this is like all [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2695.2599999999998s)]
*  me to [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2701.66s)]
*  Post I don't this is like post me to post BLM [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2703.34s)]
*  But it's also very language backlash part of it mark and [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2706.64s)]
*  Peter teal sort of like techno authoritarianism like you must the strong must survive and we and we [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2710.2799999999997s)]

*  It's also like such a silly thing [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2724.0s)]
*  But like you know it really reminds you of 1984 in the slippery slope no slippery slope in 1984 [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2725.8399999999997s)]
*  You're right there in it in [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2731.24s)]
*  For in books and other books the clock strikes 13 like that yeah [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2733.2599999999998s)]
*  For but you're 1984 you're never there's no before you're in it. You're just in it. You'd you actually never get the slope [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2737.66s)]
*  You're at the bottom of it [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2742.66s)]
*  Who set the corporate culture at Facebook mark who who who decided Facebook? [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2744.4599999999996s)]
*  Who was in charge of new Facebook was going to do content moderation and monitor? [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2749.4599999999996s)]
*  COVID and COVID vaccine misinformation they said they were gonna do it and then when the government reached out the government was saying hey [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2753.8999999999996s)]
*  You have a policy on this so we wanted to point out things that are violating your policy they came up with the policy [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2761.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, there's a there's um [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2767.98s)]
*  There's something that there's a there's a freedom that comes from being like Trump or wanting to be in Trump's good graces and people [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2769.98s)]
*  Talk about the ways in which it's sort of all you like that you just have to kind of basically [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2775.2599999999998s)]
*  You know agree with Trump, and then you're in his his his favor [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2780.22s)]
*  But there's a subtle way in which I think what what what you also get to do is pretend that there are no [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2783.62s)]
*  Hard choices in life and Zuckerberg does that a bit in this interview where he acknowledges that there are difficult decisions and some [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2789.1800000000003s)]
*  Filters have more false positives and more false negatives, but what he's doing here when he talks about COVID we talked about misinformation in 2016 [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2794.82s)]
*  He's not acknowledging the trade-off. There was a ton of misinformation on Facebook whether it helped or hurt or mattered [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2800.94s)]
*  I don't know. There was a ton of dangerous misinformation on COVID right? [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2806.4s)]
*  Maybe some things got swept up in that net that now in hindsight they think maybe went too far and maybe was not correct [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2809.46s)]
*  But didn't need to be taken down whatever but there was dangerous misinformation [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2815.0s)]
*  That was a very real issue and and if you're gonna do less of that as you said in your own video [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2818.04s)]
*  That there will be worse and terrible things you now see on Facebook as a result [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2823.7599999999998s)]
*  There are trade-offs here you built this platform and and Tommy to your point about him not thinking about content moderation [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2827.64s)]
*  I [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2833.6s)]
*  Think it actually is like a kind of more damning thing to to say to believe him [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2834.94s)]
*  Because I do think whether it was Twitter Twitter did not start as a platform for people to share their political views [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2839.6s)]
*  It wasn't about what you thought it was about what was happening [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2844.48s)]
*  It was supposed to be about sharing where you are Facebook was about a post [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2847.26s)]
*  I mean obviously it was about ranking hot faces, but but like it was not about politics [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2851.5800000000004s)]
*  It was about posting about your life in your community [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2856.1200000000003s)]
*  They have all been continuously over and over again caught off guard by what happens when politics and celebrity [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2858.92s)]
*  Intercede until they're into their into their platforms and then they built something so big they couldn't control it if you build a building [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2864.44s)]
*  And you're like sorry, it's too big to make sure it's safe. Nobody gives you a credit for it [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2870.44s)]
*  But they built something too big to be made safe [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2875.02s)]
*  Also, he's getting rid of content moderation at the time that they also announced that they're bringing back politics on Facebook [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2877.02s)]
*  Right there turn there. They're turning the politics knob on again. They're getting rid of all their DI initiatives [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2881.74s)]
*  And so I mean what's so frustrating about this if you've been paying attention to Mark Zuckerberg in Facebook over the last 20 years like every [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2886.7s)]
*  Few years he does something like this. He apologizes for something and he and he has a new [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2891.62s)]
*  revelation and basically they turn like happy to glad and some corporate governance policies and [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2897.08s)]
*  Kind of like bend whichever way the political winds shift them [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2901.84s)]
*  But we also know that you know, there were most of the moderation was done in the United States [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2904.92s)]
*  There were other countries where there was no moderation like in Myanmar [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2909.8s)]
*  Yeah, where Facebook was used to foment a genocide and played a pretty key role in horrible ethnic violence. So [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2913.52s)]
*  The idea that there's some revelation that they should just do less [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2920.8s)]
*  I mean I I wasted a lot of time today in my prep and I read his [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2924.44s)]
*  6000 word letter to the community of Mark Zuckerberg's from [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2928.34s)]
*  2017 where they talked about how accuracy of information is very important our approach will focus less on banning this information more on surfacing additional [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2932.02s)]
*  perspectives and information including that fact-checkers dispute and items accuracy bubble [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2939.18s)]
*  It's like guess he wasn't really involved in that. Yeah, we're just relearning the same things over and over [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2943.3s)]
*  but that was interesting to because I remember he was criticized from the left because he wasn't taking posts down he was just gonna [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2947.06s)]
*  Demonetize them or lower them in the rankings. I can't remember. Yeah, they [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2953.06s)]
*  Algorithmically made it so they were less shared but they also got yelled at for taking down newsworthy videos related to Black Lives Matter [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2956.32s)]
*  They took down a famous photo of a little girl who had been hit with napalm in Vietnam [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2962.2400000000002s)]
*  Remember so they had they over corrected in some ways [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2967.5s)]
*  And so I have sympathy for just how hard this problem is, but I just have no sympathy for how [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2969.84s)]
*  Transparent this is an attempt at getting just a Trump's good graces to our previous conversation about by an acknowledging reality [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2977.1200000000003s)]
*  This is also happening right here, right? [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2984.22s)]
*  Like content moderation is difficult like you just said that we talked about this on offline all the time if he had come out [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2986.64s)]
*  And said hey, we've tried all this different all these different ways to moderate content. None of them. Please anyone. It's too hard [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2991.42s)]
*  We're gonna try this what would it like? [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=2998.86s)]
*  Acknowledge that you just couldn't do it that the problem is too hard [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3000.9s)]
*  Probably would have still gotten criticism from all sides to get that but like this is all just bullshit. This is just like [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3003.9s)]
*  Donald Trump don't throw me in jail, but also like maybe I've been red-pilled [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3010.22s)]
*  And you know Kevin Roos of the New York Times his piece on this [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3014.1s)]
*  Suggested that maybe like Zuckerberg's views have been like have changed [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3017.7s)]
*  Maybe he has been radicalized since 2020 which you know good for him [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3022.06s)]
*  There's some evidence where he's like an older rich guy he's [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3027.42s)]
*  You know getting a little less whatever there's some evidence of Kevin's piece from sources [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3031.58s)]
*  He talked to that maybe Mark Zuckerberg is becoming a Republican [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3036.26s)]
*  But there's also just a wave of [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3038.94s)]
*  Tech giants like the Daily had a great piece on mark entries in today in Silicon Valley [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3040.7400000000002s)]
*  Generally and how they shifted away from Democrats Republicans and in the gist of it is [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3046.0s)]
*  Like like you're saying before love it to be a part of the MAGA movement [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3051.1000000000004s)]
*  You have to jump through one hoop which is to say you support Donald Trump and everything he doesn't says the Democratic Party [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3055.1000000000004s)]
*  We set up an infinite number of hoops that you also have to jump through and if you screw one up [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3060.9s)]
*  We'll slap the shit out of you and all these guys got the shit slapped out of them [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3065.22s)]
*  Multiple times publicly for things they said things they did [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3069.56s)]
*  There's this piece in the Andreessen [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3073.24s)]
*  Story about when Zuckerberg and his wife announced that they're giving away 99% of their money to charity and they were criticized for doing it [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3076.16s)]
*  Through I think it was like a for-profit entity or something [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3083.6s)]
*  I don't even remember all the details, but they all feel like I remember thinking that was bullshit that criticism [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3085.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, right with it. You know they all feel like you know we want to be called geniuses [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3089.9599999999996s)]
*  We did the right thing we played by your rules [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3094.36s)]
*  We used your language and we did your training initiatives and you know, you still hate us and so okay now [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3096.56s)]
*  We're gonna try something new. There's a part in the interview where he said that [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3102.88s)]
*  You know the that he that they felt in some way kind of attacked by the Biden administration and he thought that like hey [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3107.6400000000003s)]
*  Like, you know, we're American you're supposed to be on our team [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3113.6s)]
*  We're in a world here and we're to be fighting other countries and other countries tech tech [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3116.6400000000003s)]
*  Platforms another another and that at least Donald Trump wants America to win right which it feel like a kind of [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3120.96s)]
*  Something it reminded me of what I've heard over the years from various like kind of high up tech people [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3127.12s)]
*  Which is that like yeah, our companies are making mistakes, but you don't want to regulate them [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3133.04s)]
*  You don't want to break them up because we're actually in a fight with China [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3136.52s)]
*  We're actually in a fight with these other countries and I think that that is sincerely [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3138.6s)]
*  Sincerely, yeah, he doesn't like content moderation policies from other countries [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3142.12s)]
*  Yeah, like in some cases there's obviously there's a competition with China, I don't like the Chinese Communist Party [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3146.82s)]
*  I do think they lean on that as a yeah as a cudgel like [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3152.54s)]
*  Marking Dreeson isn't as worried about you know [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3155.6200000000003s)]
*  The AI race with China as he is about making a lot of money off of Bitcoin, right? [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3159.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, and I think with Zuckerberg [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3162.82s)]
*  I do think there is a lesson in this story in this broader [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3164.9s)]
*  flight of tech people to [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3169.26s)]
*  The Republican Party that Democrats should learn and about maybe about how we talk to people we disagree with [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3171.62s)]
*  So I was talking to another tech person back in the day [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3176.94s)]
*  And I remember this person telling me that he had been protested during kovat. I said, why did they protest you? [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3179.82s)]
*  He's pretty big low profile tech guy [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3184.98s)]
*  He's like, oh well, you know billionaires shouldn't exist or something [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3186.82s)]
*  And I think that that moment where a bunch of people came to this person's house who founded a pretty prominent [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3189.2599999999998s)]
*  Tech company that I knew like kind of tangentially [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3195.06s)]
*  Radicalized him and this guy ended up giving [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3198.18s)]
*  Tens and tens of millions of dollars to the Republican Party [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3200.8999999999996s)]
*  and I think there's probably a pretty direct line between [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3203.94s)]
*  His perception of how he was treated by Democrats and where he ended up. Yeah again, there's a difference between [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3206.7s)]
*  What might be the morally right or feel like the right thing to do and what is the most effective thing to do for the larger? [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3213.4199999999996s)]
*  cost [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3219.66s)]
*  Alright before we jump to the interview some housekeeping crooked friends at vote save America action and crooked ideas have set up a disaster [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3221.06s)]
*  Relief fund to benefit those impacted by the horrific wildfires here in LA [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3228.7s)]
*  It's super easy for you to make one donation that's split among incredible charities doing really important work for our neighbors and our first responders [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3232.7s)]
*  If you donate to the fund it gets split between the Latino Community Foundation offers financial assistance housing assistance emergency translation [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3240.8599999999997s)]
*  For people in heavily Latino communities here in Los Angeles affected by the fires [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3249.18s)]
*  There's the Los Angeles regional food bank [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3253.98s)]
*  There's the Los Angeles Fire Department Foundation, there's the United Way of Greater Los Angeles [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3256.02s)]
*  There's the California Community Foundation wildfire relief fund. Those are the five organizations [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3260.54s)]
*  We have now usually in these relief funds. Sometimes we change out the organizations we were in or add right? [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3266.1s)]
*  We talked to the local partners on the ground [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3271.42s)]
*  Thanks to all of you. We have raised nearly [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3274.42s)]
*  $100,000 for these groups so far nearly $100,000. So we've done relief funds just like this before [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3278.7s)]
*  Most recently for hurricane Haleen relief. We also did it during the pandemic. We've done it many times for some reason a bunch of [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3285.1400000000003s)]
*  right-wing media people and Republican operatives spent the weekend accusing us and vote save America of running a scam and [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3293.1000000000004s)]
*  stealing money from fire victims in our own fucking city and [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3299.94s)]
*  Soliciting people's contact info so we can do political fundraising all of which has made me [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3303.7400000000002s)]
*  Angrier and more upset than anything in a really long time and that's saying a lot [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3309.6200000000003s)]
*  Their claim is that because the relief fund is run through act blue [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3312.94s)]
*  Which is also a democratic fundraising platform that act blue takes 4% of the donations for themselves [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3316.7000000000003s)]
*  And then uses your contact info to spam you for candidate fundraising [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3322.62s)]
*  This is complete bullshit and anyone who bothered to do even the most cursory googling would have found that out [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3326.26s)]
*  The relief fund is run through act blue charities, which is a tax deductible charitable organization [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3332.38s)]

*  Blame you when things go wrong and credit someone else when things go, right? [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3647.66s)]

*  Well, let me just start by saying thanks for having me and isn't it a little crazy that this race is coming down to two [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3655.98s)]
*  Middle-aged white guys from the Midwest three-letter first names Ken and Ben [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3661.9s)]

*  I've always said being a party chair is the political equivalency of being a fire hydrant, right? [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3673.7999999999997s)]
*  You get pissed on by everyone [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3678.04s)]

*  The right way you're saying no more than you're saying yes. So by the time it's over you have far fewer friends [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3684.2799999999997s)]
*  So I'm eyes wide open about this [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3689.3199999999997s)]
*  I've been the chair of the Minnesota DFL the last 14 years came in to this job [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3691.28s)]
*  Right after the disastrous midterm elections in 2010 where we suffered, you know throughout the country as you remember John one of the worst [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3695.92s)]
*  Jalakins we faced as a party in in years and that was true in Minnesota. We lost a 40-year Senate majority [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3703.8s)]
*  We lost the state house [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3710.5600000000004s)]
*  We lost the longest held congressional seat in Congress in the 8th district with Jim over star and many races up and down the ballot [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3711.6800000000003s)]
*  Happened to help run a campaign for governor that year where we were successful in getting Mark Dayton elected by just eight thousand seven hundred [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3719.08s)]
*  And fifty votes and so to your point [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3726.2000000000003s)]
*  I mean we had to at that point the morale was low the finger pointing was high the name-calling [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3728.6800000000003s)]
*  The blaming people the morale was so low and people were fleeing the party right all of our stakeholders donors [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3734.04s)]
*  progressive partners and allies [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3741.08s)]
*  candidates no one wanted to anything to do with the party and what it took is [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3743.04s)]
*  When I came in as party chair [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3747.28s)]
*  it took someone to be able to bring all those groups back to the table and [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3748.96s)]
*  Realize if we're going to build power again [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3752.28s)]
*  We had to figure out a plan to win and we did that and we got back in power within two years [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3754.32s)]
*  And we haven't lost sense and we're in a similar moment right now, right? [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3758.6s)]
*  Where there's low morale a lot of finger pointing a lot of people trying to place blame [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3762.6s)]
*  I'm by the way, not here to win the argument [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3767.92s)]
*  I want us to win elections again, and that's what we've done in Minnesota [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3771.36s)]
*  And so there's a lot of reasons why I'm running I'm very clear-eyed about what this job isn't [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3774.4s)]
*  It's not a pathway to glory for people thinking that this is a pathway to relevancy [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3779.2000000000003s)]
*  It really isn't that either the next DNC chair has to focus relentlessly [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3784.08s)]
*  I'm building the infrastructure throughout this country to put us on a path to win again. And so that's why I'm running [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3788.4s)]
*  So there's a story you can tell about [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3794.32s)]
*  2024 that [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3796.88s)]
*  Trump's win was narrow [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3798.92s)]
*  Kamala Harris came close in the battleground states Democrats in the Senate and House and down ballot did better than you might think given [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3800.92s)]
*  How most people say they feel about the economy and the direction of the country and then there's a story about how Democrats [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3806.6800000000003s)]
*  Lost ground with nearly every demographic group in nearly every state [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3812.6800000000003s)]
*  Especially Latino voters and voters who didn't go to college and because of that lost for the second time [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3816.2000000000003s)]
*  To a convicted felon who tried to steal the last election [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3821.64s)]
*  Which of those stories sounds more right to you? I think both are accurate, right? They're both accurate [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3824.8s)]
*  It was a close election, right and we think about the [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3829.84s)]
*  presidential race [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3832.92s)]
*  114,000 vote swing of three battleground states and we'd be talking about a Kamala Harris Harris presidency right now [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3834.4s)]
*  Same with the house races, right seven thousand votes between three battleground districts. We'd be talking about [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3840.2000000000003s)]
*  Speaker Jeffries, so it was a close election [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3846.0s)]
*  But there's no doubt that what you said the second part of that is actually absolutely accurate [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3848.28s)]
*  We lost ground with big parts of our coalition and there's a whole host of reasons for that [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3853.7200000000003s)]
*  Many of them we don't know at this point. Of course, we know we lost ground with Latino voters [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3858.02s)]
*  We lost ground with younger voters. We lost ground with working-class households with women [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3861.88s)]
*  We lost ground with every demographic group with just a couple and I'll get to that in a moment [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3866.02s)]
*  But the reality is is that we have to figure out the how and why we lost ground [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3870.3s)]
*  We have to look at ad spend we have to look at messaging [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3874.24s)]
*  We have to look at our organizing tactics, right before we're too prescriptive with the solutions [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3877.02s)]
*  We have to really dig into why those groups left us [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3882.42s)]
*  And I would say one of the big lessons from this last election was the spring of 2024 [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3885.7s)]
*  There was research that came out that showed for the first time in [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3892.3799999999997s)]
*  American history the perceptions of the two political parties have actually changed the majority of Americans now feel that the Republican Party best [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3895.66s)]
*  represents the interests of the working class in the poor and the Democratic Party is a party the wealthy and elites and [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3903.74s)]
*  The only two groups by the way just to prove the point that we actually overperformed with were wealthy households and [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3908.8999999999996s)]
*  College educated voters that is a damning indictment John and who we are. That's not who we are as a party [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3915.2599999999998s)]
*  We have always been the party that's fought for the working class in the poor [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3921.06s)]
*  we've always been the party that's fought for the oppressed and marginalized and [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3924.2599999999998s)]
*  You know, so we have a lot of work to do right and you know [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3927.62s)]
*  It's not gonna change overnight and the other thing we need to acknowledge and you know this you've been involved for a long time [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3931.02s)]
*  This wasn't a singular occurrence all those groups leaving us [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3936.22s)]
*  This has been happening underneath our nose for some time and we have to stem the tide and reverse [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3939.2999999999997s)]
*  Reverse the tide we need to get those groups to come back to us. Well, obviously, you know, we need to wait for [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3944.12s)]
*  More data to sort of dive into the national picture from your perspective as someone who's been on the ground in Minnesota [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3950.44s)]
*  For the last decade you've obviously these trends have happened in every state in the country [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3958.78s)]
*  Minnesota is no exception [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3963.52s)]
*  You guys are fair. I think a little better. You have probably higher percentage of college educated voters than some [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3965.64s)]
*  Midwestern states so you would imagine Minnesota does a little better [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3972.7200000000003s)]
*  But you've probably seen the attrition with voters without a college degree in your state [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3975.6800000000003s)]
*  What what do you think because what do you think has caused it just just from your perspective in Minnesota? Well, I'll use some personal [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3980.48s)]
*  Examples of that my brother who's a Union carpenter [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3988.1600000000003s)]
*  He voted for Obama and 8 and 12 and Trump in 16 20 and 24, right? [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3990.56s)]
*  My father-in-law is a beef cattle farmer in southern Minnesota same thing voted for [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=3994.98s)]
*  Voted for Obama and then voted for Trump [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4000.04s)]
*  So we know that there are people who are moving away from our party and I think part of the challenge [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4002.8799999999997s)]
*  You ask them why why what was with the change, you know? [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4007.16s)]
*  Each of them had different reasons right and I'm happy to get into them [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4010.44s)]
*  but I think the larger point you're making is is that we have continued to lose ground with with [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4013.72s)]
*  non-college educated voters and part of that is I believe we've allowed our party to [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4019.92s)]
*  Essentially devolve into smaller and smaller messages, right? [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4026.0s)]
*  to appeal to [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4029.72s)]
*  Different parts of our really big tent coalition and as a result we've lost the narrative, right? [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4030.92s)]
*  We've lost the thing that connects all of the disparate parts of our coalition and and what is that? [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4036.16s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you Paul well stone my my first boss in politics understood this he understood that what what can? [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4041.66s)]
*  connected a corn farmer in southern Minnesota with a [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4048.0s)]
*  Steel worker on the Iron Range and a new refugee in the Twin Cities was economics, right? [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4051.7999999999997s)]
*  Kitchen table issues bread and butter issues that at the end of the day people are are [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4056.44s)]
*  Worried about and let me just give you an example of this for me, you know when we talk about working people and and [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4061.8s)]
*  Labor as an example that we just talked about this the other night too many people feel like [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4068.6000000000004s)]
*  We only show up when we're asking them for their vote and then we never [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4073.96s)]
*  Deliver on the promises we make to actually make a difference in their lives. I think we last year we were defending [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4078.96s)]
*  The Biden economy, of course, and it was a great economy one of the best economies we've seen in years, right? [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4085.64s)]
*  From a GDP perspective a job growth perspective from unemployment and real wage growth [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4092.2799999999997s)]
*  But the reality is as we were trying to defend Joe Biden and and talk about all these things [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4097.639999999999s)]
*  We were ignoring the pain that average everyday working people in this country were facing right by working class, by the way [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4103.4s)]
*  It's not code for white people for me [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4111.24s)]
*  We know that the working class in this country is black brown and white people who are working their asses off [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4113.400000000001s)]
*  working harder than they ever have can barely afford their lives right and when [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4119.360000000001s)]
*  Gas prices are high and grocery prices are high and we're talking to them about the GDP [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4124.08s)]
*  We've already lost them because we're not acknowledging the economic pain that they're facing [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4128.84s)]
*  So for me part of this is getting back to the narrative that connects all parts of our Big Ten coalition, right? [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4133.4400000000005s)]
*  And that is a working class agenda that unites everyone whether you're whether you're a corn farmer or you're a new refugee in the Twin Cities [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4139.56s)]
*  I know you've talked a lot about how the Democratic Party has a brand problem. You're just explaining some of what it is [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4147.360000000001s)]
*  In how do you go about fixing a party's brand problem? [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4153.96s)]
*  You know, I've heard you say you reject the idea that Democrats need a wholesale change in our message [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4158.72s)]
*  it feels like the different levers you have to pull in in changing a party's brand are [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4163.8s)]
*  message [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4169.64s)]
*  candidates [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4170.76s)]
*  Sort of messaging infrastructure. What do you think? How do you how do you begin to fix a branding problem? [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4173.120000000001s)]
*  Well, well first you need to figure out what that brand is and I think that should be a working class [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4178.8s)]
*  Focusing on a working class agenda, right? [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4184.76s)]
*  so but but we need to spend a lot of time energy of thinking about [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4186.6s)]
*  Specifically what that looks like as it relates to the policy prescription [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4191.92s)]
*  But let me tell you I don't think it's an abandonment of our message or our policy agenda, right? [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4195.4s)]
*  Think about Missouri they passed a minimum wage increase fat paid family leave and abortion protections all by wide margins [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4201.24s)]
*  Yet those same voters went down the ballot and voted for Trump and the Republicans [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4207.8s)]
*  It seems to me that we see these issues. They're very popular throughout the country passing in ballot initiative and referenda [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4212.599999999999s)]
*  By wide margins, they're very popular, right? [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4220.8s)]
*  Yet those same voters aren't necessarily connecting the dots between the issues that they support [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4223.4s)]
*  That will actually make a difference in their lives and our Democratic candidates. So that's not a message problem. It's a messaging problem [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4229.08s)]
*  We're clearly not connecting the dots for voters. And so let me back up to one of the other lessons [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4236.18s)]
*  We've learned in this in this election [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4241.16s)]
*  Is that the Republicans have done a much better job than Democrats on competing in this new information environment? [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4243.96s)]
*  Right, and this is the other challenge we have we allowed the Republican Party to define us ever [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4250.04s)]
*  Before we ever started to define ourselves think about this they started right after the 20 election John as you know [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4255.76s)]
*  The Republican Party started beating the hell out of Joe Biden and the Democratic Party in all of these non-traditional [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4261.76s)]
*  Information spaces right and you've heard a lot of folks talk about it gaming platforms podcasts streaming services, right? [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4268.16s)]
*  Even online dating apps for God's sake anywhere. There's an online community [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4274.16s)]
*  The Republicans were paying micro influencers to essentially spew out their misinformation and disinformation [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4278.48s)]
*  And we didn't start in any real way our communications infrastructure until the election year [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4284.48s)]
*  We have to realize we need a permanent campaign [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4291.24s)]
*  Not only a permanent organizing campaign that's talking to voters year-round [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4294.16s)]
*  But also a permanent communications infrastructure that is not waiting until we get to an election [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4298.12s)]
*  Cycle to start communicating with voters we got beat to the punch by the Republicans who? [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4303.88s)]
*  Realized that we live in a new information environment where it's 24 7 [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4309.08s)]
*  365 and that's where we got our butts kit so for us part of this is of course the brand the other part is how we're messaging [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4313.639999999999s)]
*  The other part of is making sure we realize 40% of Americans say they avoid the news at all costs, right? [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4321.16s)]
*  Yet they're getting barraged by information and you know this better than probably anyone John [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4327.72s)]
*  They're getting barraged by information all the time on their phones [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4332.16s)]
*  So we have to be more sophisticated in how we message and when we stand up all of our operations [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4335.08s)]
*  This it's a bit of a chicken or an egg problem as well because I do think [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4340.4400000000005s)]
*  You know the Harris campaign told us this that they had a lot of [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4346.16s)]
*  influencers and influential people who were privately for [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4351.92s)]
*  Kamala Harris and Tim Walls, but didn't want to come up publicly or have them on their platforms or host them on their podcasts and [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4356.5199999999995s)]
*  That the reason that they don't is it's a brand issue, right? [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4363.24s)]
*  And I wonder how you get how you get more [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4366.28s)]
*  You basically got to get the party's brand to be more popular more accessible and cool really [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4370.76s)]
*  For a broader array of people in order to get on these platforms [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4376.96s)]
*  And I wonder how you think about that and also like part of this is you know [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4380.36s)]
*  The debate about Joe Rogan could go forever and it can be very annoying [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4384.5599999999995s)]
*  but do you think it was a mistake for Democrats to [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4388.36s)]
*  when Bernie Sanders went on Joe Rogan to criticize him for going on Joe Rogan and to [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4393.0s)]
*  Not send people on Fox News and to criticize people for going on Fox News [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4397.92s)]
*  Like do you would you like to see do you think that was a mistake? [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4402.32s)]
*  What I would say is I agree with you that we should be in all those spaces right and we shouldn't be afraid to [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4406.160000000001s)]
*  Go on Joe Rogan show or on Fox. We should be [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4412.160000000001s)]
*  confident enough in both our values and of course our message that we [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4416.4800000000005s)]
*  Go wherever we need to you know, people ask me [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4420.76s)]
*  I'm a hunter they ask me where I'm gonna go hunt right and they think I'm gonna give them my favorite hunting spot [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4423.56s)]
*  Or you know say I'm going to the woods [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4428.04s)]
*  No [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4429.88s)]
*  I go where the deer are right and you know this we need to go where voters are and you know this idea [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4430.200000000001s)]
*  That you know we have consultants in DC still spending or steering so much of our ad spend to broadcast TV [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4435.62s)]
*  I mean shoot. I'm 51 years old John, right? I'm an old man [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4442.06s)]
*  I still read a hard copy of a newspaper. But the one thing I don't do is watch broadcast TV [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4445.32s)]
*  I don't know anyone my age that watches broadcast TV yet. We still keep spending so much money on outdated tactics, right? [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4450.12s)]
*  Of course, I know why because people make all their money there, but that's wrong [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4456.78s)]
*  If we want to win again [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4460.44s)]
*  We need to realize we need to go where voters are getting their information and so that's half the battle, right? [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4461.58s)]
*  And I I think that also means we can't be afraid to go to spaces [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4467.1s)]
*  We're not going by the way. You're not going on Fox News to appeal to Republican voters, right? [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4471.66s)]
*  You're going on Fox News to appeal to independent voters, right? [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4476.54s)]
*  You're going on Joe Rogan to appeal to nonpartisans and independents not to just you know [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4479.5s)]
*  Talk to Republicans that happen to be on there [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4484.46s)]
*  So I understand people when they try to criticize someone as saying well, why would you go on Fox News? [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4486.74s)]
*  You're just going there to try to win over Republican voters. No, that's not the point [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4491.7s)]
*  There's a lot of people who listen to Fox News that aren't Republicans that we should you know, give them the countervailing opinion [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4496.34s)]
*  I think part of the challenge with social media right now is given your algorithm [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4502.7s)]
*  You're only fed the information that you want to see and so so many Americans are in this information bubble [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4507.179999999999s)]
*  That they're only getting fed the information they want and we have to try to find a way ways to break through that and that means [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4512.9s)]
*  appearing on [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4518.9s)]
*  You know environments and in platforms that might not make sense to the Democratic Party [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4520.0599999999995s)]
*  But makes sense to cut through the noise and give people a sense of what the other side actually believes [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4525.24s)]
*  You're not just a state party chair yourself. You're the president of the Association of State Democratic Committees [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4531.26s)]
*  What can state party chairs teach? [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4536.54s)]
*  National Democrats about winning elections that they're currently missing [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4539.14s)]
*  Well, here's what I would say state party chairs don't have the luxury to just focus on one race, right? [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4544.22s)]
*  We can't just focus on the governor's race or the top of the ticket [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4549.9s)]
*  We have to focus on the state legislature as well as well as other down ballot races for City Council school boards [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4553.42s)]
*  County boards, etc [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4559.94s)]
*  And so one of my critiques of the Democratic Party, especially the DNC is that they focus way too much on federal races [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4561.14s)]
*  Of course, we've got a win-back Congress the Senate and the presidency [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4568.14s)]
*  It's not an either-or but we can't be a national party that just focuses on seven battleground states, right? [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4571.820000000001s)]
*  And and some federal races we've got to be more prescriptive and holistic about how to build power around this nation [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4577.72s)]
*  That's one thing again that the conservative movement in this country realizes. They're not just focused on federal races [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4584.42s)]
*  They're also focused on school boards, right? [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4591.18s)]
*  And we've seen the dangerous result of our indifference of actually [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4593.38s)]
*  investing in trying to compete in every race in this country as a national party when the [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4597.34s)]
*  Conservative movement has taken over school boards and they're banning books and whitewashing history and attacking our children [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4602.54s)]
*  We cannot afford as a national party to ignore these public policy arenas anymore [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4608.26s)]
*  And so one thing state party chairs can teach the national party is that you have to compete everywhere [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4613.74s)]
*  the second piece is you know, you have to [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4618.38s)]
*  Make sure that you're actually building coalitions and bringing partners into that conversation, right and part of that to me [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4621.9400000000005s)]
*  State parties don't have the luxury to do this work alone because there's some of the most under [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4628.700000000001s)]
*  Resourced entities in politics. We don't get enough funding from either the national party or from others [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4635.18s)]
*  We are usually the last people getting funding [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4641.740000000001s)]
*  So that means we actually have to be smart in how we spend our money and then build coalitions with allies and [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4645.32s)]
*  organizations on the ground who are working in electoral spaces to elect people who share our values and so the third thing I would say [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4651.92s)]
*  That state parties do that the national party doesn't do which drives me crazy is state parties [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4659.179999999999s)]
*  Don't just focus on one election cycle. We have to build infrastructure that is beyond just the upcoming election cycle [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4663.88s)]
*  We have to look to [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4670.74s)]
*  628 30 and beyond right and you know, this is one of the things that I have in my plan [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4672.639999999999s)]
*  I want to write a 10-year plan for the DNC people think I'm crazy to say that but the reality is is we have to not [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4678.36s)]
*  Be my optically focused on just this election cycle because what that means is then we're recreating the infrastructure [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4685.24s)]
*  Every two or four years as a national party [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4691.24s)]
*  Look, we are part of a social we are part of a movement [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4694.0s)]
*  Of course if people are fighting for social justice and economic justice [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4697.0s)]
*  But political parties have one very clear role, right? [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4700.44s)]
*  It is our only role and it is to win elections [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4703.5599999999995s)]
*  But to do that you have to build long-lasting and durable infrastructure [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4706.5199999999995s)]
*  And that sees beyond just one election cycle [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4710.4s)]
*  And if you'll allow me to use a hockey analogy because I'm from Minnesota and Wayne Gretzky the great one right there in LA [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4713.86s)]
*  Said once that you have to skate to where the puck will be not where the puck is, right? [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4720.2s)]
*  Yet our party just keeps skating to where the puck is who's looking at the fact that in 2030 our map is gonna completely [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4724.8s)]
*  Change underneath of us as all the power shifts to the south and the southwest and who's preparing for that moment right now as we go [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4732.08s)]
*  Into 25 and 26. It should be the National Party that has a longer-term lens [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4739.400000000001s)]
*  For this work and a longer-term arc on how we do that [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4744.76s)]
*  So I guess those are the three things that state parties are doing that the national party's not doing [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4747.76s)]
*  Why do you think Minnesota got bluer since you became state party chair and how much of that do you take credit for? [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4752.4s)]
*  I take no credit for it [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4757.4s)]
*  Let me say this we've had wonderful candidates on the ballot [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4760.2s)]
*  I mean, I will never claim victory or claim credit for their victory. But what I do [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4763.28s)]
*  Claim some amount of credit for is building infrastructure that they've relied on right? [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4768.759999999999s)]
*  We've built probably the strongest state party in the nation. I'm sure there's others that would disagree but both from [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4773.16s)]
*  Fundraising and and building the infrastructure on the ground our candidates for instance [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4781.52s)]
*  All of them from governor walls to senator Klobuchar to local candidates [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4786.200000000001s)]
*  they rely on our party's infrastructure our turnout machine is is [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4790.08s)]
*  Second to none, right? We in terms of ID and and persuading mobilizing voters [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4795.08s)]
*  We always have the top voter turnout in the nation [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4800.240000000001s)]
*  If not, or we're number two or number three most importantly is that our candidates don't have to build that infrastructure [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4803.4400000000005s)]
*  Themselves they can rely on the state party to actually run the field program [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4810.92s)]
*  So they don't have to do that and I think that's why we've been winning right? I mean, there's a lot of reasons [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4814.8s)]
*  I mean but the other part of that winning is the fact that our [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4819.320000000001s)]
*  Party and our elected officials are delivering on the promises they made to voters, right? [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4823.76s)]
*  and you know [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4828.58s)]
*  there's no greater example of that than what Tim Walls and our legislative leaders did with the trifecta the last two years to actually [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4829.240000000001s)]
*  You know focus on an agenda that will help work in people that are struggling in this state and and then you know using the power [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4836.52s)]
*  They had when they had it to make a difference for those folks [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4843.24s)]
*  And you know, I think part of the disillusionment John with American politics right now [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4845.8s)]
*  As I mentioned earlier is that folks here people say one thing and then do another [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4850.54s)]
*  You know not to keep quoting Paul [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4856.16s)]
*  But Paul used to say you should never separate the life you lead from the words you speak and people see too many [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4857.92s)]
*  Politicians in both parties who stand up right say one thing just to get your vote and then get into office and forget forget about them [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4864.04s)]
*  That's why it was remarkable [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4870.76s)]
*  I think you know see what we've done in Minnesota and in states like Michigan [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4872.08s)]
*  Two very purple states in the Midwest who both had slim majorities and they led in a very aggressive way to deliver on those [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4876.72s)]
*  promises what [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4884.52s)]
*  Specifically would you do differently than Jamie Harrison over the last four years? [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4886.2s)]
*  How do you want to change the way that the DNC operates? Well first is to focus on [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4890.5599999999995s)]
*  year-round organizing [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4895.48s)]
*  Permanent campaign we you know part of the challenge of why we keep losing ground with folks as I mentioned earlier as we're only showing up [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4897.0s)]
*  Three months before an election and asking for a vote. So the first is a year-round organizing [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4903.24s)]
*  Standing up organizing all the time so we never stopped having conversations with voters at their door [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4909.2s)]
*  You know the first conversation we have with the voters should not be asking them to vote for us [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4914.2s)]
*  But rather what are your hopes and dreams your aspirations for your community, right? [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4918.36s)]
*  And then you know and over time build trust and earn their trust so we can actually ask them for their vote [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4922.32s)]
*  Second thing I would do is really contest every race up and down the ballot, right? [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4928.679999999999s)]
*  We can't be a party just focused on federal races, right? [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4932.679999999999s)]
*  And I get why Jamie had to do it and they did a lot of great work over the four years [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4936.0s)]
*  He was there and the infrastructure is much stronger than it was after the 16 election as an example [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4940.599999999999s)]
*  But I would say this for me. We need a permanent campaign [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4946.96s)]
*  We need to start our organizing and our communications infrastructure much earlier than we ever have and we have to make sure that we are [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4950.52s)]
*  Competing up and down the ballot in partnership with all of our 57 state parties all throughout the country [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4958.44s)]
*  So, you know the other thing I I would do differently and I just rolled this out this week is build a national [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4963.84s)]
*  Coordinated campaign table, right? [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4970.44s)]
*  We haven't had a national coordinated campaign at the DNC since the mid 90s and that's a shame because we're not [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4972.0s)]
*  Tapping in what does that look like? Could you yeah coordinated campaign is really bringing? [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4980.04s)]
*  Just like we do in Minnesota bringing our electoral partners and elected officials together at a table that would include [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4985.48s)]
*  allies and partners like labor and reproductive rights groups and [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4994.44s)]
*  Environmental groups and you know, we have all of these great [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=4998.599999999999s)]
*  organizations that are working in electoral spaces [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5002.5199999999995s)]
*  Spending time energy and money right fighting for economic and social justice fighting for our party and our candidates who are never engaged in that [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5005.88s)]
*  conversation right there are [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5014.0s)]
*  Siloed off and they should be brought into the conversation and we should build one plan together where we coordinate our resources and [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5016.04s)]
*  Really focus like a laser on how we build power together, right? [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5024.44s)]
*  Unfortunately right now we have all these disparate groups out there doing their own things [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5028.88s)]
*  that's really results in a lot of duplication of effort and [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5032.52s)]
*  Frankly, it does not result in us being strategically aligned in a way that helps us all accomplish the same goals [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5035.88s)]
*  Which is to elect people who share our values to office so we can actually move our agenda forward [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5042.28s)]
*  What is the permanent campaign in the year-round organizing? [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5047.72s)]
*  Give an example of like what it looks like [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5051.32s)]
*  Structurally in practice and also like where the money comes from because I feel like I've heard a lot of DNC chairs [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5054.12s)]
*  Come into the job saying like we need a 50-state campaign. We need to focus not just on national races and federal races [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5061.84s)]
*  We need to do down ballot and then when the time comes [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5069.08s)]
*  Understandably the money ends up going to the biggest most competitive races and in the most important states and that's just the way it is [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5072.24s)]
*  So how do you is that do we need to more money? [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5079.68s)]
*  Is it just where you put the money and then how does that year-round organizing actually look in practice? Yeah [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5082.08s)]
*  I mean, I think this is a very good question [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5087.84s)]
*  right and the reality is is that you have to be intentional about this and you have to make sure that your donors know that we [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5090.320000000001s)]
*  Are for us to actually turn the page here and build power [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5097.68s)]
*  We have to have a more holistic approach on it [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5101.12s)]
*  You can't just focus on seven battleground states, right? [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5103.4400000000005s)]
*  What will help us win the presidency is actually winning [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5106.28s)]
*  Local races and winning let state legislators legislatures and winning gubernatorial races, right? [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5109.719999999999s)]
*  So the reality is it's all connected and the second piece is yeah [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5115.4s)]
*  We do have to grow the pie right and part of building a coordinated campaign where we're building a permanent campaign is [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5119.12s)]
*  Realizing that we're stronger together and we should we should actually have shared resources where we're [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5125.679999999999s)]
*  Focused collectively on a plan to achieve the same goals [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5131.12s)]
*  And so when you're so disjointed and you're spending money on the left when the left hand and the right hand are talking and coordinating [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5134.24s)]
*  You're just duplicating effort and wasting resource [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5141.4400000000005s)]
*  So for me, it's just being more holistic about it [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5144.4800000000005s)]
*  And is it going to be a challenge for sure because it won't be the way the DC consultants and others want it to be [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5147.68s)]
*  We're going to flip the script [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5153.4400000000005s)]
*  We're going to break up this cabal in DC and we're gonna do things differently, right? [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5155.12s)]
*  And the model is states like Minnesota states like Wisconsin states like Michigan, right? [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5160.0s)]
*  States that are building here in the Midwest and winning right in very purple states by actually bringing people together and focusing more [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5164.84s)]
*  Holistically look if you want to keep losing keep doing things the way they are, right now as it relates to raising money [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5172.96s)]
*  You know, there's no state that's raised as much money as I have [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5179.4s)]
*  You know in addition to raising 220 million dollars for my state party [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5183.44s)]
*  I served on the Harris Walls Finance Committee raised over six million dollars for the presidential campaign did the same thing in 2016 [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5187.04s)]
*  Raising money is not going to be a challenge for me [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5195.32s)]
*  The most important thing is how we spend it and if we're not spending it on winning then we shouldn't be spending it [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5197.44s)]
*  So here's to all those consultants in DC [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5202.6s)]
*  I hope they're listening to me because if you bring me a plan that doesn't help us win elections [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5205.24s)]
*  You're gonna have to go pound sand because you're not going to get a contract from the DNC [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5209.56s)]
*  That's how we built it here and it's important not just to help us win [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5213.44s)]
*  But it's important for those donors who are giving us money to have a sense on how the DNC chair is going to approach this [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5217.0s)]
*  We're not going to invest in things that don't help us win elections. No more contracts to just line [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5223.48s)]
*  Consultants pockets as I've said I'm here to win the US out house back not help a consultant build a new house [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5229.639999999999s)]
*  How do you feel about the ban on? [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5235.4s)]
*  Corporate PACs and lobbyist donations to the DNC. Well look I mean [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5237.68s)]
*  This is a little bit of a challenging one because I do want to get dark money out of [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5242.84s)]
*  politics [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5248.360000000001s)]
*  I've long supported Ending Citizens United and making sure that we find a way to actually [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5249.56s)]
*  Overhaul the campaign finance system. So these campaigns and elections aren't as expensive [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5255.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, we've spent two and a half billion dollars on a presidential campaign over ten billion dollars, by the way, John [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5260.4400000000005s)]
*  Just in 2024 spent on the Democratic side alone. It's obscene, right? [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5265.72s)]
*  And that's got it. We've got a reverse course somehow and part of that of course is is getting money out of politics generally [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5269.88s)]
*  But when we say corporations, right? [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5276.92s)]
*  It's a very large term and this is where I start to get the devil's in the details because you know, technically [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5279.64s)]
*  by the IRS our labor partners and some of our [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5287.400000000001s)]
*  So what do we what are we actually using to define corporations? [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5291.0s)]
*  And what I would say is bad corporate actors who don't share our values [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5294.28s)]
*  The DNC should not be taking their money [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5299.400000000001s)]
*  I've been very clear on that and we don't take that type of money here in minnesota [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5302.12s)]
*  And we won't and I think at the DNC the DNC has to live its values [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5306.76s)]
*  Where there are bad corporate actors who agree with the DNC and they have to live their values [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5311.24s)]
*  The DNC has to live its values where there are bad corporate actors who again who don't share the Democratic Party's values [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5316.5199999999995s)]
*  The Democratic Party should not only not take their money. They should be calling out people who do so who are some elected Democrats? [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5323.0s)]
*  Local state national who impress you right now. Who should we be keeping an eye on? [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5330.5199999999995s)]
*  You know, I think there's a lot, you know, Maxwell Frost down in florida. I think Peggy Flanagan here in minnesota [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5334.36s)]
*  You know our lieutenant governor [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5340.919999999999s)]
*  I there's a great guy who's a was just elected as the mayor of Tulsa [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5343.0s)]
*  Monroe Nichols, who's a former state representative, right? [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5347.56s)]
*  first african-american mayor [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5351.4800000000005s)]
*  I think Sarah McBride in Delaware who's a great friend and you know, there's a lot of wonderful leaders [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5353.64s)]
*  That uh, I I think there's an amazing bench we have in the Democratic Party, right? [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5359.88s)]
*  We've got these great governors like Andy Beshear and Wes Moore and Josh Shapiro and Gretchen Whitmer, right? [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5364.28s)]
*  We've got and your governor, of course gavin newson. We've got an amazing bench [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5371.08s)]
*  But you know as I look at this [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5376.12s)]
*  We've got wonderful democratic electeds throughout this country that are serving in office right now that don't get the attention they deserve [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5378.52s)]
*  Because again, we're focused on all the big names, you know the big governors and of course the members of congress [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5386.360000000001s)]
*  But there are some amazing leaders serving in local offices that we should be paying attention to last question [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5392.84s)]
*  There's been sort of two [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5399.08s)]
*  Models for this job. There's a like someone who's going to focus on [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5400.759999999999s)]
*  Organizing and being behind the scenes and featuring a lot of the structural issues which you have talked a lot about [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5405.78s)]
*  There's also the need for a party spokesman [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5411.32s)]
*  particularly in this moment where [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5414.58s)]
*  We don't necessarily have a leader of the party right now as president biden gets ready to exit [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5417.5599999999995s)]
*  Would do you think that if you get this job you'll be [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5421.96s)]
*  Doing tv and podcasts and everything and be out there all the time being a messenger [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5425.0s)]
*  I do them all the time and it's part of your role as a state party chair, right? [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5429.88s)]
*  And certainly in my role at the asdc as a vice chair of the dnc. I i've done lots of national media [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5434.36s)]
*  That's but it's not an either or right? [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5439.799999999999s)]
*  frankly [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5442.679999999999s)]
*  I I would say we've got this great bench of elected officials many of them [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5443.799999999999s)]
*  I just talked about that we should be showcasing and using more frankly and [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5448.04s)]
*  You know that if folks think that the democratic the next chair of the democratic party is a savior that there's someone [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5452.6s)]
*  Riding in to save the party. That's the wrong mentality, right? [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5459.72s)]
*  I have a plaque in my office that says none of us are as smart as all of us [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5463.16s)]
*  And mark datin gave that to me. I believe it at the end of the day. No one has all the answers, right? [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5466.68s)]
*  But the reality is is we have this amazingly rich party of people with great professional experiences [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5471.96s)]
*  And lived experiences that we should be tapping into and that includes [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5477.72s)]
*  Spokespeople, right? I believe we've got mayors who better to talk about [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5481.72s)]
*  Public safety than mayors throughout the country, right? Who better than talk about, you know [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5486.360000000001s)]
*  Natural disasters like what we're seeing in la right now than county commissioners and leaders who have to deal with that [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5492.12s)]
*  Who better to talk about transportation funding and education funding than governors? [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5498.12s)]
*  And so I think we have many spokespeople and the dnc is not the only person who should be the spokesperson for our party [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5502.4400000000005s)]
*  So I I but I do think what we need is someone that's going to be really focused on [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5509.32s)]
*  Organizing right now what this moment needs is someone who can both get the message out [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5515.22s)]
*  But frankly focus on focusing on building the foundation we need and the infrastructure we need to win [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5520.04s)]
*  Because that's one of the lessons from this last election is clearly our comms infrastructure and our organate organizing infrastructure [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5525.8s)]
*  Is not being utilized the way it should and it's not being built in a way where it's permanent [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5532.76s)]
*  And it's part of actually moving and persuading voters [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5537.639999999999s)]
*  Ken martin, uh, thank you so much for joining pod save america and uh, and good luck to you in the race [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5540.44s)]
*  Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. John. Take care. That's our show for today [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5546.44s)]
*  Thanks to ken martin for stopping by dan and I will be back with a new show on friday [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5550.44s)]
*  Uh, stay safe everyone out there in los angeles [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5554.839999999999s)]
*  You [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIc7jcbNLmY&t=5567.48s)]
