Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

**Pod Save America:** [October 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM)
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Jon Favreau. I'm Dan Pfeiffer on today's show [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump says that January 6th was a quote day of love and [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3.96s)]
*  Tells Latino voters that the jury's still out on whether immigrants are eating pets in Springfield [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=7.98s)]
*  JD Vance finally gives an answer on whether Trump lost in 2020 [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=14.52s)]
*  We won't spoil it for you and our good friend Ben Wichler [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=18.04s)]
*  Chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party stops by to talk about how things are going in the Badger State and how you can help [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=20.92s)]
*  There and everywhere we need to win [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=27.3s)]
*  but first [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=30.5s)]
*  Kamala Harris went on Fox News and lived to tell the tale [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=32.02s)]
*  The vice president sat down with Brett Baer for an interview Wednesday night that just about everyone figured would be contentious and boy did it deliver [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=35.52s)]
*  Here's some of what just over 7 million viewers saw Wednesday night, but let's just get to the point [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=43.620000000000005s)]
*  Okay, the point is that we have a broken immigration system that needs to be repaired [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=50.78s)]
*  So your Homeland Security Secretary said that 85% of apprehensions [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=56.739999999999995s)]
*  Let me just finish. I'll get you the question. I promise you I was beginning to answer and when when you came the first bill [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=61.18s)]
*  Practically within hours of taking the oath [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=68.42s)]
*  Was a bill to fix our immigration system. Yes, ma'am. It was called the US citizen citizenship act of [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=70.97999999999999s)]
*  2021 [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=77.74s)]
*  You have to let me finish you had the White House and the House and the Senate and they didn't bring up responding [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=84.33999999999999s)]
*  To the point you're raising and I'd like to finish this man. I'm sorry and with all due respect that clip was not [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=90.17999999999999s)]
*  What he has been saying about the enemy within that he is repeated [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=97.94s)]
*  When he's speaking about the American people that's not what you just showed he was asked [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=102.61999999999999s)]
*  That's not what you just showed in all fairness [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=107.42s)]
*  Question that we asked you didn't show that and here's the bottom line [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=110.86s)]
*  He has repeated it many times and you and I both know that and you and I both know [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=114.5s)]
*  That he has talked about turning the American military on the American people [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=120.22s)]
*  He has talked about going after people who are engaged in peaceful protest [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=124.14s)]
*  He's talked about locking people up because they disagree with him [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=128.85999999999999s)]
*  This is a democracy and in a democracy [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=133.57999999999998s)]
*  The president of the United States in the United States of America should be willing to be able to handle [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=137.5s)]
*  Criticism without saying he'd lock people up for doing it. And this is what is at stake. Hell, yes [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=145.14s)]
*  Fucking I want it. I want to go grab my ballot and just drop it off right now [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=152.78s)]
*  You can you literally can do that. I can't find it. That's the whole thing [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=157.57999999999998s)]
*  Emily got hers. I don't know where mine is. Anyway, what did you think? What do you think of the whole interview? I [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=162.94s)]
*  Loved it it was I have to say there was a big proponent of [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=169.85999999999999s)]
*  Democrats going on Fox News, you know [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=174.78s)]
*  well [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=176.62s)]
*  there is a like a little PTSD for me here because back in 2010 I [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=176.98s)]
*  Pushed very hard for Barack Obama to do an interview with Brett bear when you're trying to pass the Affordable Care Act [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=181.26s)]
*  Because we had all these members in Republican districts. We were trying to get to the support the support Obamacare and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=186.18s)]
*  We did that interview Brett bear interrupted Barack Obama very similar to this 16 times in 20 minutes [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=191.9s)]
*  And I would say the walk from the East Wing where the interview was conducted back to the West Wing [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=196.76s)]
*  Was one of the longer walks of my life? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=203.26s)]
*  Was he really mad at you? No, he was more just he I say he was disappointed was the word I would say [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=206.38s)]
*  He just said well that was fun [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=213.42000000000002s)]
*  And then we just walked in silence for a long time I don't remember that interview but was he as firm and still [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=219.02s)]
*  Polite as Kamala Harris was like I thought she really she could have she was great. She handled that back harder [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=226.38000000000002s)]
*  She was like she was tough, but she didn't go it was perfect. I thought I thought her tone. Yeah perfect [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=232.54000000000002s)]
*  She was she was great [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=238.42000000000002s)]
*  She called out the bullshit which I think is one thing you have to do when you go on Fox News as a Democrat [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=240.34s)]
*  Is she it is what Pete Buttigieg is great at Kevin Newsom is great at is you call out the game and when Brett bear just [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=244.72s)]
*  Fucking leading with his large chin [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=251.2s)]
*  it just [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=254.18s)]
*  We're playing the wrong clip to clean up Donald Trump's mess like the like the lackey that he is [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=256.06s)]
*  Yeah, we're easier for to do that. We should say for people at home. What happened was [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=261.46s)]
*  They brought up Trump's comments on enemy they were talking about Trump's comments where he talked about the enemy within [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=267.14s)]
*  which he said on a Fox News program to Maria Bartiromo on Sunday and [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=274.14s)]
*  Bear played the didn't play that clip of Trump talking to Maria Bartiromo, but played the clip of Trump responding to that clip [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=280.86s)]
*  when he was asked a question about it at another Fox News town hall and gave a [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=289.14s)]
*  Bullshit II reply that really was just a bunch of lies and craziness from Trump [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=294.29999999999995s)]
*  and so just never played the actual clip because [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=298.7s)]
*  Fox had probably been trying to hide the actual clip from their audience ever since they originally aired it when Trump was talking to Maria Bartiromo [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=301.02s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. Just mask mask off moment as someone wrote today [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=309.21999999999997s)]
*  so [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=314.58s)]
*  Overall you think it was worth doing Fox News [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=315.85999999999996s)]
*  I [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=318.66s)]
*  Met net positive net neutral net negative. I don't I think we both know not negative. But what do you think strong net positive? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=320.14000000000004s)]
*  And like as you said, I generally counsel Democrats to not go on Fox News like you like you did to me [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=326.22s)]
*  Yeah, like I did to you and look [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=332.94000000000005s)]
*  Worked good worked great for you. You have a new best friend at Jesse waters [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=336.18s)]
*  And but this was one of those times where it made sense and here's why it was worth it [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=340.22s)]
*  Seven point one million people watch this interview that is more than three times Brett bears normal audience [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=344.48s)]
*  Do you know what the number one market in the country was in terms of watching that interview? Oh what? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=349.8s)]
*  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania my friend. Yeah [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=354.4s)]
*  Love that. Yeah, and it's it's clear David Ploff said this to me on Potsdamerica of the weekend [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=356.72s)]
*  But one of their targets is Republican leaning [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=362.28000000000003s)]
*  independent and soft Republicans [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=365.36s)]
*  That's a group. She has made progress with she's up to nine percent of Republicans in the latest time sienna poll [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=367.24s)]
*  And this is a great way to reach those voters like it the best media moments are ones where the candidate performs [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=372.7s)]
*  well [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=378.21999999999997s)]
*  the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=378.58s)]
*  Platform is chosen because it speaks directly to a voter target and you do so well that the clips will go viral on [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=379.38s)]
*  Tick tock and Instagram and will reach voters who did not actually tune it on all three marks. She hit those here [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=386.5s)]
*  Yeah, and I just it got outsized media coverage because it was like, you know Kamala Harris goes into the Lions down [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=391.53999999999996s)]
*  In Sam's who's we know who's a Harris campaign spokesman told Brian Stelter on his podcast that they did the interview for two reasons [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=397.9s)]
*  one because they believe a considerable number of undecided voters watch Fox and [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=406.21999999999997s)]
*  To to knock down the lies they tell on Fox. Do you think those are both? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=410.7s)]
*  That's that's right. Yeah, I think the most the more important and larger reason was [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=416.94s)]
*  The meta message of she is strong enough and tough enough to go in to a network that is [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=422.18s)]
*  Actively working to elect your opponent take the tough questions that Donald Trump is too scared to do an interview with anyone serious [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=429.02s)]
*  Like that's the that's what's ultimately what you're trying to achieve here larger than who the individual people were who watched the specific [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=434.46s)]
*  interview in that moment I [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=439.82s)]
*  Checked out the latest New York Times sienna poll [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=442.02s)]
*  the national one where she's up three and I looked at the media consumption question at the very end and [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=444.9s)]
*  Ten percent of voters who aren't yet supporting Trump or Harris get their news from Fox [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=451.05999999999995s)]
*  Which was like the third high 15 percent said social media [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=458.94s)]
*  Ten percent said local news ten percent said Fox and then every other news source was in the low single digits [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=462.7s)]
*  So it is you know, it's there is some I don't know how many but there are some people watching Fox and also Fox is on [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=468.26s)]
*  Especially if you get out of blue cities Fox is on it's like the the network that's on like a doctor's office or a store [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=475.08000000000004s)]
*  Or an air, you know [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=481.88s)]
*  And so there's some people who aren't like Fox fans, but they just like have Fox on and they're not all [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=482.72s)]
*  Maga people right like most of them are but not all of them [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=489.36s)]
*  It's the background music in a lot of communities right like you go to get your oil changed [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=492.56s)]
*  It's what's on there the doctor's office now the thing that's always hard and one of the reasons why I [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=496.24s)]
*  Often counsel Democrats not to go on is that you can handle your individual interview great, but Fox will take whatever [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=500.84s)]
*  The worst clips are and then they'll play those all day long but that [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=508.2s)]
*  But you know what they'll do that if they didn't have a clip from Fox to do that [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=511.96s)]
*  Yeah, they do that about her on any other issue, right? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=515.6s)]
*  And she reached seven million people doing it right normally if you're just a normal Democrat you do it [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=518.1999999999999s)]
*  You just get the specific audience of that show midday and then they can beat you up with it here [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=522.0s)]
*  She obviously brought in a whole bunch of people and the people who tuned in are people who are able to turn on Fox and be [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=527.96s)]
*  Interested enough to hear what she has to say. So those are potential voters for her other thing too is [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=534.12s)]
*  She at one point in that exchange about enemy from within she talked about General Mark Milley who Donald Trump [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=540.28s)]
*  handpicked to be his [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=547.8s)]
*  Joint chiefs of staff chairman of the Joint Chiefs and how he told Bob Woodward that [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=550.28s)]
*  Donald Trump is fascist to the core and [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=556.0400000000001s)]
*  She brought that up and then you know, Brett was like, oh, yeah. Yeah, he did tell that to Bob Woodward and [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=558.64s)]
*  That was apparently according to the bulwark only the third time [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=564.2s)]
*  Fox told his audience that [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=569.44s)]
*  Mark Milley called Donald Trump fascist to its core [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=572.2s)]
*  That's the third time that happened one was from Kamala Harris one was from [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=575.84s)]
*  Jessica Tarlove on the five and one was I forget when else it happened [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=580.24s)]
*  But that was it three times since this happened. It's been like a couple weeks [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=585.12s)]
*  Just or else how we gonna have fair and balanced journalist over there at Fox News [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=588.48s)]
*  But that is another reason why you go on there is that you expose [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=592.64s)]
*  Fox viewers to facts that they have not heard not just like correcting lies, but just things that they've never heard [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=596.0s)]
*  I thought the interview was also an opportunity for Kamala to answer some of the trickier questions [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=601.64s)]
*  She either hasn't answered or hasn't answered. Well, she was asked about the Trump campaigns accusations [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=606.96s)]
*  Which they have put 20 million dollars of ads behind [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=613.0200000000001s)]
*  That she supported gender affirming care for undocumented immigrants who are incarcerated [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=616.98s)]
*  She pointed out that it is the law [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=623.7s)]
*  These are court decisions that have required this in prisons [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=626.9000000000001s)]
*  And so it's not like just some policy she's been pushing and she pointed out [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=630.24s)]
*  This is reported in the New York Times this week [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=634.34s)]
*  That that kind of care was also offered under the woke administration of Donald Trump [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=636.46s)]
*  So I thought that was she handled that and then she was asked the question about about Biden [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=642.66s)]
*  That tripped her up on the view. Let's listen. It's interesting. You said turn the page madam vice president [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=649.18s)]
*  You were asked on two different shows last week. What if anything you would do differently than President Biden? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=653.92s)]
*  Here's what you said. You're not Joe Biden. You're not Donald Trump, but but nothing comes to mind that you would do differently [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=658.46s)]
*  let me be very clear my presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden's presidency and [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=664.18s)]
*  Like every new president that comes in to office I will bring my life experiences [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=670.14s)]
*  My professional experiences and fresh and new ideas. I represent a new generation of leadership. I [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=676.82s)]
*  For example and someone who has not spent the majority of my career in Washington DC. I invite [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=683.62s)]
*  ideas whether it be from the Republicans who are supporting me who were just on stage with me minutes ago and [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=690.54s)]
*  The business sector and others who can contribute how do you think she handled it this time? I would say much better [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=696.94s)]
*  much better [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=705.34s)]
*  I mean her answer is interesting because she obviously [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=706.7800000000001s)]
*  improves upon the nothing comes to mind answer which is now starring in a [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=710.3000000000001s)]
*  Pretty brutal ad that the Trump campaign is pouring money in in the battleground states. I sent it too early. I hope you didn't click [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=714.1s)]
*  No, I just saw Tommy respond boy. That's brutal and I decided [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=720.1s)]
*  Honestly debated whether to send that to you or not [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=726.62s)]
*  But you can just let you because we don't have a dollar state [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=730.3000000000001s)]
*  You just live in blissful ignorance for the next three weeks without knowing that was up there [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=732.62s)]
*  but so she she answered it much better and the other thing I thought was interesting about the answer is [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=736.98s)]
*  she [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=742.98s)]
*  Spoke to two groups of people right and there there isn't it two interrelated groups, but one are people who are [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=744.74s)]
*  dissatisfied with the present [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=751.34s)]
*  Conditions of America under Joe Biden as unfair as that may be to all the many great things Joe Biden has accomplished [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=753.34s)]
*  There's a lot of people who think that he has a little approval ratings and you have [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=758.0600000000001s)]
*  Wrong track numbers that are you know above 60? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=762.02s)]
*  but she also by simply saying my presence is not a continuation of Joe Biden, but then she pivots and says but I have not [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=765.0600000000001s)]
*  spent my career in Washington and [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=771.1s)]
*  That is speaking to the people who? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=773.46s)]
*  Are mad about politics generally that she is an outsider right in general [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=776.58s)]
*  Outsider candidates do quite well and she can't be a true outsider because she is literally the city of my suppose United States [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=781.1s)]
*  But she does have a unique biography and a unique background and the person she's running against is not necessarily an outsider because he was the former [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=787.38s)]
*  President United States [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=794.22s)]
*  So I thought just that pivot to I didn't spend my career in Washington was notable and interesting [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=794.9000000000001s)]
*  if she gets it again, like I think there's a way for her to do this that is [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=799.9000000000001s)]
*  It's not even that critical of Joe Biden, right? It's just like, you know, Joe Biden [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=805.34s)]
*  Had to when Joe Biden and I took office had to deal with an economic crisis caused by the pandemic and [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=810.5s)]
*  He did that pulled the economy out of recession, but now our problem. It's a new time new problem costs are too high [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=816.9000000000001s)]
*  So I'm gonna build 3 million affordable [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=823.86s)]
*  Homes and I'm gonna crack down on price gouging and I'm gonna expand Medicare to cover her home care, right? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=826.62s)]
*  Whatever her economic plan is so she can and and I actually saw that [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=832.6600000000001s)]
*  Blueprint polling tested these and some of the ones that tested the best on some of the answers that tested the best on separating [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=836.26s)]
*  Yourself from Biden. It's not really saying like oh Joe Biden did this wrong and I'm gonna do this [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=842.5s)]
*  It's just like you know what new person new time new challenges [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=846.82s)]
*  And here's what I'm gonna focus on now, right? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=851.14s)]
*  Like Joe Biden's thing was get us out of the pandemic get the economy back on track and my thing is now [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=852.96s)]
*  Costs are too high and so I'm gonna bring them down [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=858.1800000000001s)]
*  I think I think a little granularity on [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=860.0600000000001s)]
*  Ideas and policies that she's gonna pursue in connection to that answer is gonna be helpful [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=863.46s)]
*  Yeah, it's just it is just you have to think about an opportunity [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=868.38s)]
*  You make the initial statement that my president's in at presidency will not be continuation of Joe Biden's and then it's just an opportunity [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=871.1800000000001s)]
*  To restate your popular policy agenda. Yeah, because they're idle [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=876.22s)]
*  I think you have to be careful not to play the press this game here [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=879.58s)]
*  Which they also read that and were like well, he didn't she didn't really distinguish herself. What would you do differently? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=881.9s)]
*  What did he do wrong and I just think there's too much drama that comes with that and it's too much of an inside baseball [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=886.14s)]
*  For the actual voters. Well, she's also I mean it just there's an there's a [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=892.34s)]
*  Honesty issue there too, which is like she was there right? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=897.0600000000001s)]
*  So you can't the next if she says like oh Joe Biden made this decision and I wouldn't have made it then you really well [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=900.22s)]
*  What did you tell him at the time that it was wrong? Yeah, it's just it opens it can't you can't go down that now [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=905.94s)]
*  So before she sat down with Brit Bear [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=911.5400000000001s)]
*  Harris appeared in Washington crossing, Pennsylvania where George Washington famously crossed the Delaware Dan [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=913.86s)]
*  And she was there with more than a hundred Republican lawmakers and government officials who she said [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=919.66s)]
*  Put country first by endorsing her including former House members Adam Kinzinger and Barbara Comstock [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=925.6999999999999s)]
*  What do you think of how she's using Republicans to make the case? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=931.42s)]
*  and and [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=935.74s)]
*  Do you think that is gonna be effective in reaching some of those voters? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=937.18s)]
*  We were talking about who maybe tuned into the the Brett Bayer interview who might be, you know [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=941.9399999999999s)]
*  Right-leaning independents or Republicans who are done with Trump and highly polarized times people's political identity is their primary identity [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=947.12s)]
*  That's how they see themselves. That's how they sort themselves with their friends [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=954.86s)]
*  And so to break from that and to do something that runs counter to that identity is hard [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=958.06s)]
*  And the way you get people to do that is you show lots of other people doing the same thing [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=963.3s)]
*  This is why you bring a hundred Republicans on stage [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=967.06s)]
*  It's why Sarah Longwell's group is running [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=969.5s)]
*  Videos running ads with videos of people speaking direct Republicans speaking directly to camera saying I voted for Trump [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=972.4200000000001s)]
*  But this time I'm not for these reasons. And so this is this is how you do it Trump is doing the opposite [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=977.5s)]
*  I just saw before we got on here Trump doing a at a barbershop in the Bronx sitting with a bunch of black men [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=983.1800000000001s)]
*  Talking just sort of shooting the shit with them just cuz you you he's trying to do the same thing with a different group of voters [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=991.26s)]
*  And to show that you know, the waters warm there are other people like you here [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=996.88s)]
*  And so it's a smart savvy understanding the way politics works these days. Also, I think there's there's two [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=999.84s)]
*  Target demos they're trying to reach here. There's people who don't always vote and there's people who don't always vote for Democrats [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1005.96s)]
*  And I think the Harris walls campaign is obviously going after both groups [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1012.16s)]
*  But it is harder to reach the people who don't always vote right and they are [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1016.68s)]
*  They are not as dependable and they are low-propensity voters and it's gonna take more resources to find them [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1020.64s)]
*  to convince them to come out to the polls [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1026.8s)]
*  and I'm sure they're doing that but the thing about the [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1028.9199999999998s)]
*  People who don't always vote for Democrats whether they're independent or Republicans who are open to voting for Democrats is they are very reliable voters and [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1032.44s)]
*  They show up in a lot of these elections. And so I'm guessing the campaign's thinking [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1040.0s)]
*  All right [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1043.56s)]
*  It's probably a more bang for our buck to let go after some of these soft Republicans right-leaning [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1043.84s)]
*  independents who and Donald Trump has made them [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1049.28s)]
*  Available to the Harris campaign because he's so extreme that wouldn't usually happen in a campaign for a Democratic campaign [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1052.72s)]
*  But Donald Trump has made it more possible this time [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1058.84s)]
*  I can't remember if I use these numbers on this podcast or one of these seven other podcasts we've done recently, but [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1061.1999999999998s)]
*  You know blueprint also pulled Haley voters and there's a large chunk of Haley voters who are not with Trump yet and are open [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1067.48s)]
*  To the idea of supporting Harris and but she's got work to do but just to put that number in perspective [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1074.36s)]
*  76,000 [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1080.04s)]
*  People voted for Nikki Haley in the Wisconsin primary in 2020 Joe Biden won Wisconsin by 21,000 votes [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1081.32s)]
*  Yeah, you know, obviously you're not gonna get all of them [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1086.76s)]
*  You probably aren't gonna get most of them [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1089.36s)]
*  But that's it [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1090.8s)]
*  That's a big chunk of voters who could decide the election and the numbers are similar in the other battleground states, right? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1091.28s)]
*  So we learned today about two other Republicans who've decided to level their critiques of Trump in private like a couple of profiles and courage [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1096.84s)]
*  Mitch McConnell who apparently participated in oral history project oral history of a [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1104.6399999999999s)]
*  Slowly degrading democracy [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1110.64s)]
*  I don't know what the project was but he's he's on an audio recording calling Trump after January 6th [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1112.28s)]
*  Quote stupid a narcissist and a despicable human being [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1119.48s)]
*  No word on when that recording will be available [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1124.64s)]
*  But it was it's a book that journalists Mike Tackett is is writing and so the AP reported it today [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1127.16s)]
*  When asked by the Associated Press about these comments McConnell said quote [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1133.92s)]
*  Whatever I may have said about President Trump pales in comparison to what JD Vance Lindsey Graham and others have said about him [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1139.0s)]
*  But we're all on the same team now [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1145.7s)]
*  You know what? I respect it. I truly respect that response [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1148.44s)]
*  Yeah, he is one of history's great villains and cowards, but I respect their response there [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1153.64s)]
*  Meanwhile our pal Tim Miller broke some news over the bulwark about former Trump Defense Secretary James Mattis [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1159.52s)]
*  On Tim's bulwark podcast Bob Woodward revealed that Mattis emailed him to say that he agrees with [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1166.2s)]
*  General Mark Milley's assessment the Trump is quote the most dangerous person ever [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1173.28s)]
*  So thanks to both Jim Mattis and Mitch McConnell stepping up when it really matters, huh? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1179.24s)]
*  Come on people say it out loud in front of a camera [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1186.2s)]
*  Just cow it's it's pure [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1190.64s)]
*  Cowardice to sit there and believe that a [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1193.24s)]
*  Fascist someone you believe is a fascist a dangerous fascist is on the cusp of becoming president [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1196.72s)]
*  I'd say it's in your responses to email Bob Woodward after his book comes out [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1201.92s)]
*  Hey, Bob, maybe you put this in your next one in [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1206.6000000000001s)]
*  2026 [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1209.3600000000001s)]
*  I don't know man. I don't know. Are these these revelations something that the Harris campaign should be using down the homestead? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1211.48s)]
*  She's already in her rallies all this week. She's been talking about the Milley comments, which I think is very smart [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1219.1599999999999s)]
*  I think I think when your opponents a former top general that they hired [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1225.1999999999998s)]
*  Is running around telling people that the opponents a fascist the most dangerous person to ever exist and stuff like a four-star general [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1232.36s)]
*  I think that's useful the useful knowledge for people [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1239.84s)]
*  It is it mean obviously it's useful and it's a piece of information that every voter should have before they make their decision [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1243.52s)]
*  Seems like you should put it should be in the voter guide frankly [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1249.76s)]
*  We've talked about this before these are hard arguments to sell to a lot of [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1253.6799999999998s)]
*  voters particularly ones who are not super engaged with the news on daily basis because [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1258.2399999999998s)]
*  They were alive for the last Trump presidency and they didn't see it as fascist [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1262.1599999999999s)]
*  And so that it's just it'd be much more powerful on camera, but it just is a you should talk about it for sure [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1266.2399999999998s)]
*  It should be part of the argument as we raise the stakes [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1271.8799999999999s)]
*  But recognizing that it's hard to convince people of something that Trump will be a dictator will be a fascist because they believe he was [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1273.88s)]
*  Not now you can get some granularity to it that is and you need this is the you see this in their ads a little [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1280.72s)]
*  Bit where it's like Trump has changed. He's less stable. You do that you talk about this a lot [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1287.16s)]
*  He's got different people around him. You got to do the whole story for people to understand [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1290.8000000000002s)]
*  Why this time would be different than last time because last time is we had a kind of embarrassing president didn't seem great at his job [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1294.96s)]
*  Eggs were cheap then something really bad happened those beyond his control in America got fucked up. He fired him now. He's back, right? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1301.42s)]
*  Yeah, I mean look I think this is appealing to me [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1307.22s)]
*  Not necessarily because we're trying to convince people [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1310.8200000000002s)]
*  The Donald Trump is a fascist who don't already think that he's a fascist or a dictator or whatever you may want to do [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1314.0200000000002s)]
*  I do agree that [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1318.98s)]
*  You have to frame it as the guy since you last saw him is different. He is older crazier more unhinged [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1321.66s)]
*  The guy has lost a step clearly. He's swaying and dancing at his events [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1331.38s)]
*  He's you know, he's saying he's gonna use the military against people. He's nuts. He's lost it, right? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1336.6200000000001s)]
*  Like I think that is the argument you have to make but I think I think one of the most effective [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1342.0600000000002s)]
*  Arguments here is that so many people that have worked [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1348.14s)]
*  For Donald Trump at the most senior levels [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1353.38s)]
*  Do not think he is fit for office like so blueprint also did a test of all closing arguments, which was the most effective [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1356.46s)]
*  Number one most effective argument it boosted Kamala Harris 12 points with all voters and 14 points with independence [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1364.3s)]
*  It says nearly half of Trump's cabinet have refused to endorse him when Trump learned during the Capitol [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1371.46s)]
*  Riot that his supporters were threatening to kill his own vice president [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1377.06s)]
*  He said so what and refused to do anything to ensure the vice president was safe [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1380.1799999999998s)]
*  Republican governors senators and House members have all said the same thing. We can't give Trump another four years of president [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1384.5s)]
*  So it was the number one most effective closing argument number two was abortion [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1390.2199999999998s)]
*  Close behind it that boosted her 10 and 12 with independence [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1393.54s)]
*  And then after that an argument about Social Security and what Trump would do on Social Security and what Trump would do on ACA [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1397.06s)]
*  That boosted her six points and then everything else was like in the single digits or negative [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1402.8999999999999s)]
*  But those those were the best arguments closing arguments against Trump and I found that with independence, right? [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1408.0s)]
*  No with all well the first number I read was all voters and then the second one was independence [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1413.22s)]
*  Yeah, so it's pretty you know [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1417.1s)]
*  I I just think that people if you don't know much about whatever you don't have to make the argument that he's a fascist [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1419.1399999999999s)]
*  Like hey see these generals see these defense secretaries national security advisors Mike Pence. They're all like no. No, don't do it. Don't do it [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1424.8999999999999s)]
*  We're I would say that right now. We're standing at the crossroads of a very large [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1432.3799999999999s)]
*  Debate within the Democratic political community right now about how best to close this race. Yeah, that is one argument [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1437.66s)]
*  I'm sure the other one. Yeah, let's talk about price gouging. No, no, no, it's not like it's not [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1444.74s)]
*  It's not love you know how much I love talking about price guy. Yeah. Yeah [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1449.5400000000002s)]
*  I mean you are you know when he's price gouging more than you [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1452.3000000000002s)]
*  You're the guy and I'm still angry at the nerds that [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1457.18s)]
*  Policy nerds that don't think it's a good. It's a good hit [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1461.14s)]
*  It's really I think between the first argument on that list and the second one which is a more focus on abortion than anything else [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1463.48s)]
*  abortion the abortion economy and it's basically [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1472.68s)]
*  Take everything that has been every dollar in cents and ounce of blood sweat tears has been put in building up where Kamala Harris is [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1475.64s)]
*  Right now and putting that into one argument as opposed to sort of a shift at the end here [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1481.72s)]
*  Which this is a shift from us. It is a shift. I mean I'm not saying I'm not waiting in here [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1485.96s)]
*  I want to see more data [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1491.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1493.4399999999998s)]
*  Don't know I could I could craft an argument that gets it all together [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1495.4799999999998s)]
*  I mean it's like you start with you start with Trump you start with the fact that he has lost a step [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1497.9599999999998s)]
*  He is unstable. He is unhinged and then you go through all the policies right like he you know [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1504.04s)]
*  He was always anti-choice [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1511.02s)]
*  But now he wants to have a national abortion ban and leave in place Trump bands that have led women to die [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1512.6799999999998s)]
*  He was always for tariffs now. He wants to slap 20% tariffs on everything [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1520.1s)]
*  We buy that's imported iPhones tequila cars everything else [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1525.34s)]
*  He was always sort of crazy, but now he wants to turn the military on a man [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1528.1s)]
*  You know like I think you go down the list that way your your your fingers work you here [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1532.4199999999998s)]
*  I'll kind of deal with you you write that down [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1536.4599999999998s)]
*  I'll put it I'll put it in a very popular political newsletter called the message box okay cool [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1538.26s)]
*  I can guess right a message box or you know I know you don't write anymore [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1543.54s)]
*  So just send me a voice memo, and I will [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1547.9s)]
*  Do this podcast maybe someone could take notes [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1551.14s)]
*  Donald Trump he did this this Univision town hall this week it aired Wednesday night [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1556.26s)]
*  Surprise surprise was a lot more challenging than his Fox News women's town hall [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1561.94s)]
*  Which it turns out was actually stalked with Trump supporters. Oh what a surprise couldn't tell that from the fucking town hall [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1566.7s)]
*  I watched five minutes of it when I walked in the office yesterday, and I was like this is embarrassing [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1572.42s)]
*  I think Kamala Harris would have gotten tougher questions from her own staff [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1576.9s)]
*  Then oh yeah, I take that as a strong guess [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1582.1000000000001s)]
*  Then the questions that they got I want one woman literally stood up [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1585.42s)]
*  And she was just like I just want to thank you for everything you're doing to to stop the woke military [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1589.3400000000001s)]
*  There a question here [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1596.74s)]
*  but anyway the Univision town hall excellent questions and [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1598.7800000000002s)]
*  There were some people who had voted for Donald Trump and had been at Republicans in the town hall asked some questions [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1602.18s)]
*  including this man let's listen I am a [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1609.7s)]
*  Republican no longer registered. I want to give you the opportunity to try to win back [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1613.86s)]
*  my vote [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1619.3799999999999s)]
*  Okay [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1620.7s)]
*  your [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1622.3799999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna say action and maybe in action during your presidency and the last few years [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1623.74s)]
*  Sort of you know was a little disturbing to me. You know what happened during January 6 [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1631.06s)]
*  And the fact that you know you waited so long to take action while your supporters were attacking the Capitol [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1638.46s)]
*  I'm curious how people so close to you and your administration [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1644.58s)]
*  No longer want to support you, so why would I want to support you? [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1648.3799999999999s)]
*  If you would answer these questions for me, I would really appreciate it and give you the opportunity [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1652.3799999999999s)]
*  There's you know your own vice president doesn't want to support you now. Thank you [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1656.5400000000002s)]
*  so [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1661.46s)]
*  The people that don't support a very small portion [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1662.5400000000002s)]
*  We have a tremendous about 97 percent of the people in the administration support me [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1665.5400000000002s)]
*  But because it's me somebody doesn't support they get a little publicity [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1671.18s)]
*  The vice president I disagree with him on what he did. I totally disagreed with him on what he did very importantly you had [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1675.38s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of people come to Washington. They didn't come because of me they came because of the election [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1683.9s)]
*  They thought the election was a rigged election, and that's why they came some of those people went down to the Capitol [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1688.94s)]
*  I said peacefully and patriotically nothing done wrong at all nothing done wrong and [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1695.28s)]
*  Action was taken strong action Ashley Babbitt was killed nobody was killed [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1701.58s)]
*  There were no guns down there. We didn't have guns the others had guns [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1706.74s)]
*  But we didn't have guns and when I say we these are people that walked down [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1710.18s)]
*  This was a tiny percentage of the overall which nobody sees and nobody nobody shows [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1714.02s)]
*  But that was a day of love from the standpoint of the millions [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1719.38s)]
*  It's like hundreds of thousands it could have been the largest group. I've ever spoken before they asked me to speak [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1723.3s)]
*  I went and I spoke day of love day of love Dan. They tried to wanted to hang the vice president [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1729.42s)]
*  They were hunting Nancy Pelosi [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1735.66s)]
*  Police officers were beaten within an inch of their lives [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1738.46s)]
*  Bombs pipe bombs and by the way they did have guns [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1742.7s)]
*  maybe Trump didn't have a gun but because he did say we but [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1746.74s)]
*  They had guns and Trump knew they had guns which we learned in the January 6th committee investigation that he said yeah [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1750.66s)]
*  They have guns, but they're not gonna hurt me so who cares let him through the magnetometers [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1757.22s)]
*  That was the quote from so Trump knew that they were armed with guns. We knew he was lying [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1760.94s)]
*  But it was a day of love the day of love what you think of that exchange [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1765.78s)]
*  Honestly, holy fucking shit. I know [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1769.98s)]
*  It what are we doing? I? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1772.7s)]
*  Mean it is truly an insane thing to say [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1776.06s)]
*  This is his biggest vulnerability in election if I gliss is that's also his biggest legal liability is that is January 6 [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1780.9s)]
*  Yeah, it is incredibly unpopular [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1787.58s)]
*  Even even most Republicans don't support what happened on that day. It was an act of absolute violence of [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1790.78s)]
*  Domestic terrorism and Donald Trump calls it a day of love like 20 days before the election [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1797.46s)]
*  Where it's like oh crazy Trump just talking again [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1803.5s)]
*  Like why like just something is like something is seriously broken in [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1806.94s)]
*  It is the media environment. It is our own attention span. I saw you tweeting this today that like how is this not the biggest? [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1812.1799999999998s)]
*  story like [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1819.06s)]
*  Jim Comey put out a letter saying oh [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1821.1399999999999s)]
*  There was a couple more emails from Hillary we're looking into and it upended the entire fucking election for the last couple weeks [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1824.02s)]
*  Don't maybe civilization [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1830.22s)]
*  civilization Donald Trump is is waiting to [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1832.46s)]
*  Possibly stand trial because he's been indicted for trying to overturn the last election and foment a violent insurrection [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1836.06s)]
*  And then goes back to it in town hall and says it was the day of love [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1843.26s)]
*  What it is there should be anything else for the next couple two weeks? [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1847.34s)]
*  Why is not every Republican being asked of January 6th of the day of love all those ones who were on all the video the documentary? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1851.98s)]
*  Video footage running for their fucking lives desperately calling the White House to try to get help [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1857.78s)]
*  It's just it is a blip and it is [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1862.86s)]
*  Like it it's not anyone's fault. It is a structural problem in our democracy right now that is it just [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1866.78s)]
*  But it's that structural problem which is kind of why we're in this mess right now is [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1874.18s)]
*  Just highlighted by the fact that he can say that and it's just we've just moved on and it happens not 24 hours ago [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1878.46s)]
*  Yeah [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1885.3400000000001s)]
*  Well, fortunately Kamala Harris jumped on this today in Wisconsin. Let's listen to what she said [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1887.1000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump was at a Univision town hall where a voter asked him about January 6th [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1892.0600000000002s)]
*  Okay [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1900.74s)]
*  So now we here know January 6th was a tragic day [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1901.98s)]
*  It was a day of terrible violence and what did Donald Trump? [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1906.94s)]
*  Say last night about January 6th [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1912.6200000000001s)]
*  He called it a quote a day of love [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1916.58s)]
*  But but it points out something that everyone here knows [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1926.94s)]
*  The American people are exhausted with his gaslighting [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1931.06s)]
*  What you think of that can't you a question as a [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1941.78s)]
*  Once and potentially future wordsmith. Yes. Do you think people know what gaslighting means? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1945.18s)]
*  I did not enjoy gaslighting the word guy [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1950.14s)]
*  I think it is a resistance term from 2017 that has been overused and the now people bunch of people use it all the time [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1953.32s)]
*  This is a correct usage. I would use it. Correct. Absolutely [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1960.5s)]
*  Yes, but many people have used it in such wrong ways that it's sort of I don't know if it's that he's I guess [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1963.98s)]
*  I don't know if the criticism is that he's gaslighting necessarily [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1970.78s)]
*  The criticism is that like he thinks that attacking the seat of government a bunch of people violently attacking the seat of government was a day [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1973.3s)]
*  of love [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1980.1399999999999s)]
*  That he was responsible for that. He is currently under indictment for like he he is not fit to be president [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1981.4199999999998s)]
*  He's not fit to be president. He should be I think there's just [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1986.5s)]
*  One more turn of the argument there, right? We're either it's a combination of he's dangerous and or delusional [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1989.34s)]
*  Right. Yes, right, right because we're yes, but exactly the frame that he has he has lost it [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=1995.5s)]
*  You know, it's the same [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2001.6599999999999s)]
*  dancing up on stage [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2003.4599999999998s)]
*  Swaying back and forth thinking about he's mad king, you know, it's just it's I don't know. I don't know [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2006.06s)]
*  Like do they push this do they keep pushing it? [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2011.9799999999998s)]
*  Like I can imagine they put I was tweeting I was like how long until someone has Donald Trump's answer and [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2015.2199999999998s)]
*  side by side with the video [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2022.98s)]
*  Videos from January 6 where cops are just getting assaulted and people getting hurt and sure enough [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2025.3799999999999s)]
*  There's Harris campaign like in a couple hours put out that video like is it an ad you run an ad about it? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2030.6999999999998s)]
*  Does she bring it up in an interview? Like what do you think? I don't know. It's hard to do [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2036.7199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I think she should bring it up all the time [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2041.1s)]
*  Just I mean part of this is not a harken back to the previous debate, but there is what there is your final closing message [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2042.62s)]
*  But there's also you just have to be on offense every day for the next 20 days here 18 days or whatever [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2049.2599999999998s)]
*  It is we have left. Yeah, and this is one way in which you do that [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2054.02s)]
*  And so every day you're doing all these rallies you're mixing new stuff in and I think just like [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2056.74s)]
*  Sticking with making this part of the pitch at the end here is is good [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2061.3399999999997s)]
*  I mean look, there's only so many ads that can run between now and Election Day [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2065.02s)]
*  So switching that out for something else you already because there's already traffic on now and they it has to bleed through all of its [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2069.6000000000004s)]
*  Points to have been an effective use of money and then they obviously have a closing argument ad [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2076.0400000000004s)]
*  That's coming at some point for the final few days [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2080.1600000000003s)]
*  So I mean you can do digital stuff with it for sure putting on actual linear TV is probably tough [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2082.92s)]
*  And you just have no points to waste right now. Yeah [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2088.1000000000004s)]
*  One other thing that came up at the town hall [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2092.6600000000003s)]
*  notable [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2095.28s)]
*  Springfield Springfield, Ohio. Let's listen my question to you very respectfully is do you really believe that? [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2096.56s)]
*  These people are eating the people's pets. Thank you. Well, thank you very much. This was just reported [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2103.56s)]

*  And eating other things too that they're not supposed to but that's been in the newspapers and reported pretty broadly [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2113.96s)]
*  No, no, it has not been reported at all. It was not I was reported by you and JD Vance [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2120.6s)]
*  and a bunch of people who don't know what the fuck they're talking about, so [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2125.6s)]
*  I [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2129.92s)]
*  Do give that guy credit for asking the question respectfully? [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2131.2799999999997s)]
*  With all due respect sir, were they eating the pets? [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2135.7999999999997s)]
*  The sad part for me as I was listening that answer was I am so online [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2140.12s)]
*  That I know exactly what Trump is talking about when he says other things [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2145.44s)]
*  The key which is the keys is the keys in the park. Yeah, I know which also not true, of course [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2148.88s)]
*  Not true. No, I don't know you think you go to a town hall a Univision tile hall and [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2154.92s)]
*  You say that you just spread a debunked conspiracy that legal immigrants are eating people's pets [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2161.48s)]
*  He's gonna what is he gonna do is even better than in the Latino vote than last time. Is that where headed? [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2170.76s)]
*  We'll find out it's just worth putting a button on the fact that [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2176.84s)]
*  This is depraved sociopathic behavior because there are innocent people and not just the [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2181.28s)]
*  Immigrants not just the migrants in Springfield. Everyone in Springfield's life everyone massively disrupted about this [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2187.76s)]
*  There are bomb threats in schools. Yep, people are scared because he has this dumb fucking lie that he can't admit [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2193.04s)]
*  Was wanting to just move on from and he did and he has done the same thing to [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2200.06s)]
*  Folks in North Carolina who are recovering from the hurricane [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2203.48s)]
*  They've had to deal with the conspiracies people in Aurora who now have to deal with the fact that they think that [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2206.3999999999996s)]
*  Other people think Venezuelan gangs have taken over the whole city [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2211.8399999999997s)]
*  Everywhere he goes. He just spreads conspiracies in order to try to win that end up hurting people [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2216.4799999999996s)]
*  He's just like fucking chaos machine just another thing another part of the argument that they should make [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2221.3199999999997s)]
*  It's gonna be a long message box. You're right [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2226.3999999999996s)]
*  I [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2228.4s)]
*  Like I'm struggling with this because I get I am a I am a data person look at the polls look at stuff and like [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2231.28s)]
*  I get that especially because she is [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2237.64s)]
*  Relatively new to the national scene as a presidential candidate this time around that [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2240.64s)]
*  She needs to define herself and people want to know what she's gonna do for them and what she's gonna do for the country [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2246.2400000000002s)]
*  And her vision and that's like incredibly important for her to talk about [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2250.7400000000002s)]
*  But at the same time she's not running against a typical Republican she's running against Donald Trump and [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2254.1s)]
*  Liz Cheney, these are all these Republicans. They're not like supporting her because they like her policies [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2261.3399999999997s)]
*  They're supporting her because they don't like her policies, but Donald Trump is fucking nuts [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2267.18s)]
*  And like if if I was gonna make an argument to someone who's going into the voting booth and wasn't sure what they're gonna [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2272.8199999999997s)]
*  Do I would probably be like, yeah, maybe you agree with some of the stuff [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2277.98s)]
*  Maybe you don't agree with other stuff [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2281.68s)]
*  but like this man is unfit to be president because he has lost his fucking marbles and [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2283.3599999999997s)]
*  That's it [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2288.48s)]
*  Yeah, I think the important part in that is and I think it fits in any version [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2290.2s)]
*  The argument you want to do but is that all the people who know him best and work for him before [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2295.44s)]
*  Exactly. He should be president again. Yeah. Yeah, don't take my word for it [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2298.6s)]
*  I'm a crazy lit right like listen to listen to General Mattis and the and the joint chiefs guy and Mike Pence [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2301.7599999999998s)]

*  All right before we get to Ben Wickler one last thing [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2313.0s)]
*  I wanted to mention JD Vance finally coughed up an answer on whether he believes the big lie [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2315.68s)]
*  He was asked yet again in an event did Donald Trump lose the 2020 election and his response is I've answered this question [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2320.8599999999997s)]
*  Directly a million times. No, I think there are serious problems in 2020 [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2327.9599999999996s)]
*  So did Donald Trump lose the election not by the words I would use [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2332.8399999999997s)]
*  I [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2337.2s)]
*  Don't know I guess that's just [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2341.68s)]
*  That that's one where I do think like going back to big lie. What do they think? [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2344.16s)]
*  I don't know how many people that moves because you've got to move the [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2348.4399999999996s)]
*  Thread of a Trump presidency forward and you can't just be looking at the past [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2351.9199999999996s)]
*  but like it goes into the whole like JD Vance is full of shit and [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2355.72s)]
*  will, you know do Donald Trump's bidding no matter what and [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2360.56s)]
*  Is you know next in line for the presidency if he wins and Donald Trump is fucking old so and and under many indictments [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2365.24s)]
*  so like right I [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2373.68s)]
*  Think people assume it's kind of the way the press coverage is there's a natural assumption. It's like well [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2375.64s)]
*  Democrats and independents know the truth all the Republicans believe it the big lie. That's actually not true [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2381.28s)]
*  yeah, in fact only a third of voters believe the big lie and [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2385.64s)]
*  Less than two-thirds of Republicans believe it and so it is a [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2390.2400000000002s)]
*  signifier [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2394.84s)]
*  That you're an extremist kook when you talk about the big lie [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2396.04s)]
*  There is this Stanford Business School study from 2022 that showed that the big lie candidates [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2398.92s)]
*  Did about did around two points worse than the non big lie Republicans in that election? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2404.64s)]
*  And so I'm not saying this is gonna cost Donald Trump and JD Vance two points [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2409.2400000000002s)]
*  But it there it does matter because it says something to voters about who you are [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2412.52s)]
*  Which then it can be projected for about all the other extreme crazy things you will do it's tied to [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2416.68s)]

*  All right, Wisconsin was decided by 20,000 votes in 2020 [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2617.4s)]
*  2022 the Senate race was decided by just under 30,000 votes [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2621.6s)]
*  So 50 50 state has been for a while [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2625.06s)]
*  Polling in the spring and summer suggested Wisconsin was the the blue wall state where Democrats had the biggest lead now [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2629.2999999999997s)]
*  It's arguably the tightest state once again as it had been in [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2635.52s)]
*  2020 [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2639.2599999999998s)]
*  What if anything do you think has changed in the race over the last month? [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2640.8199999999997s)]
*  I'm removing my cheese head because I'm nodding vigorously and it's hard to nod it and she said so replacing it with my [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2645.3399999999997s)]
*  Camo of that small hat with the little orange [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2651.9799999999996s)]
*  Wisconsin is [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2654.86s)]
*  Being itself Wisconsin is the 50 50 state [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2656.62s)]
*  so the big question is whether there's polling error and which direction it goes but [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2659.78s)]
*  The the polls getting super super tight is kind of what we experience a lot here [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2664.94s)]
*  And right now the the presidential race is a toss-up [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2669.66s)]
*  The Senate race is now a toss-up the Republicans have flooded the zone with attack ads against Tammy Baldwin [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2672.3s)]
*  So that race has gotten super tight the fight for the state assembly majority is a toss-up [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2678.42s)]
*  We are trying to flip four state Senate seats to pave a way to a Senate majority in [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2682.5s)]
*  2026 and then there's multiple House races that are in the margin of error [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2687.62s)]
*  so it is intense across the board and the question is [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2690.54s)]
*  You know were we ahead before and now it's just that partisans are kind of returning to their camps [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2694.9s)]
*  Or was there some kind of response bias that was kind of getting the polls a little bit off and now it's actually a truer [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2699.86s)]
*  Picture of what's been here all along but either way our [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2706.1s)]
*  Expectation in the final sprint is that this thing comes down to like two or three votes per precinct across the state and it's in [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2709.36s)]
*  the margin of effort as we say not the margin of error I [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2714.7000000000003s)]
*  I promise I won't harp on the polling for too long [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2718.0s)]
*  But I'm just wondering about the polling error in Wisconsin or the potential polling error [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2721.5s)]
*  It was the biggest polling error of any state in in 2020 [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2725.8s)]
*  We all remember the like the Biden plus 17 poll [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2730.6200000000003s)]
*  But even the average was was way off and it was it was more often most other states in most other cycles [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2734.88s)]
*  What's your take on whether the the best pollsters especially private campaign pollsters? [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2741.32s)]
*  have [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2747.32s)]
*  Fixed the problem or like what have they said to you about trying to fix the problem is it? [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2748.48s)]
*  What are you most worried about in terms of like? [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2752.4s)]
*  What the polls are telling you about? [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2755.1600000000003s)]
*  Where the electorate is not just in the like what's the horse race because who cares about that? [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2757.2000000000003s)]
*  But you know in terms of where the campaigns are putting time money resources, etc [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2762.24s)]
*  Yeah, well, we've been just obsessed ever really since 2016 [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2767.16s)]
*  But especially after 2020 because we had the biggest polling error in the country also [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2772.08s)]
*  2016 seven points off in the real clear politics average in 16 and 20 that was before the flood of red wave kind of skewed polling and [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2776.2s)]
*  The result of that has been a kind of flowering of a tons of different types of ways to measure [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2783.4799999999996s)]
*  What's happening with him tons of focus groups focus on particular subpopulations around the state across race and ethnicity gender [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2788.36s)]
*  geography generation it's [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2795.92s)]
*  Lots of polls at different levels conducted with different methodologies that we can kind of pile on top of each other. It's tons of [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2798.32s)]
*  Work to model who's gonna say what when we knock on their door and then compare that to what actually happens when we talk to [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2805.28s)]
*  Them so you can get a sense of whether you're off one way or the other that was part of what happened in 2016 [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2810.52s)]
*  We ignored the data from the field we don't do that anymore and all those signals are telling us that this is likely to be [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2814.72s)]
*  Super close now that said if we wake up the day after the election and we've lost by several points or won by several points [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2820.48s)]
*  In a way, I would not be shocked because there are two big forces one pushing one direction the other and the other [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2826.56s)]
*  One is that there's a lot of Trump supporters that just do not trust polling and won't answer pollster phone calls and every pollsters [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2832.56s)]
*  Has to guess how big the partisan non-response bias is and then the other thing is that the Dobbs decision [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2839.04s)]
*  Especially has energized a ton of people especially women especially young women [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2844.84s)]
*  But also older women in all parts of the state who are I think potentially gonna vote in a in a [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2849.04s)]
*  Furious and intensive way that isn't necessarily reflected in public opinion polling now if I was a pollster [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2855.64s)]
*  I'll tell you these two forces are probably gonna basically cancel each other out. We're trying to [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2861.56s)]
*  Predict both and we think we think it's tied and will be tied or that's the most likely thing and that's what the margin [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2866.04s)]
*  Of error is for us to show you, you know how far I could shift in either direction [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2871.48s)]
*  but we won't really know until the final ballots counted and the only thing we can do in the meantime is assume that that it is [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2874.76s)]
*  literally a coin flip and that if we throw everything we have against the wall if we [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2882.28s)]
*  Organize with every second of daylight and into the dark now that it's the Sun is setting so early if we make every phone call [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2886.6800000000003s)]
*  If we raise every dollar to get it into you know paid communication in every form [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2892.92s)]
*  All of that might be enough to win by a hair's breadth and save democracy [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2897.1600000000003s)]
*  I've heard you say that another challenge is [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2901.6000000000004s)]
*  In figuring this out is same-day registration in Wisconsin and so you can get a flood of people who show up on Election Day [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2906.2000000000003s)]
*  And that that were probably never captured or thought about by not only pollsters [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2913.0s)]
*  But I guess modeling is that how do you guys think of that? [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2917.36s)]
*  I mean, it's a great thing by the way that people can register same day and vote [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2919.7599999999998s)]
*  We love that but I'm sure it makes it trickier [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2923.6s)]
*  It does make it trickier because especially because nobody's pulling unregistered voters. That's just not you know, every every pollster [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2925.9199999999996s)]
*  They show you likely voters, which are a subset of registered voters and I assure you registered voters [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2932.48s)]
*  But we always have wards where there's over a hundred percent voter turnout of registered voters [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2936.6s)]
*  Because there are more people who same-day register and vote than there are people who were registered and don't vote [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2941.52s)]
*  So the electorate will grow and if you look at Wisconsin voter registration statistics [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2946.72s)]
*  it looks like the electorate shrinking until an election comes along and then and then it jumps up and [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2951.8799999999997s)]
*  That can go either way in 2020 the same-day registration favored Trump heavily Democrats voted early by mail [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2957.0s)]
*  They all registered, you know beforehand so they could get their absentee ballots this time [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2964.12s)]
*  There's a chance for Democrats to get the jump on this [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2968.3999999999996s)]
*  But there's also lots of years when it's been, you know, evenly split in same-day registration, too [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2971.08s)]
*  But that's part of what? [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2975.34s)]
*  Uncertainties built into the whole thing and it's also why the returns to effort in Wisconsin are so high [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2977.02s)]
*  Because if you're you know out at a bar talking to everyone there about the importance of voting [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2982.98s)]
*  even people who've never voted in the state before can you know wake up the next morning and [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2988.7000000000003s)]
*  Have a couple of cups of coffee and then bring it their proof of residence and their vote their photo ID and register and vote [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=2994.7400000000002s)]
*  That very day. I will also tell you I have this vivid memory from high school [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3000.86s)]
*  when a friend of mine his older sister was a UW Madison student and it was a student running for I think County Board and [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3005.62s)]
*  the friend's older sister had a party and a bunch of people stayed up really late drinking and they woke up and they're [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3014.62s)]
*  song over and like they didn't vote and the the [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3019.9399999999996s)]
*  candidate wound up losing by fewer votes than the number of people who had [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3022.8999999999996s)]
*  Been too drove to vote that day [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3027.8999999999996s)]
*  So the lesson is no matter how you feel you you will get yourself to the polls [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3029.66s)]
*  You might be the margin of victory right there [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3034.58s)]
*  So if you're gonna drink before election night, just set that alarm really loud put it right next to your head [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3037.2599999999998s)]
*  That is the one multiple alarms. Yes [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3043.16s)]
*  We're speaking on Thursday [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3048.22s)]
*  Kamala Harris has three events in Wisconsin today tour with Mark Cuban [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3050.58s)]
*  Obviously, she's gonna be in Green Bay. She's in lacrosse [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3055.58s)]
*  Also, I think Tim walls and Barack Obama are gonna be in Madison next week [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3058.1s)]
*  I've had some people ask me like in this political and media environment where everything is nationalized [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3061.86s)]
*  Everyone is polarized [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3068.7799999999997s)]
*  What is the value of campaign stops like these to you guys in terms of moving voters? [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3070.62s)]
*  They're so so helpful [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3077.7799999999997s)]
*  They've I cannot say how helpful and how valuable they are and you know time is the one thing [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3079.7799999999997s)]
*  You can't buy with with money and campaign contributions [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3084.4599999999996s)]
*  so when the candidate comes a [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3087.66s)]
*  Bunch of things happen at once the first thing is that there's a bunch of press about the fact that they're coming [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3089.58s)]
*  So it gets in the news [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3093.7799999999997s)]
*  the key thing right is reaching people who are not paying attention to politics already and when you are in the local like radio newsbreak [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3094.7799999999997s)]
*  between the best hits of the 80s 90s and 2000s that [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3101.18s)]
*  Kamala Harris is coming to town people are finding out about that [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3105.9399999999996s)]
*  Then you have the actual event your thousands of people show up [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3108.8999999999996s)]
*  They can all be asked to volunteer they can all be asked to get on the reach app [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3111.62s)]
*  They can all be asked to go to wisdoms.org and donate and sign up as volunteers to do door knocking shifts [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3115.9s)]
*  So they then can multiply out and go talk to their friends [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3121.88s)]
*  Then you have the the news coverage of the event itself, which again will reach a lot of people who are generally avoiding political news [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3124.66s)]
*  But it is the thing happening in town at that moment and in the state at that moment [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3130.94s)]
*  It's covered all over the state and then there's clips from the from the rally or the event that happened [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3134.62s)]
*  They go viral on the internet and that are used in ads so many of the ads you see in Wisconsin right now use footage [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3139.22s)]
*  From events that happened in Wisconsin [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3144.7799999999997s)]
*  So there's this like if a campaign is doing it right a visit from the candidate to a community has a multiplier effect before [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3146.8599999999997s)]
*  During and after both at the grassroots level and in a kind of air war across the state and I will tell you the Harris campaign [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3153.3399999999997s)]
*  Is using these visits in the right way? [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3159.3399999999997s)]
*  It is you know, this is not Trump rambling for an hour and a half in Madison Square Garden [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3161.4199999999996s)]
*  This is showing up in Green Bay and lacrosse and actually connecting with people energizing them and then sending them out as ground troops while also [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3166.34s)]
*  Amplifying the most critical moments [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3173.7400000000002s)]
*  So this is this is gold for us and I will say the fact that Harris and walls are visiting lots of different parts of the [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3175.26s)]
*  State different places they get you know different media markets with different local TV signals that they're coming back in different kinds of contexts and that they're [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3181.1400000000003s)]
*  You know bringing along president Barack Obama to Madison on the first day of early vote [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3188.2200000000003s)]
*  All those things could give us that final extra edge that Elon Musk with his gigantic amounts of money and his [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3192.4s)]
*  Very weird online presence. He can't match that that is something that we have and could be our counter to the flood of right-wing [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3199.4s)]
*  Money that is hitting the airways all over our state [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3206.08s)]
*  You were talking about the the the ads the deluge of ads with all the right-wing money [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3208.48s)]
*  What is the gist of these ads in terms of message and and what has been the most? [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3213.28s)]
*  The best most effective pushback to some of these negative ads [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3218.56s)]
*  So all the Republican ads in our state just about our hammering on fear and it's fear of [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3221.6400000000003s)]
*  immigrants and immigration tied to crime and [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3228.1600000000003s)]
*  Trans stuff and sometimes they tie all three of those together. Sometimes it's picked to it's like a right-wing [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3231.0s)]
*  ratbag of trying to demonize a group of people and make everyone else afraid of those folks to create an other that [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3236.52s)]
*  Strongman Trump says he'll protect you from and [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3242.76s)]
*  It's an old tired [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3245.96s)]
*  Vicious playbook but it can have an effect and it's being used at lots of levels [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3248.84s)]
*  It's being used in the Senate race as well and to counter it [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3253.44s)]
*  You have to lay out who you are and what you're for you have to point out why they're making these attacks [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3256.52s)]
*  Which is that they're trying to distract people from the fact that they're trying to rip you off and that they're trying to [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3262.02s)]
*  You know divide people because they know that if we elect Harris and walls and we elect [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3266.12s)]
*  We like to have a Baldwin [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3272.0s)]
*  We'll actually have a government that's on the side of the middle class standing up to special interests and blocking extremists from banning abortion [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3273.36s)]
*  So you you know, you have to you have to be on offense [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3279.1200000000003s)]
*  but also explain why you're under attack and then shift to the ground where you're going on offense and winning and [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3281.6000000000004s)]
*  The the thing you don't want to do is kind of get stuck in repeating their lies while you're debunking them [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3287.6800000000003s)]
*  So they're you know, they're obviously wrong, but but getting on the stronger ground [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3294.44s)]
*  And then pushing back and punching back and explaining why they're why they're doing these attacks is a critical piece of this [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3301.44s)]
*  I think one of the striking things is that the Republicans are not even trying to defend against the accusations of abortion bans [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3306.28s)]
*  They're just on the attack right now. And what that means is that a lot of Republicans [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3314.36s)]
*  Who are generally kind of partisan Republicans are coming into the fold? [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3319.04s)]
*  That's why you see the Senate race tightening [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3323.04s)]
*  Also is that there a lot of the Trump voters who were lukewarm on Eric Huffman when the ads were about Eric Huffman [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3324.44s)]
*  They're getting on board for kind of like the the mega attack [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3329.4s)]
*  game plan, but [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3333.84s)]
*  the Republicans are leaving themselves open for the kind of moderate Republicans who have mixed feelings about the fact that they're they're [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3336.1600000000003s)]
*  candidates want to ban abortion nationwide and a lot of the Democratic ads we have especially kind of [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3344.0s)]
*  on offense ads about the economy and the economic vision of Democratic candidates and [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3350.48s)]
*  About this issue of personal freedom reproductive freedom and abortion and the personal testimonials from people who've been directly affected by abortion bans or had [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3355.2000000000003s)]
*  Complications in their pregnancy and urgently needed care that Republicans are trying to ban those things those things do move voters [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3363.08s)]
*  I think they affect every race on the ballot [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3368.8s)]
*  That's one reason why we're so focused on [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3371.3s)]
*  supporting you know the down ballot candidates as well because I think that if you have an ad from a state legislative candidate that talks about [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3373.44s)]
*  The effect of the abortion man that Republicans put in or refuse to lift a finger to remove after the Dobbs decision [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3379.76s)]
*  I think that affects every race on the ballot [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3385.84s)]
*  so two kinds of [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3388.0s)]
*  Persuadable voters one kind that is open to voting for Trump open to hove D open to some Republican candidates [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3390.36s)]
*  And then there's the person who's open to not voting at all [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3398.4s)]
*  What are you guys hearing on the doors on the phones over text about? [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3403.56s)]
*  What issues are driving the race for these persuadable voters and what is getting them off the fence so it's interesting [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3408.56s)]
*  Yeah, the wall of right-wing fear mongering in the state means that if you're talking to someone who's voted Republican in the past [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3415.84s)]
*  they're often thinking about this the kind of [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3422.7999999999997s)]
*  you know criminal immigrant narrative that Republicans are pushing and you'll hear that from people and [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3425.88s)]
*  they're also thinking about what it would mean in their families if [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3431.48s)]
*  abortion was banned and they or someone that they loved needed access to abortion care and [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3435.1600000000003s)]
*  This is often. You know, it's not people who want a candidate who goes right down the middle of these two issues [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3440.8s)]
*  It's people who are conflicted across these two things [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3445.4s)]
*  I think the other piece that you often hear especially from people who generally are fed up with the system is [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3448.0s)]
*  Frustration around the economy and the feeling of like who's actually fighting for me [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3454.1600000000003s)]
*  Like I had a non-voting [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3458.16s)]
*  Uber driver who his line to me was like Republicans care about the rich Democrats care about the poor [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3460.16s)]
*  No one cares about the middle class and I was like, well [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3465.12s)]
*  I want to ask you to listen to a Kamala Harris speech my friend because you will hear [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3466.92s)]
*  Someone lay out a vision for the middle class the most in buy houses and start businesses and you know support child care support [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3470.24s)]
*  They're they're aging parents through Medicare [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3476.0s)]
*  but but it's it's going to where the voter is that actually makes the difference and [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3478.2s)]
*  The thing about the abortion bans is that they've reached into people's personal lives [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3483.72s)]
*  They've reached outside of politics outside of what's on the news and into people's most intimate [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3487.16s)]
*  Urgent medical decisions and and the moments when they're most vulnerable and something's politicians calling the shots and that's that is horrifying for people [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3491.52s)]
*  It's a horrifying thing [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3499.52s)]
*  It's horrifying prospect and it's something that a lot of people in Wisconsin are one or two degrees of separation away from someone who actually [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3500.3599999999997s)]
*  Experienced it for 451 days. We had an abortion ban here and that's that's affecting all these different races that the economic argument and [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3506.7599999999998s)]
*  This question around freedom, you know, we have [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3514.92s)]
*  Candidates Democratic candidates in every congressional district. I'm in Kristen Lierle's district right now in Green Bay [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3518.7599999999998s)]
*  She is a pro-choice OB GYN who's running for Congress and making this absolutely clear [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3523.32s)]
*  As a dividing line in this race in a way that I think energizes voters [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3528.16s)]
*  You have Rebecca cook in the third congressional district running against Eric Huvdy, Eric Huvdy [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3531.72s)]
*  By the way, he was on Capitol grounds on January 6th and would be inside the congressional chamber in in [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3536.2s)]
*  January 6 2025 if you were reelected, but that guy supported total abortion bans and [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3542.7s)]
*  Rebecca cook is a young pro-choice woman candidate who grew up on a dairy farm. She's nobody's idea [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3547.58s)]
*  You know, she's a very like kind of centrist Democratic candidate in a purple district [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3553.14s)]
*  but she's crystal clear that the government should not be overriding people's personal decisions about this and [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3557.2599999999998s)]
*  that combination of economic populism clarity about about choice and reproductive freedom and [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3562.58s)]
*  The you know the kind of common-sense rejecting extremes [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3568.8199999999997s)]
*  It's a really good fit for the district and then you have in the first Peter Barca who is up against Brian style [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3572.4599999999996s)]
*  Supported all these abortion ban bills in Congress in all these different races [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3578.2999999999997s)]
*  The arguments that the candidates are making in the house races [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3582.4599999999996s)]
*  They echo the candidates arguments for Tammy Baldwin Senate race against Pete Eric Huvdy who said he's totally opposed to abortion and they echo the [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3586.18s)]
*  Argument the Harrison Walls make against JD Vance who supported national abortion bans and Donald Trump wants to punish women [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3593.7s)]
*  And so there's a surround sound an echo effect and also with the state legislative candidates [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3598.7s)]
*  If that can be what is on voters minds as they walk into the polling place [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3604.22s)]
*  So what is on my side on the economy against special interests and somebody who's on my side for freedom against meddling extremist politicians [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3607.7799999999997s)]
*  Democrats win this election [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3614.62s)]
*  Even if it's close if people walk into the polling place feeling afraid of a phantom crime wave that's whipping through their communities [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3615.8599999999997s)]
*  You know driven by these kind of caricatured [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3623.1s)]
*  policies Republicans are telling the Democrats are imposing then it becomes really hard and that the vote the [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3626.94s)]
*  Fight for what the election is about in a way is existential as part of what volunteers can change when they're talking to people [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3631.94s)]
*  at the doors [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3637.74s)]
*  Speaking of the doors you mentioned Elon Musk. I've heard reports that [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3638.9s)]
*  Even the Trump folks who are quite confident about winning are less confident in their ground game, which has mostly been outsourced to Elon Musk [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3643.94s)]
*  I know that [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3651.5s)]
*  Democrats including folks in the Harris campaign are quite confident in the ground game [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3653.38s)]
*  I know you're confident in the ground game, but what are you seeing in Wisconsin in terms of both both sides ground game? [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3657.58s)]
*  I was in [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3662.98s)]
*  Platteville, Wisconsin yesterday [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3664.62s)]
*  in Western Wisconsin is like the southwest corner of the state and [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3666.82s)]
*  Like in every county that I visit I was asking the volunteers there if they're seeing Republican [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3670.62s)]
*  canvassers when they're out on doors and [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3677.38s)]
*  The answer is a two-letter word that begins with N and ends with oh [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3680.1800000000003s)]
*  We're out in communities all over the state in every single county all across Wisconsin every week and [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3685.38s)]
*  Every week we hear about maybe a couple of places where where America PAC canvassers are showing up and often they're not even [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3692.1400000000003s)]
*  Successfully hanging their door knockers their door knocking, you know door hangers off the doorknobs in people's houses [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3700.62s)]
*  There's been like two instances where I've heard about actual conversations people have had with them I [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3706.6600000000003s)]
*  You know, I know that this is shocking given his business record, but it might be that he's not gonna hit his deadlines [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3711.78s)]
*  Getting those door knocks done and I love this for the Republican Party. I think it's great [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3719.54s)]
*  I think it's a great example of you know outsourcing jobs that used to be done by Wisconsinites [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3723.38s)]
*  it's someone who doesn't believe in union labor and hard work and [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3729.46s)]
*  this is [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3734.7400000000002s)]
*  Their plan now does that guarantee that we're gonna win it absolutely does not it but it means that we might be able to [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3736.3399999999997s)]
*  work our way through to the finish line in this thing and [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3743.22s)]
*  Having a you know one sort of medium of the contest in which I think we have a serious advantage means that we need to [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3747.2999999999997s)]
*  Triple down on that and there's a you know [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3752.54s)]
*  in general your weaknesses are not actually your strengths and so what you want to do is make the most of your strengths and then and then [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3754.8999999999996s)]
*  Show up your weaknesses on the Republican side. They've let the bottom fall out of this thing and [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3761.02s)]
*  You know, we just need to run up the score with everything we can do to organize and get our friends out to vote [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3766.2599999999998s)]

*  Fewer votes than the number of contacts in your phone and your five best friends phones [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3790.18s)]
*  Like that could be the margin of victory in states like Wisconsin and there are not a lot of those states [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3794.46s)]
*  That is a that's a good place to leave it everyone if you're nervous [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DjJkJczbiM&t=3799.38s)]
