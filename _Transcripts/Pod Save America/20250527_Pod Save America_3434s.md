Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# The Worst Conservatives and Most Disappointing Republicans of Trump 2.0
**Pod Save America:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q)
*  Hope everyone had a good Memorial Day weekend. Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Jon Favreau. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Jon Lovett. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Dan Pfeiffer. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=4.0s)]
*  We got all four of us here today. We are doing a mailbag. We're going to take some of your [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=7.04s)]
*  questions. Happy Memorial Day. But we woke up, it's Friday, we're recording this. And we woke up and, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=11.52s)]
*  you know, Donald Trump made a bunch of news. So we might talk a little bit about that at the top, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=18.8s)]
*  if you guys want. It's not often I wake up and there's like multiple breaking news New York [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=23.36s)]
*  Times notifications on your phone about Donald Trump. Really? Do that like most days? Well, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=30.0s)]
*  this one was like a couple right in a row. Because first he threatens the EU. Right. Yeah, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=35.04s)]
*  which is one of his favorite punching bags with a 50% tariff, because apparently the trade [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=43.04s)]
*  negotiations aren't going well with Europe. So starting on June 1st, he wants to recommend [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=48.56s)]
*  a straight 50% tariff. So it'd be tough to drink those French wines, Tommy. No, Zut alors. I need [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=54.72s)]
*  a better one of those. No. And then right after that, he said, I've long ago informed Tim Cook [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=63.040000000000006s)]
*  of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=69.6s)]
*  manufactured and built in the United States, not India or anyplace else. If that's not the case, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  a tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the US. I mean, most of the weekend I'm walking [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=77.36s)]
*  around with an Apple, an iPhone on one hand and a glass of wine in the other hand. That's like both [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=86.0s)]
*  of my modern man. Wow. Look at this. Yeah. What are you doing? Just scrolling and sipping, scrolling [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=91.76s)]
*  and sipping. Yeah. Flawlessly wove those two narratives together. I was thinking about it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=97.68s)]
*  I'm like wine and it won't want an iPhone. No, I do think the tariffs are happening to you. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=102.24s)]
*  I think you're right. Also, all of our kids desperately want to work at Foxconn. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=107.12s)]
*  That's where this is going. Yeah. And then of course, Dan and I talked a little bit on [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=113.36s)]
*  Friday's episode about the threat to Harvard and trying to revoke their ability to enroll [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=118.16000000000001s)]
*  any international students whatsoever. Harvard sued. There was a temporary injunction granted [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=124.72s)]
*  this morning, Friday morning, but it's still chaos. I don't know if you guys have read some [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=131.76s)]
*  of the stories there about these students who students who are already there who don't know [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=136.16s)]
*  if they're going to be able to finish school. Students who are incoming students to Harvard, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  international students who have already like turned down other colleges and we're ready to [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=146.72s)]
*  go to Harvard and now don't know if they can. Anyway, Trump versus the world. What do you guys [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=150.4s)]
*  all think? It is very cruel to those students. Could be a good day for somebody who got waitlisted. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=155.12s)]
*  It is like 6,800 kids. It's 27% of the last year's class. I think it's international. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=162.16s)]
*  I just saw a story. I saw a Harvard professor tweeting about how among those at risk of not [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=171.2s)]
*  being able to go to Harvard this year are IDF veterans. So to combat antisemitism, we are [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=176.56s)]
*  telling Israeli combat veterans that they can't go to Harvard. That makes total sense to me. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=182.16s)]
*  Yeah. Is that what we're doing? We're combating antisemitism by kicking these foreign students, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=187.04s)]
*  including Israeli students out of Harvard? That is the sensible purpose of this. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=190.96s)]
*  It's hard to keep it straight. But it's also a DEI element to it. They're saying they also employ [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=195.68s)]
*  DEI policy. So it's antisemitism promoting pro-Hamas sympathies on campus and DEI policies. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=200.56s)]
*  Yeah. What the letter from what's her face, Christine Ohm said is that they were demanding [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  from Harvard video footage records of all the international students' potential disciplinary [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  actions. So basically, have they ever participated in a protest? That's what they're looking for. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=220.4s)]
*  Not just illegal activity, protected speech, protest activity. They're demanding any footage [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=225.6s)]
*  of protests that might involve international students. Yeah. Harvard responded. It's bracingly [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  unconstitutional. They're not pretending at all that this has anything to do with their international [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=235.6s)]
*  student program or any kind of illicit or illegal conduct by Harvard that would justify shutting [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=240.64000000000001s)]
*  down the program. They are explicitly saying, for this other reason that we care about, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=247.12s)]
*  which is antisemitic protest on campus, we are going to use all the levers of power we have at [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=252.24s)]
*  our disposal to fuck with you. So the judge blocked it because Harvard basically is saying, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  this will do a ton of harm even before we're able to litigate it. But it's also just bracingly [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=261.44s)]
*  unconstitutional. Yeah. And then the markets are taking the tariff threats well. Well, I think [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=265.04s)]
*  they're shrugging off the EU portion of it because the problem with Trump making these threats now is [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=272.64s)]
*  Europe has already watched him cave multiple times. He caved to them. He caved to China. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=278.64s)]
*  What's this, like, round two or three of these tariff threats? The new thing, waking up and [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=283.84s)]
*  threatening a foreign country or a block of them, I think I'm kind of used to right now. Waking up [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=288.96s)]
*  and threatening one of the crown jewels of the US tech community or one of the biggest US companies, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=293.91999999999996s)]
*  period, is insane. And the idea that Apple is going to shift manufacturing from China to the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=300.72s)]
*  United States is nonsensical. They're trying to shift from China to India in part because of US [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=306.96000000000004s)]
*  government pressure that we want all these major companies to diversify supply chains and not be [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=313.20000000000005s)]
*  captive to the Chinese Communist Party. Now, the Chinese are making it very difficult to shift [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=317.76000000000005s)]
*  those supply chains and manufacturing out of China through a bunch of restrictions that are [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=322.08000000000004s)]
*  too boring to get into. But the idea that Apple wouldn't just eat the 25% tariff and make our [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=327.2s)]
*  iPhones $100, $300 more expensive as opposed to trying to completely redo the company in [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=333.28s)]
*  the United States is ludicrous. Trump thinks that there's some magic factory in a box button that [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=339.84s)]
*  Tim Cook is not pushing. Even if he were to say tomorrow, yes, we're going to make more, it would [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=344.0s)]
*  be years upon years before you could start making the iPhones in the United States. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=348.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And it's basically what happened to the Mattel guy, the CEO of Mattel, because he said [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=353.68s)]
*  the same thing. He's like, oh, we're moving out of China. We're going to try to move more production [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=359.76s)]
*  and manufacturing into India. And Trump's like, no, no, no, no, no, no. You don't get to move from [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=364.71999999999997s)]
*  China to India. You have to move here. And if not, no more Mattel toys. That's what we're dealing [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=368.96s)]
*  with this Memorial Day weekend. I was actually more alarmed by the EU tariffs because what's he [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=376.96s)]
*  fucking doing? Is he actually going to go through with this? It's more of the same chaos that could [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=382.4s)]
*  have far reaching consequences. With Apple, it's like, all right, the most profitable company in [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=386.79999999999995s)]
*  the history of planet Earth. They've made an incredible amount of money making iPhones in China [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=392.15999999999997s)]
*  and selling them at tremendous profit in the US. Do I think this is the way the US president should [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=397.03999999999996s)]
*  behave? No. But do I care that much? I really don't. But I do think it speaks to how little [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=402.56s)]
*  Tim Cook has gotten for his obsequious bowing before Donald Trump. Your charm offensive and [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=408.4s)]
*  your donation, is it working? Doesn't seem like it's working. It's not working, but like the net [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=413.84s)]
*  effect of this is that Apple, Apple sells like 75 million iPhones in the US. What's most likely [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=416.96s)]
*  to happen is that they all cost $300 more. So yeah, that would really suck for like a huge chunk of [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=421.03999999999996s)]
*  the country. Well, yeah, Apple will. A huge political impact. They will make us eat the cost. Like it's. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=425.84s)]
*  I think Samsung. You can definitely drink in one. No, I know. It's just annoying. All right, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=429.76s)]
*  let's get some questions. Let's get some questions. These are from a discord from our subscribers. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=435.04s)]
*  The first one is from call me TRL. Although I think this one's probably from Elijah. What can [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=441.20000000000005s)]
*  them voters do to push the party to elect younger reps to leadership positions? Koff, AOC oversight [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=447.52000000000004s)]
*  committee, cough to move on from this seniority system they have. That was Connolly's last words. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=453.84000000000003s)]
*  Oh my God. Jesus Christ. No, no. What? What? I'm sorry. I didn't realize that. I know we died of [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=459.76s)]
*  cancer. I just, that's very specific, but I'm sorry. That was obviously inappropriate and I think we [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=468.08s)]
*  should leave it in. All right. Dan, Dan, what's your, what's your answer? It's a good joke. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=472.0s)]
*  I'm still in shock by what just happened. It begins with electing more younger Democrats, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=477.76s)]
*  right? That is the first thing that we're going to be primaries. We're going to have open seats [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=483.35999999999996s)]
*  for the Senate coming up in a whole bunch of States. We should be, if you want the younger [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=487.36s)]
*  Democrats, we should elect those and there should pressure should be put on leadership to have a [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=492.0s)]
*  different system. Like there is a value in experience for sure. Like the longer, if you've [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=498.32s)]
*  been in Congress a while, you know how these things work. You have developed issue expertise [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=504.08000000000004s)]
*  and that matters, but we have to think about other things. Politics is also performance and we have [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=507.2s)]
*  to think about people who can communicate, who can speak to the large part of our core base that [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=512.64s)]
*  we're losing, which is young voters. And so we need a system that isn't simply the, the longer [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=517.36s)]
*  you've been in Congress, you automatically get the spot. And so it's put pressure on Hakeem [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=521.76s)]
*  Jeffries, put pressure on Chuck Schumer, put, you think we need a younger leadership of the Senate, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=526.3199999999999s)]
*  put pressure on senators. You can do that by calling their office. You can do that through [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=530.64s)]
*  protests to look for, look for younger leadership. And that begins with getting someone to challenge [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=533.28s)]
*  these leaders, right? You actually need that to have particularly in the Senate. You know, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=538.16s)]
*  who's really good at finding young leaders is Matt Gaetz. You know, this, this used to be worse. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=541.6s)]
*  I think before the seventies, it was like just de facto. If you were the most senior member on [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=547.9200000000001s)]
*  the committee, you got the job. Then in the seventies, the party granted the caucus, the power [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=551.36s)]
*  to vote on these things. In 2020, Dems put in place six year term limits for chairs. So we could do [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=555.84s)]
*  more of that. There could be ranked choice voting for committee chairs. You could reform the steering [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=561.84s)]
*  committee, which is a leadership setup committee that recommends people for these spots. You [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=566.96s)]
*  could put more emphasis on policy expertise or whatever. There is an open question though, like, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=571.52s)]
*  does this really fucking matter? Like people care what AOC thinks a lot more than, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=576.64s)]
*  name a random committee chair. I can't, even though she was passed over. So it's a fair question. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=581.76s)]
*  I do agree that the committee chair issue is less of an issue than the fact that a number of house [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=586.64s)]
*  Democrats have died in office. That seems bad. Over the last year or so. Three die, three have died [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=592.48s)]
*  this year. The last eight members of Congress or senators to die while in office have all been [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=599.28s)]
*  Democrats. Yeah. But you know, ultimately, like you said, Dan, we've got to run younger candidates. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=603.52s)]
*  And if you don't see younger candidates running, run yourself. Right. You know? All right. This is [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=609.84s)]
*  from Patrick W. As someone who worked in the Senate during the first Trump term, I don't remember the [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=614.72s)]
*  moderate Dems, aside from Manchin, voting so often with Republicans for Trump nominees or for bad [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=620.32s)]
*  bills like Lake and Riley, the genius act, et cetera. What is going on with senators like [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=625.44s)]
*  Gallego, Slotkin, Warner, Rosen, that they feel like voting with Republicans and Trump so often [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=630.5600000000001s)]
*  in this moment? Anyone want to take that? So you guys want to hear some, some Republicans [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=635.6800000000001s)]
*  in the first Trump term that got big, big votes. Jim Addis, you want to guess? No, 100. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=641.44s)]
*  Unanimous. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=647.68s)]
*  Thanks for yes. Ending this way to be a team player. No, no, no, no, no. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=651.1999999999999s)]
*  It was against Jim Addis. I think it was Senator Gillibrand, I believe there was a question at the [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=657.3599999999999s)]
*  time of whether someone who was just in uniform, you're supposed to be statutorily out for five [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=663.52s)]
*  years, I think, before you can be set up. Elaine Chao got 93 to six for D.O.T. That's Mitch McConnell. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=668.16s)]
*  Pressing the flesh. I think like immigration to specific area where Democrats felt like they [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=675.04s)]
*  were offsides politically and a lot of them are these people are in border states. So they voted [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=681.52s)]
*  for terrible bills because they thought that's what their constituents want. The genius act is, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=685.52s)]
*  in my view, an indefensible, weird decision. I mean, it's about the regulation of stable coins. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=690.88s)]
*  It got 69 votes in the Senate. I think Democrats are scared of crypto money and also they want to [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=697.1999999999999s)]
*  be perceived as pro crypto among crypto fans. But Trump is literally selling access to the highest [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=702.72s)]
*  bidder as we speak or that was last night. Sorry. Yeah, I think the argument that they have made [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=707.44s)]
*  because of first the Democrats or a lot of Democrats, I think most of them, even the pro [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=712.88s)]
*  crypto Democrats in the Senate were against the genius act and then they made some changes. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=716.96s)]
*  And so the people who are for it are saying, well, it's some regulation of stable coin is [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=722.08s)]
*  better than no regulation at all. And there's all these consumer protections built in and [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=727.6s)]
*  opponents like Elizabeth Warren are saying not enough protections built in and also [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=732.48s)]
*  it's not doing anything about Trump and the Trump problem. I believe the but the regulations now [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=737.84s)]
*  say that no member of Congress or senior administration official can start a stable coin [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=743.04s)]
*  while in office. But if you already got one going. Right. Exactly. Like, come on. So not a great bill. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=747.28s)]
*  But I would take issue with the premise only in that at the beginning of Trump's term with some [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=754.48s)]
*  of the cabinet nominees and things like Lake and Riley Act, we were in a political environment [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=760.24s)]
*  where I think a lot of Democrats were like, OK, we got to work with Trump when we can and oppose [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=765.44s)]
*  him when we must. And I think now, with the exception of the genius act, I don't think many [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=770.5600000000001s)]
*  nominees are getting through the Democratic Senate. Well, except for some reason, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=775.44s)]
*  Cory Booker voted for Jared Kushner's. Yeah, that that's what I wanted to bring up. Right. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=780.24s)]
*  Which is it? I mean, he's a Charles Kushner is a longtime donor of [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=784.16s)]
*  Cory Booker, Cory Booker put out a statement right before Charles Kushner's conviction. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=788.8000000000001s)]
*  But it's an unbelievable vote. It's just absolutely an insane thing to do. Cory Booker put out some [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=793.2800000000001s)]
*  statement about how the reason he did it is because Charles Kushner helped pass the first [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=799.76s)]
*  step act. And Cory Booker was doing that in the first term, which is an absurd premise. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=803.84s)]
*  And I think it was I understand that people thought at the time that we should work with [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=807.6800000000001s)]
*  Trump when we can and oppose him when we should. That was idiocy then and is idiocy now. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=813.76s)]
*  Yeah. If they're like I can I don't know enough about the the genius act and the stable coins [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=818.24s)]
*  about and I could buy an argument that some regulation is better than none. But if you're [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=823.84s)]
*  voting no one who has to vote for a single Trump nominee has felt good about that vote afterwards. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=828.88s)]
*  Yes. How does everyone feel about their 99 votes for Marco Rubio? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=834.4s)]
*  We had been how I'm basically saying to Rubio's face this week, like I regret I regret that. But [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=837.68s)]
*  Rubio's like that's how I know I'm doing a good job. Which doesn't make any sense because were [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=842.0s)]
*  you mad he voted for you when he got the vote. You're just just just coming up with a little [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=845.84s)]
*  retort. Fucking Marco Rubio. But it did feel like what they were trying to do is the same reason [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=849.4399999999999s)]
*  they got such a big they were getting behind people like Matt. It's because this idea like [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=853.36s)]
*  no you need responsible people there to hold Trump to his feet to the fire. Make sure you know there [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=856.4s)]
*  are serious adults if he's not there who's going to be there in his place. But then that was what [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=861.12s)]
*  Marco Rubio's role. That's what Besant's supposed to be doing. Right. But they're just not. Charles [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=864.64s)]
*  Kushner. What are we doing here? Yeah. Not a great guy. All right. This is fun. Who are your [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=868.8s)]
*  rankings of most disappointing and surprisingly not disappointing Trump 2.0 appointees and [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=874.7199999999999s)]
*  characters. And then this person said Bergham is kind of wholesome. I think we just named a [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=882.0799999999999s)]
*  surprisingly disappointing one. That was just Marco Rubio. The top of my list. Right. He's throwing [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=888.0s)]
*  people in jail for writing up ads. He's helping. He's proud of it. Lead deportations to El Salvador. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=891.5999999999999s)]
*  He is he was the most normie cabinet selection out there and he's done more to erode democratic [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=897.44s)]
*  norms than maybe anyone else. Look I didn't expect good things from Kristi Noem but if you [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=903.36s)]
*  would have told me that weeks into Donald Trump being president she would do a fascist photo op [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=908.72s)]
*  in front of prisoners at a Salvadoran mega prison to justify illegal extrajudicial kidnappings that [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=912.4000000000001s)]
*  would have been surprising to me. Well it's also very specific. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=921.68s)]
*  Wow. Whoever predicted that was smart. Quite a wind up on that prediction. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=930.4s)]
*  I think Besant too. Yeah. I would say. See I don't know. Has he been a moderating force? Kind of [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=936.88s)]
*  seems like at times on the terrace. I don't think he's helped too much. Maybe. Yeah. I mean [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=942.48s)]
*  we don't know what's going on. There's a difference between a pathetic failed moderating force and [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=947.36s)]
*  someone who's going along with what like a Lutnik wants. Well said. Yeah. Tulsi Gabbard her entire [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=951.04s)]
*  worldview was defined by Iraq and now she's firing intelligence analysts who disagree with [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=956.24s)]
*  or who disagree with a political judgment they made about immigration. Dan what about you? What [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=962.24s)]
*  do you got? I probably put Marco Rubio has been most disappointing. I didn't have any real hopes [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=966.32s)]
*  for him. I just thought he would be sort of a shuffled off shuffled off to the side feckless [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=970.64s)]
*  loser the whole time as opposed to like really leaning into being a giant pro-Trump asshole. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=975.36s)]
*  That was surprising. With four jobs. Yeah. I mean I think Besant I don't know what hopes I had for [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=980.0s)]
*  him either. He's mostly failed at what he was. He's worse at being Gary Cohn than Gary Cohn [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=987.44s)]
*  which is saying a lot which is the role that he had. You know I would say Doug Burgum. I haven't [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=991.84s)]
*  really thought about him since the day he was confirmed and this question. So that seems like [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=996.48s)]
*  he's at least not doing something terrible. So I should feel good about that. Oh that's on your [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1000.4s)]
*  yeah okay. Oh that's your surprisingly not. That's my surprising yeah. I think that I did not expect [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1003.28s)]
*  much from her at all but Pam Bondi to me is like almost as bad as I imagined Matt Gaetz being. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1008.4s)]
*  Yeah. Like she and when you whenever if you catch her on TV she's just like a White House [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1015.6s)]
*  spokesperson. Yeah. Like she's the attorney general. Empty vessel. But she's just she's so [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1021.4399999999999s)]
*  obsequious in the cabinet meetings and she's just like spitting out talking points and just do she's [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1025.2s)]
*  just a Donald Trump staffer. That's it. She calls him president. Yeah. Not Mr. Not the. Thank you [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1030.08s)]
*  president. The way a child would. You know who's getting a lot of love in surprising places these [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1035.36s)]
*  days. Oh no. Cash Patel. Roll the clip. Oh wow. Oh a surprise clip. If it makes you feel better. I mean [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1041.28s)]
*  Gorka is not taken seriously by anyone who knows him. I think including his wife and he's a very [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1047.52s)]
*  nice person for Riversworth. And I think his job literally is just to sit on the internet [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1054.24s)]
*  and like send you know fiery replies to people on X. I mean I don't think he actually has a job. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1062.08s)]
*  Oh well then I guess he's the perfect guy for the job. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1067.04s)]
*  There's someone else working on counterterrorism. That was a fuck you for making me like Tucker [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1072.08s)]
*  Carlson there. I know Tucker talking to a guy named Sean Ryan who's like kind of a military [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1078.08s)]
*  podcaster guy. Oh yeah I always see him really shitting on. So is there some sort of Zab Tucker [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1083.52s)]
*  beef. There was. So apparently there was a backstory that was too long to include but [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1088.56s)]
*  Gorka went after Sean Ryan over something and was a real dick about it. They also just think he's [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1094.8s)]
*  a clown. He's like cosplaying. They're correct. Counterterrorism guy. Sean Ryan's a former Navy [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1099.68s)]
*  SEAL turned CIA kind of contractor dude. Any other pleasant surprises. Surprisingly not disappointed. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1103.84s)]
*  Anyone else. I know we kind of talked about Cash Patel a little bit. I know. I don't want to jinx [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1111.6799999999998s)]
*  anything. I don't either. You know yeah Dan Bongino and Cash Patel going out there and basically [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1116.2399999999998s)]
*  saying that Epstein killed himself. I mean it's just sort of a strange way to go fellas. But [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1122.32s)]
*  there's a kind of an odd moment of them kind of trying to speak the truth to the base. Not clear [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1127.76s)]
*  why they. I mean clearly they felt so compelled by all the pressure they're under. It tells you [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1133.6799999999998s)]
*  something about what their daily day to day priorities are. But those guys could be worse. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1136.88s)]
*  It's just weird to me like right now after the shoot the terrible shooting in DC of those two [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1141.5200000000002s)]
*  staffers at the Israeli embassy like Dan Bongino's Twitter feed is just given out like good credible [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1146.96s)]
*  information and very calm. And I'm like what it's weird to me only because Cash Patel and Dan Bongino [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1153.0400000000002s)]
*  seem less crazy than their boss. Yeah it's not like they're taking a cue from Pam Bondi. Like [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1158.8000000000002s)]
*  she's much more of like just a Trump staffer than the two of them. And I thought it would [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1163.52s)]
*  have been reversed maybe. It just raises the question about what the deep state has on both [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1168.6399999999999s)]
*  of them. Oh there we go. Exactly. Dan you joke but I listened to two hours of Tucker Carlson talking [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1172.6399999999999s)]
*  to that guy Sean Ryan last night and this was a big chunk of it. Whoa let's talk about that. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1178.48s)]
*  Where do you find the time? Two hours? I did on 2X. But it was one hour. Was it a four hour [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1183.12s)]
*  podcast you did at 2X? No two to one. Okay but you still did an hour of Tucker Carlson and Sean [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1188.96s)]
*  Ryan at night with two children. I listened to half of it this morning. It was compelling. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1194.08s)]
*  I'm gonna step in to save you Tommy. At 9 30 last night I started the conversation between [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1199.92s)]
*  JD Vance and Ross Doffit. That was an annoying conversation. And I listened to that to go to sleep. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1206.72s)]
*  What is wrong with you? It did not help me go to sleep because it got me extremely angry. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1213.44s)]
*  No fucking shit. What did you think? Ross soothing dulcet tones was gonna rock you to sleep like a [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1218.6399999999999s)]
*  Lullaby? Supposed to be a guy you're trying to get into a Twitter fight with every three days? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1225.1999999999998s)]
*  I don't know what the last straw was for Martin Luther to kick off the Reformation but it has to [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1230.0s)]
*  be a Catholic conversation more irritating than that I suppose. Anyway we won't break that down. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1235.36s)]

*  from Kev. When a Democratic president gets back in office, do you think it is their responsibility [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1423.1200000000001s)]
*  to strip back some of the presidential powers that have been taken over the past two decades? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1428.4s)]
*  Or is that not possible with an ever paralyzed and ineffective legislative branch? I had Tommy [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1432.64s)]
*  and Dan both say they wanted to take this one. Oh, my answer is nope. Use the power you have to [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1438.5600000000002s)]
*  do stuff that makes people happy. I'm not saying that President Pete should crush his enemies with [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1445.0400000000002s)]
*  DOJ, but we're not going back to normal. Let's do some shit. I thought that you were going to say [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1450.64s)]
*  for war powers. What do you mean? Like have Congress actually- [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1455.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, like the fact that we're still, the presidents are still using the authorization [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1460.88s)]
*  for FK to interact to just like launch whatever. It would be great if Congress would repeal the [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1465.7600000000002s)]
*  AUMF. I'm absolutely for that. But I think just in terms of the leaning on executive action, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1469.92s)]
*  not waiting for Congress, no, we're not going to let Republicans obstruct us to death ever again. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1477.6000000000001s)]
*  I have a different take on this. I think it's going to be a Democrats should run on an agenda [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1482.0s)]
*  that makes the president more accountable for their actions. We should support making the [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1485.3600000000001s)]
*  Hatch Act apply to the president. We should have a legal solution for where it sets out where [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1489.68s)]
*  presidents can be prosecuted to sort of hem in the immunity decision. We should pass laws that say [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1495.8400000000001s)]
*  presidents can't have meme coins, stable coins. There's like a whole set of things that we should [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1502.0800000000002s)]
*  hem that Trump has found all these loophole systems. He has exploited them mightily. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1507.92s)]
*  It is in our interest to be, we're not going to ever take advantage of those things, hopefully. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1512.8s)]
*  We should run to close all those loopholes. I think it should be a big part of our agenda. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1519.2s)]
*  I think you should do them and not do the meme coin. I think it's not going to be that hard. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1527.28s)]
*  We're in this sort of vicious circle where it's like heads we, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1532.8799999999999s)]
*  tails they win, heads we lose, which is we abide by all these structures that slow down government, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1536.56s)]
*  restrict the president's ability to operate, then Republicans come in, they can do whatever the [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1542.72s)]
*  fuck they want. We can't prove to people that government can work effectively and serve their [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1545.68s)]
*  interests if we're so hemmed in when we finally have power. But at the same time, I do think [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1550.0800000000002s)]
*  the presidency is now this sort of symbol of total government failure. The only antidote to [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1554.5600000000002s)]
*  that is not reforms that make Congress more effective or make the agencies move more quickly, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1561.8400000000001s)]
*  but just to accrue more power to the president. It's a tough spot for Democrats to be in. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1565.52s)]
*  I think Tommy is right. We first and foremost need to prove to people that government can work [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1571.44s)]
*  within the bounds of the law, within the structures provided by Congress, but that it can be dynamic [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1577.12s)]
*  and effective and fast moving. I think for a long time, Democrats weren't willing to ruffle feathers, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1582.08s)]
*  break through walls in a way that proved that to people. I think that's the first order priority. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1589.6s)]
*  I'm being a little bit glib, but I do think, and obviously I would do common sense ethics reforms, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1594.48s)]
*  but I do think Trump with Doge, for example, it was ineffective and stupid, but it made him look [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1599.68s)]
*  like he was active and doing things and actually cutting spending. I think we have to figure out [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1605.04s)]
*  our version of something like that that makes us look like we're not just going to get obstructed. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1608.5600000000002s)]
*  There needs to be a little bit of that fast moving energy with a moral and ethical and ideological [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1613.2s)]
*  goal we support. There's somewhere between the lawyers stopping everything from happening and [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1621.04s)]
*  having the judges stop everything you tried to do. Democrats have erred on the former and Trump has [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1624.56s)]
*  fallen into the latter. I would probably pass legislation or try to pass legislation to Trump [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1630.24s)]
*  proof the bureaucracy and independent agencies, just give a little more protection just based on [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1635.44s)]
*  what the courts have ruled so far. The courts have stood up to Trump on some of the deportation stuff, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1640.32s)]
*  but they are not standing up to Trump on firing, except for the Fed, I guess, firing heads of [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1645.04s)]
*  independent agencies knowing that some of these independent agencies are going to be like Consumer [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1652.8s)]
*  Financial Protection Bureau. We want to protect that beyond the next Democratic president, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1658.6399999999999s)]
*  next time there's a Republican. I would try to push for reforms there and then maybe clean up the [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1663.44s)]
*  Insurrection Act, the Alien Enemies Act, so make sure that if we get another Republican president, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1669.2s)]
*  those aren't on the table. Let me get rid of that one. You're overlooking our big win on the P-Clob. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1673.76s)]
*  What's the P-Clob? The presidency and civil liberties oversight board. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1678.72s)]
*  We won on P-Clob? The federal judge, Trump fired two Dems on that board. The federal judge said, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1683.36s)]
*  no, no, no, no. Who were the Dems, Tommy? Were they friends of yours? I don't know, man. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1687.52s)]
*  A couple of Clobs, you know? Let's do a rapid response video on our big wins on the P-Clob board. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1695.2s)]
*  I think Tommy just did. Travis LeBlanc and Edward Felton. I think that's going to go viral. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1701.12s)]
*  Oh, good. Eddie. All right. From Dan Levy, suppose you somehow had the opportunity to interview Trump. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1704.8s)]
*  How would you approach it? Would you ask tough questions and criticize his record? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1711.36s)]
*  Or would you try to butter him up and trick him into saying something harmful, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1714.8s)]
*  i.e. the quiet part out loud? All right. You know what? Honestly, we're going to have a little [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1718.3999999999999s)]
*  ceremony. We're going to bury that phrase in the ground. There's no more, how is anyone hearing [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1723.76s)]
*  any quiet parts? It's all loud all the time. Didn't have that on my bingo card. We bury that [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1728.3999999999999s)]
*  one with it. Louder for the people in the back. I would go with some simple questions. I think the [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1733.12s)]
*  Kristi Noem, what is habeas corpus example is how I would go with Trump. What does the [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1738.8s)]
*  emoluments clause say, sir? Then when he inevitably flips out, I just want one journalist to be like, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1744.0s)]
*  you're the most powerful man in the world. Your party controls the entire government. Do you ever [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1748.56s)]
*  get bored of bitching and whining so much and just see what he says? That's good. Yeah, I would go [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1752.8799999999999s)]
*  him into losing his temper, but I would also make sure that he couldn't leave the interview. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1759.04s)]
*  He could try, but the doors were all locked. I think that goading him into losing his temper, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1765.44s)]
*  especially around the jet, the corruption stuff. That's what really gets him. He really flipped [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1769.6000000000001s)]
*  out at Peter Alexander. That was great. That was really an interesting moment of him just being [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1775.0400000000002s)]
*  he had just shown his little videos and he wanted questions about the videos and Peter went right to [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1781.0400000000002s)]
*  the plane. It was like a show and tell kind of thing. Yeah, it was a presentation. Dan, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1785.76s)]
*  what would you do? I would pick one subject and stick to it. I think one of the problems with [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1792.08s)]
*  this is these reporters go in, they feel like they have to ask him about everything. Just in the [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1796.32s)]
*  example with the Terry Moran interview where Donald Trump is seeming like a complete lunatic, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1800.3999999999999s)]
*  lying or being completely misled about a picture with fake tattoos that he tweeted out of the Oval [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1806.08s)]
*  Office. Terry Moran's like, I hear you. I hear your lies, but I got to get to Ukraine. I hear [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1811.4399999999998s)]
*  the clock ticking. Just pick one issue. It could be corruption. It could be what's actually in the [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1815.6s)]
*  budget bill. It could be his illegal deportations. Let me just pick one thing and stick to it so [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1823.4399999999998s)]
*  that you can actually drill down as opposed to trying to cover the waterfront and you're all [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1828.48s)]
*  allotted 17 minutes or whatever it is. One thing I think has been effective with him too is sometimes [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1832.08s)]
*  be like, I never said that. That's not what I said. If you just have the printout of the, just have [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1837.76s)]
*  the post. He fucking hates that. He hates being confronted by his words. And if you just have like, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1841.84s)]
*  it's right here. This is what he said. It's right here. Dan is the new media section of the press [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1846.24s)]
*  room actually damaging or is it just kind of a weird sideshow? It's a weird sideshow. It's [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1851.28s)]
*  serving the purpose that Trump wants, which is to grant access to his biggest fans so that they will [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1856.3999999999999s)]
*  cover him even more positively. It's not changing the world. It's not upending what [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1863.28s)]
*  journalism is or anything like that. It's access for sycophants with large media platforms and it's [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1872.96s)]
*  working the way it's intended. Yeah. It's smart. Democrats should do the same thing. They absolutely, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1879.52s)]
*  you should. Yeah. I look forward to the next democratic president having a new media section [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1885.52s)]
*  with a whole bunch of people except us. Yeah. Four more years. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1889.2s)]
*  I was like DMing my just touch that so we could borrow their badge. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1895.52s)]
*  Fuck. We do know Brian Tyler. Yeah. I'm all done fast. Plus one. Can I please let me in? [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1901.2s)]
*  All right. Here's a tough one. Are there any conservative commentators that you respect and [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1912.72s)]
*  who is your least favorite conservative commentator so far in Trump 2.0 and then this [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1918.16s)]
*  person gives us a leading Scott Jennings? I suppose this means conservative commentators [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1922.88s)]
*  who are still pro-Trump. I think you have. Yeah. I don't think we can be like Bill Kristol. Oh, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1928.48s)]
*  yeah. Honestly, I really don't. I don't. That's not where I'm at. I really have a great deal of [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1932.8000000000002s)]
*  respect for the conservatives that said no. I think it's just been interesting. I think people [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1938.4s)]
*  revealed themselves in the last decade about what they really believed and I really genuinely [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1944.32s)]
*  admire the conservatives that walked away. But the ones that are inside defending this, [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1948.8799999999999s)]
*  I just have no respect for it. There's no, I don't know. Maybe there's some that are better [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1953.84s)]
*  than others, but it's hard for me to judge. I mean, we have Fox on all day long and it's just [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1957.4399999999998s)]
*  sort of whatever the talking points of the day are, whoever hosts is on will repeat them. In 2018, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1962.1599999999999s)]
*  the claims that there was a white genocide in South Africa and white farmers were being [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1967.84s)]
*  exterminated was cabined off to the Tucker Carlson hour of Fox News. Now that Trump is [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1972.64s)]
*  talking about it, it's on every single show. That doofus sports guy, Will Kane, everybody's [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1978.8000000000002s)]
*  just repeating that talking point. I have the least respect for those useful idiots. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1983.2800000000002s)]
*  I don't respect them, but I find it interesting that Laura Loomer, Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1988.0s)]
*  are all willing to be critical of Trump on certain issues and at certain points. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1993.2800000000002s)]
*  Again, I don't like them. I think they're bad people who do and say terrible things and [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=1997.68s)]
*  dishonest, but they speak truth to power more than like the bozos, Laura Ingram. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2002.56s)]
*  Yeah. It's interesting. It is interesting where there's a lot of people who are for whatever [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2008.96s)]
*  Trump is for because they didn't really have that strong of an ideology. They really want power and [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2014.1599999999999s)]
*  money, success, whatever it is. So they just go along with what Trump wants. And then there [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2019.28s)]
*  are the people that really did have an ideological agenda they cared about to whom they view Trump [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2022.56s)]
*  as useful. And where that pops up, you have these House Freedom Caucus members, a lot of them went [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2028.48s)]
*  along with this bill, but someone like Thomas Massey is willing to go on the floor and say, [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2035.04s)]
*  this is still a bad bill and you can't convince me otherwise. That speaks to a genuine belief [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2039.6s)]
*  that that person has. I think it's wrong, but- Then he voted for it. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2044.56s)]
*  Didn't Massey vote no. Did Thomas Massey vote no? [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2048.16s)]
*  I thought they got all- No. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2051.6s)]
*  Who's now? It was two of them, Massey and someone else. Anyway, sorry. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2052.72s)]
*  I think Massey was trying to raise money off of- [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2055.84s)]
*  Oh, that's right. That's right. Trump went after him. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2057.84s)]
*  Dan, you said that you respect Scott Jennings. That's who you're most- [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2061.28s)]
*  No, no. Yeah, I think you misheard me. I agree with Lovett. There's none of them [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2064.2400000000002s)]
*  that I respect in any way, shape or form. It is interesting. The people I respect less are the [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2068.56s)]
*  Fox News people and Bret Baier in particular. The fact that we're in a world where Laura Loomer has [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2074.08s)]
*  more journalistic integrity than Bret Baier is something that I would hope would keep Bret Baier [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2077.84s)]
*  up at night in his very, very large mansion in Palm Beach, but I suspect it doesn't. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2081.36s)]
*  Bret Baier, he really has become the lead, prob the guy at Fox News. He is the house organ. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2086.48s)]
*  It's not just that he interviews Trump. He interviews a cabinet official every other [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2091.6800000000003s)]
*  night for some sort of gauzy one-hour thing. When Trump went to the UAE in Qatar, he interviewed [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2094.96s)]
*  the prime minister and gave them both softball, hour-long, whatever, specials. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2100.6400000000003s)]
*  Do you think that the reason the Palm Beach houses of these Fox News anchors keep getting [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2106.0s)]
*  bigger is because they're like the Winchester widow and they need to sleep in a different [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2111.6000000000004s)]
*  bed each night to evade the ghosts that haunt them for what they've done and from which they've [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2115.2s)]
*  reaped their great rewards? I was thinking that. Yeah, that was my first thought this morning. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2120.64s)]
*  What's the Winchester widow? The Winchester widow, she inherited the fortune from the Winchester [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2128.24s)]
*  gun company from her husband and she built this elaborate mansion but never stopped constructing [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2133.8399999999997s)]
*  it because she would like to sleep in a different room because she felt she was haunted by the ghosts [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2138.08s)]
*  of the people killed by the weapons. It's this maze-like structure. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2141.44s)]
*  What's the origin of the story? The Winchester widow. That's it. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2146.56s)]
*  What do you mean? Did someone write it? [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2151.04s)]
*  Oh, I don't know. You mean where did I hear from it? I don't know. I don't know what fucking rattles [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2154.48s)]
*  around. I read a book or I saw TikTok. The content people come here for. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2161.84s)]
*  I'm Googling it for you. Maybe it's just because I listened to the interview last night. I thought [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2169.28s)]
*  Ross Deffett did a good job with JD Vance. Did he? The daily part he didn't push back. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2176.0s)]
*  This is the problem, Tommy. First of all, it's a good lesson. Doing the interview about the [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2181.44s)]
*  interview you just did. Lame. Yeah. We've thought a couple times about like, should we talk about the [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2187.92s)]
*  interview after listening to five minutes of the daily doing that? I was like, absolutely not. Why [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2192.0s)]
*  am I listening to this? I should listen to the actual interview between Ross and JD Vance and [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2195.36s)]
*  Ross is famously against masturbation too. Did that come up in the interview, John? [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2199.12s)]
*  Can't agree with him on everything. You're going to jerk yourself off on the daily. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2204.9599999999996s)]
*  He pushed JD Vance on immigration and some other like, oh, so you're a Catholic Christian and [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2215.04s)]
*  you believe this. JD Vance was fucking smug and awful. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2220.7999999999997s)]
*  I want to modulate my joke earlier, which was really just about JD Vance being irritating. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2225.92s)]
*  I actually want to listen to the conversation. I think there's a lot of knee-jerk, Ross Douthat [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2231.12s)]
*  hate in the world that I'm not a participant in. I like him. He's a conservative that's interesting [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2236.08s)]
*  because I don't think he's anti-Trump, but I don't think he's pro-Trump either. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2242.0s)]
*  I think he's interesting. I actually don't put him in that category at all. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2246.4s)]
*  Scott Jennings is definitely my least favorite or maybe tied with Bacha Ungar Sargon. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2250.4s)]
*  Oh yeah. She's sort of a new character. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2256.2400000000002s)]
*  They're all coming off that Abby Phillips evening panel. Poor Abby. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2259.6s)]
*  Stop booking him. She's doing a good job trying to deal with it. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2264.08s)]
*  What's your take on Blue Sky? Can it be good or will it discourse itself to death? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2268.56s)]
*  This seems so far up your alley, John. Let us know. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2272.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh boy. Are you on there? [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2274.96s)]
*  I check in once a week, once a couple of times a week just to see what's going on. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2276.7200000000003s)]
*  Like a wellness check? [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2280.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're like a PO. What are you talking about? [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2280.88s)]
*  Otherwise his ankle starts beeping. He's got to blow into the tube and make sure [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2285.12s)]
*  and otherwise it gets in trouble. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2290.16s)]
*  Well, here's the thing guys. Some of the people that we like and follow a lot on Twitter are now [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2292.08s)]
*  mostly posting on Blue Sky. Chris Hayes, Rachel Maddow, they're mostly there. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2298.08s)]
*  So I want to see what's going on. Then every time I go, in my mentions, there's a lot of people [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2303.2s)]
*  being like, you guys got to come over to Blue Sky. Tell John and Tommy to come over and Dan [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2307.2s)]
*  and what's going on. So I go over and I'm like, I'm always trying it out. I went yesterday and [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2312.16s)]
*  people are very mad. Love it that you and I are hosting a Jake Tapper Alex Thompson book event. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2318.16s)]
*  Little do they know that Jake might actually come on the pod. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2328.16s)]
*  But so I tweeted something or skated something about it and then my mentions flooded with just [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2331.4399999999996s)]
*  someone told me to throw myself down a mineshaft. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2340.3199999999997s)]
*  Well that's like Twitter energy. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2343.52s)]
*  But it is Twitter. Yeah, totally Twitter energy. Then they're like, go back to the Nazi site. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2344.8799999999997s)]
*  There's a lot of nice people that are like, here's what you need to do. Then someone told [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2349.68s)]
*  me that there is a way to filter out all the mentions from people that you don't follow on [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2353.2799999999997s)]
*  there, which you can do on Twitter and it improved my Twitter experience. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2357.2s)]
*  They didn't have it at first in Blue Sky, but now I did that and I think, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2360.88s)]
*  man, maybe I'll give it another whirl. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2363.68s)]
*  Sarah Longwell was talking with, they did, I was listening to Sarah and Tim and JBL talking on the [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2366.24s)]
*  bulwark and she was saying how she's been trying to avoid consuming, trying to like not consume [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2371.36s)]
*  as much opinion and more straight facts so that she can know that she's forming her own opinions. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2376.96s)]
*  And I've just been, I've been feeling just like, I don't know, just the [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2381.92s)]
*  relentlessness of Trump, the kind of onslaught of it. Like I've been feeling my inability to [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2384.8s)]
*  focus getting worse in the last couple of weeks. And so I took Twitter off my phone again, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2388.8s)]
*  because I am trying to just like, let me just read the stories and show up. And you know what, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2393.2000000000003s)]
*  if I'm like, you know, it's like, I just, I don't want to like run my opinions through the machine [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2397.36s)]
*  as much as I've been doing. So I've like took it off my phone for a while. See how that goes. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2401.44s)]
*  Okay. And Tommy, you're not skeetting any time soon. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2405.44s)]
*  Never signed up for it. Everything I hear about it makes me feel like that was the right decision. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2407.76s)]
*  Can I defend Blue Sky for a second? [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2411.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2412.8s)]
*  I just like, like I would love it. I'll turn it to Twitter, but I just don't want to deal with [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2413.36s)]
*  lib on leftist violence all day long. It sounds like that's what it is. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2416.56s)]
*  Here's where Blue Sky I think can be most useful is all of our Twitter feeds, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2421.2000000000003s)]
*  everyone we followed over the 10 or so years we've been on Twitter is such a disaster now [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2427.36s)]
*  that you can kind of start fresh in Blue Sky. I don't post there very often, but I do look at it [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2432.0s)]
*  and I basically just only follow reporters. And it is actually a much better way when something [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2436.56s)]
*  happens to just go to your following tab on Blue Sky, which is just all reporters that I followed [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2442.24s)]
*  in the last couple of years here. And you just get people telling you what's happening in the news. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2447.3599999999997s)]
*  It is, that is the closest thing to the Twitter 2011, 2012 experience of it as a, in real time [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2452.3199999999997s)]
*  news site. This is a general rule, whether it is Twitter, Blue Sky, don't read your mentions, John. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2460.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2467.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. I see your mentions sometimes because I see your tweets and they're not, they're not, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2468.0s)]
*  tell you, you're not getting a better experience on X. I'll tell you that right now. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2472.72s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. That's why oddly enough, my experience on X has been better for the last [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2475.12s)]
*  several months than Blue Sky because you have your blinders on. I hid the mentions on X. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2479.76s)]
*  Yes. You need your Blue Sky blinders too. For sure. For sure. But I also, to that point [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2482.96s)]
*  about the news and Sarah's point, I made a list on Twitter that's called Just News and it's just [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2487.44s)]
*  following reporters because I have the same thing. It's like sometimes you just want the latest news [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2492.64s)]
*  and you don't want people's opinions. Do you have a, do you have a feed on your, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2496.32s)]
*  whatever they call it, Tweet Tech Now site that's just like people you want to fight with? [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2500.7200000000003s)]
*  It's like Stephen Miller, JD Vance, Mark Davis. No, I don't have that. Then please don't give me [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2504.7200000000003s)]

*  him yet. There was a couple of days ago, I was trying to write a description of something [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2696.3999999999996s)]
*  and it was a tough thing to hit the tone right. I was just struggling. I just said, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2701.9199999999996s)]
*  like, hey, help me come up with a sentence or two to help describe this. It's for an upcoming [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2705.2s)]
*  series we're going to do. I didn't use basically any of it, but it gave me one sentence that was [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2710.88s)]
*  smarter than what I had come up with myself, to be honest. I was like, oh, that works. Let me take [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2715.92s)]
*  that and then I can write something to it to figure it out. I think it's a block obliterator. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2719.28s)]
*  It'll just throw... It's relentless. You can just get a bunch of ideas and maybe you grab one and [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2726.08s)]
*  then you can keep working, keep writing, think of something. Other than that, I haven't yet [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2730.88s)]
*  really cracked why it's... I don't know. Maybe it's helping people move faster, but... [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2735.28s)]
*  I use it all day, every day. Really? What's your preferred? [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2739.12s)]
*  I use it as... For Google, I never Google anything anymore. I will ask it very specific questions [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2743.12s)]
*  to find answers to. I will use it to synthesize data. I will upload a large poll and ask it for [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2751.12s)]
*  a set of findings to answer certain questions or test the premise. I will use it... I never use it [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2758.88s)]
*  for writing per se, but I will use it the same way you do love it, which is like, I am stuck. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2765.04s)]
*  I'm trying to write something and it's like, you've used the same descriptive word three times and [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2769.12s)]
*  you're trying to... What's another way to say this? I use that. I will upload a full message box and [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2773.36s)]
*  I will ask for 10 title suggestions and almost never do I end up using the ones they actually [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2779.7599999999998s)]
*  have, but it always helps me figure it out. I use it for a lot of research [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2786.4s)]
*  and to really synthesize large data sets into easily understandable things. You can use it to [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2794.0s)]
*  make... I'm not very good at this, but to use it to make charts and graphics. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2799.68s)]
*  The part that I find troubling about it still is like... You let's say ask it a question about the [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2804.16s)]
*  news and most of the time it's giving you a useful synthesis of various articles and that's great, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2809.92s)]
*  but it's trained on certain data sets and one of them is that Joe Biden... A lot of what it was [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2815.2s)]
*  trained on was a time when Joe Biden was president and so you'll ask it a question and you're like, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2820.0s)]
*  wait a second, this answer still thinks Joe Biden is president and so like, oh wow, it's really... [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2823.84s)]
*  If you were working with someone day to day... It was Mike Donilon. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2829.44s)]
*  Yeah, it was Mike Donilon. It was... Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm using a Mike Donilon 4.7. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2831.76s)]
*  If you were working with somebody and they were really, really smart, but every once in a while [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2840.64s)]
*  thought it was 1997, you'd be like, oh, I can't trust you. So that makes me nervous about it. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2843.76s)]
*  I make it double check it's work. I make it double check it's work all the time. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2849.52s)]
*  Yeah, I'd be like, are you sure this is correct? [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2852.16s)]
*  It's so obnoxious. It's going to hate me. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2855.04s)]
*  Hey, I'm about to say this on a podcast. Are you sure? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2856.8s)]
*  I saw something that really kind of like was... I tried it and it was interesting. Again, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2860.24s)]
*  this is just like just coming up with questions to ask to kind of learn about it, but it said, [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2864.8s)]
*  you don't just ask it a question, you say, assemble a group of experts to help me answer this question. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2868.4s)]
*  Assemble a marketing person, a political person, a strategist, an expert on YouTube, [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2873.6s)]
*  have them meet and discuss this question and decide on an answer together and then show me [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2878.8s)]
*  what they did. And they have a meeting and then you reply and you say... [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2883.28s)]
*  Do you give them a lunch break? [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2886.7200000000003s)]
*  You reply and you say, all right, this is a great first draft, but remember this whole team gets [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2888.32s)]
*  fired if it's not perfect. And they're like, all right, back to the drawing board, everybody. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2892.32s)]
*  Here we go. We got to really pull off a great meeting. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2895.76s)]
*  Wow. You're really, you're into it. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2898.4s)]
*  I'm learning. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2900.0s)]
*  That's taskmaster. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2900.48s)]
*  I also use it for recipes all the time. Like I want to make this because it's very... [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2901.2000000000003s)]
*  What it allows you to do is like, well, I don't have this and then I'll give you a new version [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2905.92s)]
*  with this thing you do have. I've read you can do this, I've never done it. You can take a picture [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2909.7599999999998s)]
*  of your fridge, upload the Chetch EBT and it'll offer things based on what's in your fridge, [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2914.08s)]
*  what you can cook. I've never done it, but I've read that that's something you can do. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2918.16s)]
*  Cool. Creepy though. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2922.24s)]
*  All right. Next question. Tommy and John, any comments on the Celtics demise? Dan, [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2924.4s)]
*  any comments on the 76ers, whatever is going on with them? I only caught, let's see, [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2929.12s)]
*  the first game where we blew a 20 point lead and then I tuned in right before Jason Tatum got hurt. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2934.7999999999997s)]
*  That's all I had for the Celtics. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2941.52s)]
*  Yeah. So our best player is out for at least a year. I mean, it's an Achilles. So like, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2943.12s)]
*  you wouldn't bring him back at this point. Our two best players both got super max contracts. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2947.8399999999997s)]
*  Dan, do you understand the NBA salary cap? I don't. There's something called the second apron. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2954.08s)]
*  We're apparently above that and there's a bunch of restrictions. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2958.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2961.68s)]
*  The work to unravel the team is basically the same. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2961.76s)]
*  You have to get below the second apron because if you're on the second apron two years in a row, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2963.44s)]
*  in addition to having a giant half billion dollar tax payment, you also have real restrictions about [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2966.0800000000004s)]
*  what players you can sign, how you can use your various cap slots. And so they have to get below [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2972.88s)]
*  it because they have to trade some of the members on the team, most likely True Holiday or Christoph [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2977.44s)]
*  Sporzingis. Who's at the, yeah, he's at the, he also had a weird health thing. So we're fucked. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2982.32s)]
*  We're at the end of this little run. I'm going to tell you, I don't think [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2985.6000000000004s)]
*  draft Kings or Fandl, whoever like me make this bet right now, but I would put a hundred dollars [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2991.92s)]
*  down right now that the Celtics will win the 2026 NBA draft lottery. Oh, because you think it's [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=2996.5600000000004s)]
*  rigged? Yeah, for sure. Okay. Yeah. Like Dallas. Maybe it's rigged by God. That's possible. It's [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3002.2400000000002s)]
*  not, but every time that something like this happens, this is how the Spurs got Tim Duncan. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3009.1200000000003s)]
*  It's how the Mavs got Cooper flag. It's how miraculously the six weeks after Anthony Davis [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3014.2400000000002s)]
*  left New Orleans, they got Zion Williamson. So this would be, this is a bet I would be willing [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3020.08s)]
*  to make. It's interesting because it would make sense to me that the same God rigging a draft for [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3024.7999999999997s)]
*  the Celtics would be the one that made Donald Trump president. It's a good point. It's a solid [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3029.44s)]
*  point. Tough but fair. Sorry, Boston. From Katzian, Katzian, Katz anyway. Katzian, Katz, [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3036.0s)]
*  Katz and Katz. Is there anyone in the cricket office who beats fabs for screen time? Is there [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3045.84s)]
*  a dark horse we're unaware of? Probably. I got Saul. It's Elijah, right? It's Elijah. It's Austin. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3050.48s)]
*  I believe it is two of the other hosts of this podcast. The only one who gets off here is love [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3058.48s)]
*  it. Yeah, that's right. Thank you. I got here in all kinds of places. I'm guessing Dan because I am [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3064.32s)]
*  on text chains with Dan so often that I know he must be looking at screens and Tommy is just [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3072.72s)]
*  just as bad as me. I just described about his Tucker Carlson interview in the evening. It was [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3078.64s)]
*  dark research. Deep research. Yeah. But do you want to defend yourself, Dan? Are you trying to? [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3084.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm online way too much. There's no question about that. The difference is you're just now become such [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3091.4399999999996s)]
*  a poster. Yeah. It's like we always know when you're online, you're always posting. Always be [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3095.2799999999997s)]
*  posting. Always be posting. This is from love it always cracks me up. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3100.24s)]
*  What a surprise that love it shows this question. I like the question. I like the question. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3108.7999999999997s)]
*  What are your favorite RPGs of all time? Thank you. Love it cracks me up. All right. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3112.72s)]
*  Here's my list. This is the only notes I took for this whole [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3117.4399999999996s)]
*  solo court. You hung back for the rest. Yeah. Bloodborne. Bloodborne. I did demon souls, [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3121.04s)]
*  Dark Souls three Elden ring. Those are all part of the kind of from software universe. I love [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3129.04s)]
*  Skyrim. I love fallout. Some of those games dishonored is not technically an RPG. I think [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3133.68s)]
*  it's RPG adjacent, but I really like the world building. Deus Ex human revolution was a great [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3138.08s)]
*  game. Diablo three Diablo four are on the list, but I do think those games are basically a kind [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3142.8s)]
*  of drug and are dangerous. They're dangerous. They grab you. They don't let you go. They're [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3147.36s)]
*  kind of they hook you with the serotonin loop. Not an RPG, but Subnautica is a great game. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3152.24s)]
*  That's about building up your abilities. It has some like RPG vibes, even though it's obviously [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3159.04s)]
*  not an RPG. And then I am very excited to play Baldur's Gate three and just go Elysium. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3162.96s)]
*  I used to like RPGs when I was a Nintendo kid. And then I liked your final, your final fantasies, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3168.0s)]
*  your Chrono triggers, old school. Yeah, that's that was when I stopped and I stopped in college. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3173.52s)]
*  I played, I played Skyrim and fallout in an earlier period of my life. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3179.52s)]
*  That's great, Dan. I like those games. I really got into Skyrim. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3183.84s)]
*  Last question. Based on the internet debate of could 100 men kill a gorilla without weapons? [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3188.4s)]
*  Crooked has about 100 employees. Could the crooked staff kill a gorilla? [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3194.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, not in a million years. Here's the thing. Here's the thing. I look, I, I love our here's [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3199.2000000000003s)]
*  the thing crooked. I this what I'm about to say is going to just you don't have to bear with what [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3209.12s)]
*  I'm going to say. This is the one you didn't prepare for. I love how many different parts [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3215.44s)]
*  of the pride flag are represented at this company. But I do think it puts us at a [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3219.76s)]
*  disadvantage against the gorilla. I'm sorry. You know that, you know, that I just think that like, [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3225.2000000000003s)]
*  we got to put a lot of our he hems at the front and some of our, and a lot of just got to get those [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3232.2400000000002s)]
*  he hems up ahead. Sorry, we're sending in the he hems and the, and the she hers and the they thems, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3238.88s)]
*  we're going to hang back. And then, you know what? I wouldn't put too much stock in the he hims. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3243.44s)]
*  My actual view on the defeating of the gorilla is it's actually not about whether the gorilla loses [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3251.68s)]
*  the gorilla will lose. It's about whether you are one of the first five to 10 humans to go into that [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3256.64s)]
*  fight. Cause a couple of people are going down and they're going down hard. A gorilla can lift [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3262.48s)]
*  like 2000 pounds. Gorillas are strong, but a hundred of us, we're going to beat the gorilla, [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3267.12s)]
*  but we're just going to take some pretty heavy losses early on. That's the promise. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3271.84s)]
*  That's what's going to happen. I'm sorry to say arms are going to be ripped off faces torn apart. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3275.2000000000003s)]
*  It's going to be a ugly battle, but we're going to tire that gorilla out. All right. We're going to [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3279.6000000000004s)]
*  be able to coordinate using what language? If I had a hundred Aaron Donalds in the first 50, [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3284.2400000000002s)]
*  we're ready to die. Maybe. But like you think you would need a hundred Aaron Donalds to beat one [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3290.2400000000002s)]
*  gorilla. I think you have to send waves of 10 to gang up on it. Uh, and try to, why wouldn't you [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3295.2000000000003s)]
*  send all 100 at a time? Because you can't, there's not that much surface area. Yeah. Uh, well, [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3299.68s)]
*  yeah, I think, I think you definitely need at least 10 to move in at once, but I just think [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3304.72s)]
*  then the grill is going down. It's lucky that we're sending first to the gorilla. What we're [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3308.64s)]
*  sending girls. Yeah. Girls get some, I think Ben Hefko could fuck up. Yeah. Well, he doesn't [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3312.56s)]
*  impression. Is he here? Who's not here? I got a follow up from love it actually. Uh, no, sorry, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3318.7999999999997s)]
*  this is from the love of the show on earth. What if it was 100, uh, gorilla sized ducks? [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3326.8s)]
*  Uh, a hundred gorilla sized ducks. Well, I think it's a hundred. Oh my God. That's a big, [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3332.4s)]
*  that's a lot of them too. Yeah. We're fucked. And that's, yeah, it's hard. I think you, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3338.0800000000004s)]
*  I think you could beat the ducks. I don't think you could beat a hundred duck sized gorillas though. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3343.6800000000003s)]
*  Hundred. Oh, interesting. It's like, it's like ant man. So would they have, yeah, [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3348.7200000000003s)]
*  is it one person versus a hundred gorilla ducks? Or is it the whole, is it each staff get a duck [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3353.3599999999997s)]
*  sized gorilla? That's actually the Christmas present. It's the holiday present. Yeah. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3358.3199999999997s)]
*  I'll tell you either way, we're going to hear about it from the union. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3365.04s)]
*  It's going to be a tough one. It's not in the job description. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3369.2799999999997s)]
*  The CBA specifies. Yeah. Hey guys. They are not supposed to go first. Yeah. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3375.68s)]
*  There's no animal combat. Yeah. Senior staff. I noticed no one from senior staff was in the [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3380.16s)]
*  first wave going at the gorilla. A lot of, no senior producers going in first. All right. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8ewTCye-Q&t=3384.72s)]
