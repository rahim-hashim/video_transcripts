Video Description: President Biden pardons his son Hunter—a move he'd once promised not to make—and the backlash is immediate. Republicans are calling it a political favor, while some Democrats argue it undermines trust in the justice system. Meanwhile, Trump promises to replace FBI Director Christopher Wray with Kash Patel, a loyalist known for wanting to prosecute Trump's enemies (including journalists), even as his pick for Defense Secretary, Pete Hegseth, faces new allegations of workplace misconduct—and a scathing email from his own mother. Plus, Bernie Sanders finds surprising common ground with Elon Musk, and Cheryl Hines posts a Black Friday thirst trap.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Joe Biden's Sweeping Pardon for Hunter Biden Sparks Outrage
**Pod Save America:** [December 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A)
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Jon Favreau. I'm Jon Lovett. Tommy Vitor. On today's show, Donald Trump says he's gonna replace FBI director Chris [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=0.0s)]
*  Wray with Cash Patel, who said he wants to prosecute journalists and Trump critics. Fun. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=6.76s)]
*  Defense Secretary nominee Pete Hegseth faces newly reported allegations about what a shitty person he is, including from his mom. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=12.44s)]
*  And Bernie Sanders finally finds common cause with the billionaire. Even crazier, it's Elon Musk. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=20.84s)]
*  Here's the question I had after reading the news today is whose Thanksgiving was worse, Biden's or Hegseth's? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=27.52s)]
*  Joe Biden being buttonholed about pardoning his son or Pete Hegseth dealing with his mother's letter in the New York Times. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=32.48s)]
*  Well, the letter's from like 2018. I know but it sort of came up this week. And the pardon was after Thanksgiving. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=38.6s)]
*  Well, yeah, of course it was. You spent a weekend being fucking hammered by your whole family for a pardon. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=43.32s)]
*  You'd do it Sunday night, too. Just get off my goddamn back. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  Anyway, so Bernie found common cause with billionaire Elon Musk. We'll talk about that. We'll get into all the dos and doges of [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=50.96s)]
*  collaborating with oligarchs to cut defense spending. I want you guys to know that Reed told me he wrote that line as a personal challenge to my dignity. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  Oh, really? And uh, I guess I'll just say go ahead and say go ahead and say it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=65.32s)]
*  Which I accepted. All right, it's for you, Reed. But first, I hope everyone had a lovely Thanksgiving. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=69.32s)]
*  Why are you laughing? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=77.47999999999999s)]
*  It's funny the news. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump commemorated the holiday by sending wishes to all of us radical left lunatics who worked so hard to destroy this country. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  Looks like we failed. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=88.04s)]
*  He also posted an homage to National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=89.64s)]
*  which we had mentioned is one of our favorite Christmas movies, certainly mine, where he pops out of a deep fake Joe Biden's turkey and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  dances to YMCA. I think it's some of his best work. It was very funny. I don't think he makes them. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=101.4s)]
*  I think they steal them from the internet. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=106.72s)]
*  No, you don't think so. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=107.72s)]
*  I don't think his campaign makes them either. I think you just rip them off of Reddit. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=109.72s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's probably right. I found Trump's staff announcements less compelling. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=111.72s)]
*  He said he'll appoint the fathers of two of his son-in-laws to big positions. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=116.92s)]
*  Massad Boulos, the Lebanese-born father of Tiffany Trump's husband Michael, will be senior advisor to the president on Arab and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=121.36s)]
*  Middle Eastern affairs. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=129.4s)]
*  He got a lot of expertise there, Donald. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=131.07999999999998s)]
*  Um, not that I can tell. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  I think he did run for parliament in Lebanon. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=134.36s)]
*  Yeah, he lost. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  And Charles Kushner, the former real estate developer and convicted felon whose Jared's father will be ambassador to France. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=138.16000000000003s)]
*  Sweet gig. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=145.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, a reminder that Charles Kushner is the guy who [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=146.48000000000002s)]
*  retaliated against his own sister for cooperating with federal investigators looking into his business practices by soliciting a [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=150.4s)]
*  prostitute to sleep with her husband, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=157.84s)]
*  filming it, and mailing her the tape. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=160.24s)]
*  Honestly, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=162.68s)]
*  yes, terrible, but also, I don't know, something you can kind of see Benjamin Franklin doing. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=164.4s)]
*  Some straight-up game. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=169.44s)]
*  Creative. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=170.72s)]
*  If he had the technology. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=171.22s)]
*  I think they didn't want the brother-in-law to testify in the financial fraud case against him, too. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=171.72s)]
*  So there's a lot of depth to this. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=176.0s)]
*  Trump pardoned him in 2020, and now he, if confirmed, is off to France. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=178.0s)]
*  Not to be outdone in the special favors for family members category, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden made the biggest nepotism news of the weekend when he announced a pardon for his son Hunter. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=187.8s)]
*  Something he repeatedly said during the campaign he would not do. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=193.88s)]
*  Earlier this year, Hunter pled guilty to federal tax charges in Los Angeles and was found guilty in a federal court in Delaware [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=198.44s)]
*  for lying about his drug addiction on his application to buy a gun. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=204.84s)]
*  The president released a long statement saying he'd come to the conclusion that Hunter's prosecution had been political the whole time and [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=208.72s)]
*  that, quote, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=215.56s)]
*  There has been an effort to break Hunter, who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=216.76s)]
*  unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution, in trying to break Hunter, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=222.48s)]
*  they've tried to break me. And there's no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=226.76s)]
*  I hope Americans will understand why a father and a president would come to this decision. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=231.48s)]
*  All right, I got two Americans right here. Do you guys understand? What do you think? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=237.2s)]
*  On a human level, obviously I get it. It's not just a father pardoning his son. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=241.84s)]
*  It's a dad who lost a baby girl as an infant. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=245.64s)]
*  Bo Biden passed away recently. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=249.23999999999998s)]
*  It's also probably true on the merits that that Hunter got harsher treatment because of his last name. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=252.04s)]
*  But it's also the fact that President Biden lied and repeatedly lied and that he wouldn't pardon Hunter or commute a sentence. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=257.03999999999996s)]
*  He had his press secretary lie on his behalf. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=265.32s)]
*  Biden's supporters held up Joe Biden's refusal to pardon Hunter as an example of his commitment to the rule of law, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=267.64s)]
*  in contrast with Trump. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=274.68s)]
*  But NBC News reported that when they decided to put this out there and say that that Biden wasn't going to pardon his son, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=276.8s)]
*  actually, Biden and his top aides knew that it was still an open question. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=283.96s)]
*  And so now everyone looks stupid. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=287.88s)]
*  Everyone looks like they're full of shit. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=291.56s)]
*  And Republicans are going to use this to argue that it was politics as usual when Democrats warned about Trump's corruption or threat to the rule of law or the threat to democracy. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=292.76s)]
*  And I think that's the piece of this I am most frustrated with, which is Joe Biden looking like a typical lying politician. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=304.04s)]
*  And I think that leads to a cynical feeling that all politicians are bad and they're all the same and that this is just par for the course. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=311.36s)]
*  And so I'm not really worried that this is going to make it easier for Trump to be corrupt or to ignore the rule of law himself. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=319.68s)]
*  He was already going to do it. He'd already named Matt Gaetz to lead the Department of Justice. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=326.0s)]
*  He campaigned on it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=330.32s)]
*  He'd already named Cash Patel. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=331.20000000000005s)]
*  It's all right. He's already named Tiffany's husband to be this Middle East peace envoy. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=333.20000000000005s)]
*  Already hinted at using the pardon power for January 6. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=337.72s)]
*  Yeah. But you know, more of a hint. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=340.04s)]
*  Yeah. More than a hint. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=341.76000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. Right. Right. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=342.8s)]
*  Campaign promise. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=344.48s)]
*  Yeah. But also, I mean, Hunter's pardon is expansive here. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=345.56s)]
*  It covers goes back a decade. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=348.0s)]
*  So the right wingers, I listened to Ben Shapiro this morning, like they're all saying what this shows is that Joe Biden was in on the take the whole time that he was getting money from Hunter's business dealings because he [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=349.64000000000004s)]
*  pardoned this decade's worth of time. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=360.92s)]
*  And now I think Joe Biden damaged his own reputation in service of doing something understandable on a human level for his son. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=363.32s)]
*  And he also part, you know, damaged the Democratic Party's reputation. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=370.8s)]
*  And the question I have is, is Hunter the only one getting saved here? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=374.6s)]
*  What about like Dr. Fauci? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=377.84000000000003s)]
*  What about Liz Cheney, who's getting told that she should be tried for treason? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=379.28000000000003s)]
*  Can I make a point about that? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=384.28000000000003s)]
*  Because this is this is the main thing that I've been thinking of. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=385.44s)]
*  And I've been thinking about it even before the Hunter pardon was announced. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=388.28s)]
*  If Joe Biden had come out, we throw over the weekend or in several weeks, or maybe he'll do this before he leaves and says, look, I take it seriously that Donald Trump campaigned on prosecuting people he doesn't agree with and throwing them in jail and cash [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=393.52s)]
*  Patel and Matt Gaetz and all these people show that he's going to carry through. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=408.79999999999995s)]
*  And so I am issuing a full blanket pardon for all of these people who have been targets and who have been on Trump's enemies list. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=411.76s)]
*  Like, I first of all, I think if he does do that, it makes the Hunter pardon seem more acceptable to me. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=418.76s)]
*  And if he doesn't do that, then I think it's even more infuriating that he saved his son and not a whole bunch of other people who were just government servants doing their job. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=426.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=433.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's my that's my because we joked about it in the past. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=434.56s)]
*  And whether or not Biden actually in his mind believed he was going to try to not do this or on some level, he always knew he would do it. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=437.84s)]
*  I don't know. But I thought he was going to do this. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=444.56s)]
*  I like I felt like this was coming. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=446.72s)]
*  I don't know. Yeah, well, I feel like a fucking fool. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=449.84s)]
*  You know, that's what makes me mad about it. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=453.4s)]
*  Well, like, there's sort of to me, I was just thinking about this specific pardon. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=455.04s)]
*  And there have been like, I don't know, there are the president or pardon is power is expansive and presidents have used it in in different ways. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=460.24s)]
*  Some work corrupt than others. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=469.47999999999996s)]
*  Some just outright corrupt. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=470.71999999999997s)]
*  Right. We've seen that. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=471.91999999999996s)]
*  And sometimes presidents use it like President Obama used it like President Biden used it right for for clemency and pardons for people convicted of nonviolent drug offenses for people that were kicked out of the military for being gay. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=472.59999999999997s)]
*  Then you have pardons that are more kind of like they are in service of an abuse of power. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=484.24s)]
*  You have Trump's pardons of a bunch of people that were involved in crimes around him. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=489.0s)]
*  You have George H.W. Bush's pardons around Iran, Contra. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=493.92s)]
*  Then you have these kind of like corrupt hand of God pardons that are just like, I'm just doing a favor. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=496.52000000000004s)]
*  I'm saying fuck it on my way out the door. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=501.68s)]
*  You read the Jimmy Carter ones. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=503.28000000000003s)]
*  What are the Jimmy? They're incredible. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=506.24s)]
*  Keep going. I'll tell you later. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=507.96000000000004s)]
*  But like there's there's there's the Mark Rich pardon. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=508.88s)]
*  There's the Roger Clinton pardon. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=511.96000000000004s)]
*  And then I put this pardon in that list, just like it's a fuck it last out the door pardon. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=514.2s)]
*  Actually, the Charles Kushner one is like that for sure. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=518.52s)]
*  Two. What's strange about this is, A, it comes now. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=521.1999999999999s)]
*  B, there's no acknowledgment in the statement that part of the rationale should be that Donald Trump is about to become president. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=524.36s)]
*  Right. The statement is very kind of like, I don't know, like kind of imperious or sympathy inducing. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=529.8s)]
*  And it's like, oh, you pity me. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=536.92s)]
*  Like he's been sober for a long time. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=539.04s)]
*  There's a lot of people on whom like the gears of justice have like turned while they were trying desperately to maintain their sobriety. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=540.84s)]
*  And no pardons for them. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=547.64s)]
*  Kind of point out to on that point, when Joe Biden decided to run in 2019, Hunter had already gone through a lot of these challenges. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=549.0400000000001s)]
*  And so the time you could make a decision that would protect Hunter Biden from the kind of political glare and from Republican attacks was then. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=556.76s)]
*  I mean, I'm sorry to say that. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=565.96s)]
*  I think that Joe Biden is a tragic figure. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=567.08s)]
*  Like, and I think that there are many good parts of it. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=570.6s)]
*  I mean, you talked about this back in the whole post debate. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=574.3199999999999s)]
*  Is he going to drop out thing? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=577.36s)]
*  The two Joe Biden's kind of thing. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=578.28s)]
*  But I do think like he has shown incredible decency at times. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=579.28s)]
*  And I really feel for what he's gone through and what his family has gone through. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=583.3199999999999s)]
*  They've gone through hell. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=587.36s)]
*  Like none of us can imagine what they've gone through. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=588.4s)]
*  But like his ego again and again has like gotten in the way. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=591.8s)]
*  And when push comes to shove, it's like, well, I'm going to do what's good. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=596.76s)]
*  I'm going to run for president again, even though it's fucking crazy to do that. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=600.0799999999999s)]
*  And like I shouldn't do it and blah, blah, blah. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=602.9599999999999s)]
*  I'm not I'm just going to do it. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=605.12s)]
*  You know, and now we're all here. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=606.04s)]
*  And like this to me is like in that category. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=607.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's also the timing. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=610.4399999999999s)]
*  I do think the timing matters. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=611.7199999999999s)]
*  Like if this did come on Christmas Eve or it did come [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=613.7199999999999s)]
*  in a couple of weeks after he'd done some kind of [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=617.36s)]
*  pardons or something around being afraid of Donald Trump abusing his office, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=621.12s)]
*  it might have been different. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=625.28s)]
*  Do you guys have a guess on the timing or have you read anything? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=626.3199999999999s)]
*  I thought it was because of the sentencing. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=629.3199999999999s)]
*  One of the sentencing is December 12th for the gun charges. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=630.48s)]
*  The other is December 16th for tax evasion. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=633.44s)]
*  So I figured you just didn't want to go to jail. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=635.6s)]
*  He's going to sort it out now. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=637.9200000000001s)]
*  I know I saw that, too. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=639.12s)]
*  But then I thought this is why I think that this is what's confusing about this. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=640.44s)]
*  The full and unconditional pardon, because you could have imagined a scenario [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=644.28s)]
*  where Hunter gets sentenced and then Biden commutes the sentence [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=647.84s)]
*  or, you know, says that he's going to serve less or whatever else and waits for it. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=652.96s)]
*  But if you're going to do the full ten years, full and unconditional pardon, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=656.9200000000001s)]
*  we haven't really seen in this country since Ford pardoned Nixon. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=660.44s)]
*  I was reading that even Trump's pardons were like pardoning all of his cronies [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=665.72s)]
*  and pals and family members for like specific crimes. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=669.9200000000001s)]
*  And this is everything. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=673.0400000000001s)]
*  It does make the argument that this was about Trump coming, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=674.0s)]
*  returning to power and going after Hunter like more salient, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=678.12s)]
*  in which case you think, why doesn't why don't a whole bunch of other people [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=681.6800000000001s)]
*  Trump's going to go after get the same thing? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=685.2s)]
*  Exactly. And Hunter pleaded guilty and was convicted on crimes [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=686.6800000000001s)]
*  that are ancillary to the kind of core conservative critique, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=689.76s)]
*  the course sleaziness of Hunter Biden, which is the brismas stuff [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=693.84s)]
*  and some of the trading of influence, right, which were not part of these charges. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=697.24s)]
*  And now that slate is wiped clean. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=701.0s)]
*  So, of course, conservatives are going to say, see, Joe Biden is just protecting himself. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=703.36s)]
*  Yeah, I think they assume that it's just going to be lawfare. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=706.6s)]
*  But I agree. I mean, Joe Biden made it worse for himself for his own reputation. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=708.84s)]
*  I don't I do not believe I've never seen any evidence [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=712.6s)]
*  to suggest that Joe Biden was getting money from Hunter Biden's business. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=715.08s)]
*  No, the safe some for the big guy email. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=718.24s)]
*  None of it makes any sense. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=721.04s)]
*  None of it has been squared with like financial records [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=722.16s)]
*  or other information that I think would have made would approve this case. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=725.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's why it's that's why it's just like so now he's done this. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=729.76s)]
*  OK, if in the next couple of weeks, Joe Biden uses the pardon power again, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=733.72s)]
*  it will always be in the context of this Hunter Biden pardon, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=737.92s)]
*  the sort of strange decision to put this out on a Sunday night and will also, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=740.92s)]
*  by the way, also comes at a moment when we're about to have a debate about [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=746.84s)]
*  cash, Patel and about abuse of the Justice Department and abuse of the FBI. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=750.1600000000001s)]
*  Now, if anybody uses the Hunter Biden pardon as a justification [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=753.4s)]
*  for approving these fucking bozos, they will always wanted that permission. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=757.52s)]
*  And like, I don't they don't need they don't need it. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=761.0s)]
*  So I'm not like they're like, oh, you've just given them ammunition. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=763.64s)]
*  I don't care about that. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=767.0400000000001s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=768.0400000000001s)]
*  I care about the internal credibility of the Democratic Party [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=768.5600000000001s)]
*  and people who fought for Joe Biden to be president. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=772.08s)]
*  Can I ask you guys, because I it obviously bothers all three of us. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=775.1600000000001s)]
*  I've had like friends, family members be like, who cares about this? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=779.2s)]
*  Like if I was Biden, I'd do it, too. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=783.6s)]
*  And look, if like I would pardon my sons, probably if I was in that position. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=785.48s)]
*  It's still wrong. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=789.6800000000001s)]
*  Like, I mean, I hope I wouldn't. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=791.36s)]
*  I hope I wouldn't be in that position. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=793.24s)]
*  But like, I don't know. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=794.4s)]
*  I mean, Tommy, you you raised the point that you're worried [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=795.44s)]
*  about the credibility of the Democratic Party. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=798.0400000000001s)]
*  If we just went through an election where people decided [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=801.08s)]
*  eh, don't really care much about norms and institutions and democracy [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=804.6800000000001s)]
*  as much as they care about inflation and other and other issues [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=808.4s)]
*  that affect their lives directly. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=811.2s)]
*  Do you think conversely that this would actually piss people off? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=813.24s)]
*  Yes, very much. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=816.36s)]
*  They think they care about people being full of shit. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=817.28s)]
*  They care about corruption. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=819.8000000000001s)]
*  They care about hypocrisy. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=820.88s)]
*  My guess is that like if you pull people right now, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=823.6s)]
*  it would be the majority of people would understand it on a human level. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=826.9200000000001s)]
*  But that support for this decision would kind of track Joe Biden's approval. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=831.52s)]
*  But then you lose a bunch of Democrats, right? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=835.88s)]
*  Because we, I think, believe in good government. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=837.9599999999999s)]
*  And so I don't know. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=840.0799999999999s)]
*  I don't think this will wear well over time. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=840.92s)]
*  I don't know that this will be [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=843.28s)]
*  one of the top five things that we talk about. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=845.72s)]
*  But I do think it's a it's a tough way to go out. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=848.64s)]
*  You know, when you're it's hard, it's hard to when you're at the bottom there. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=850.76s)]
*  Do you know his approval rating right now? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=856.52s)]
*  So Trump's approval rating when he left office after inciting an insurrection [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=858.52s)]
*  and trying to overturn the election was 38 percent. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=862.5600000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden right now is sitting at 37 percent. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=866.08s)]
*  Tough. I guess for me, like, I do think that what happens [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=868.48s)]
*  in the next couple of weeks matters for what this pardon looks like in hindsight. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=872.6800000000001s)]
*  If he if he doesn't like we have a short window for Joe Biden [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=875.6800000000001s)]
*  to use presidential authority to do everything he can to to to protect [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=879.36s)]
*  the country against abuse of power by Donald Trump and his cronies. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=883.88s)]
*  And if he doesn't use the pardon power in the next couple of weeks [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=887.72s)]
*  and what we're left with is Hunter Biden doesn't get to be subjected [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=890.96s)]
*  to kind of capricious right wingers in the Department of Justice. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=894.84s)]
*  But all these other people do, as you said, Liz Cheney, Fauci, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=899.2s)]
*  Mark Milley, journalists, whoever it may be. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=902.48s)]
*  That will be, I think, quite an indictment of of this pardon. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=905.76s)]
*  I am right now mostly frustrated by the timing of it and the kind of, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=909.12s)]
*  I don't know, the the the kind of the falseness of the statement. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=912.6s)]
*  Which doesn't acknowledge that this is like I don't know what Joe Biden [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=917.6400000000001s)]
*  would have done if Kamala Harris won. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=920.44s)]
*  Maybe he would have done this anyway. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=922.12s)]
*  But I would have like some acknowledgement that this is because he's worried [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=923.76s)]
*  about future abuses of power. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=926.84s)]
*  And I would have wanted this to be in the context of all these other people [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=928.24s)]
*  that Donald Trump has done. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=932.0s)]
*  You know what I was thinking? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=933.12s)]
*  Should have done it during the campaign. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=934.24s)]
*  Boy, would it have given Kamala an opportunity to finally break from Biden. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=936.2s)]
*  Kamala, the cop could have come down hard on that one. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=940.5600000000001s)]
*  I walk this back. That's right. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=943.84s)]
*  That's right. Turn a bug into a feature. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=945.52s)]
*  One more thing before you like the pardon power is crazy. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=947.92s)]
*  Yeah, by the way. Yeah. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=950.76s)]
*  And like, I think, first of all, I think upheld recently one Supreme Court. Right. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=952.04s)]
*  We have learned over the last eight years now, if something is a norm [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=957.0s)]
*  and it's important, maybe make it a law. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=961.0799999999999s)]
*  Right. Because the norms are the norms are gone. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=963.96s)]
*  Trump doesn't go abide by norms. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=966.28s)]
*  No one seemed to care. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=968.96s)]
*  He campaigned on not abiding by norms. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=970.04s)]
*  No one seemed to care. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=971.88s)]
*  No one seemed to care that he promised to pardon people who assaulted [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=972.8s)]
*  police officers on their way to overturn an election. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=975.36s)]
*  That was fine. That didn't ruin Trump. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=977.92s)]
*  Well, this is what I mean by hinting that, right? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=979.84s)]
*  He would like basically not exactly describe who would get the pardon. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=981.64s)]
*  We say the worst people wouldn't. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=985.4s)]
*  One one one reporter at the at the at the National Association of Black Journalists [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=987.16s)]
*  said even the ones who assaulted police officers like, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=990.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I guess that's true. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=993.64s)]
*  So but anyway, I do think Steve, Representative Steve Cohen, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=994.88s)]
*  Democrat, tweeted that he has had a constitutional amendment [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=998.76s)]
*  to reform pardon power so that it bans pardons for the president's family, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1003.12s)]
*  staff crimes committed for their benefit. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1007.24s)]
*  It's a constitutional amendment. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1009.4399999999999s)]
*  We can't barely keep the government open. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1010.52s)]
*  So whatever. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1012.24s)]
*  But it did make me think I'm like, yeah, if he's like, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1013.68s)]
*  I've also had no Republican co-sponsors in eight years on this proposal. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1016.68s)]
*  He's like, if anyone wants to join. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1021.04s)]
*  But I do think like I think the pardon power is is like so ripe for abuse. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1022.64s)]
*  And yeah, I'd be for a constitutional moment that would maybe rein it in a bit. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1026.88s)]
*  If you go back and look, I mean, it's not just right. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1029.96s)]
*  It's been abused. It's often often abused. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1031.88s)]
*  If you go back in. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1034.44s)]
*  So I was just reading about pardons and just for the fun of it [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1035.3200000000002s)]
*  and just reading what Nixon was saying about why he was pardoning Jimmy Hoffa. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1039.24s)]
*  And by the way, it sort of, you know, probably ultimately was not to Jimmy [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1043.0s)]
*  Hoffa's benefit because where he go, but, you know, it's like, yeah, you know, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1045.8000000000002s)]
*  careful what you wish for a good outcome. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1050.16s)]
*  But he's just basically saying like, come, come, we got to do this [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1051.72s)]
*  because because it's basically helping us in the 72 election. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1054.44s)]
*  Wait, Tommy, before we move on, can you give us the Jimmy Carter ones? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1057.24s)]
*  Well, I hope these are right, because I just got them off of Twitter. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1059.6000000000001s)]
*  But G Gordon, Liddy, Peter Yarrow from Peter, Paul and Mary, who did something. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1061.64s)]
*  I don't know the details of with a 14 year old, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1066.1200000000001s)]
*  the Vietnam War Draft Resisters, all of them blanket Jefferson Davis [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1069.1200000000001s)]
*  of the comparison, David, when they got my part. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1073.4s)]
*  So wild set of set there. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1075.64s)]
*  I mean, look, yeah, big picture. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1077.52s)]
*  I just it's look, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1078.96s)]
*  we had this fight over norms, institutions, trust in government. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1082.04s)]
*  We lost. But I do think this erodes people's faith in the justice system. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1084.72s)]
*  It erodes people's faith in the my belief that the prosecutions [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1089.96s)]
*  of Donald Trump were fair. Yeah. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1094.44s)]
*  John Joe Biden has been championing the rules based international order [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1097.72s)]
*  and norms and institutions, and then he jettisoned them [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1102.44s)]
*  when his son needs a party, a pardon or when our party. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1105.3999999999999s)]
*  That's a party. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1109.04s)]
*  I bet it's going to be quite a party for him tonight. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1109.52s)]
*  When Bibi Netanyahu is is the one getting prosecuted for war crimes [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1111.76s)]
*  and not Vladimir Putin, right? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1116.0s)]
*  I mean, just like it's very situational. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1117.32s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, yeah, he could have he could have come out and pardoned [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1119.36s)]
*  Trump and Hunter at the same time on on political press. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1122.32s)]
*  That would have been actually hilarious. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1125.72s)]
*  You could have because this is so mad. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1126.84s)]
*  This is so mad. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1129.36s)]
*  This gets to your problem. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1130.28s)]
*  Tell me that like if if you're going to argue that the Justice Department, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1131.08s)]
*  by the way, Biden's Justice Department unfairly targeted Hunter Biden [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1135.28s)]
*  and that Hunter Biden would never have been targeted, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1139.52s)]
*  were he not the president's son, then you can look at Alvin Bragg's case, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1141.52s)]
*  of course, and think that like, yes, what Trump did was illegal. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1144.72s)]
*  And it's good that he got convicted because he broke the law. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1147.44s)]
*  But would he would someone like Trump have gotten targeted [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1149.52s)]
*  if he was not President Trump? Yeah. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1152.28s)]
*  I mean, I'm not I'm not I know. I know. I know. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1154.56s)]
*  I'm not arguing. That's why I'm saying like, again, it's it's why like [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1157.04s)]
*  you don't have to you don't have to think like it has a political effect [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1160.96s)]
*  or gives the Republicans ammunition or anything else to just think like. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1164.32s)]
*  Sometimes things are just wrong. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1167.28s)]
*  If we believe in if we believe in laws and everything else is just wrong. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1168.96s)]
*  This is why this is why, again, like, as I said, like weeks ago, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1171.96s)]
*  I think I think Joe Biden gets one. Pardon your son. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1175.1200000000001s)]
*  Fuck it. It's your fuck it. Pardon. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1177.52s)]
*  You win. You know, you're you're you're everybody will understand. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1178.92s)]
*  But the statement is what's killing me. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1181.8s)]
*  And just to knowingly lie about it. Yeah. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1183.52s)]
*  And destroying a bunch of people along and make your staff lie about it. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1185.6s)]
*  Like like his press secretary, it's like she lied about it all the time. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1188.32s)]
*  So just say like I I originally had not planned to do this. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1191.76s)]
*  Donald Trump winning has made me nervous that that they will try to use my son [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1194.6399999999999s)]
*  to get at me and score political points. It's a dangerous time. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1198.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm going to pardon my son, Hunter. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1200.6799999999998s)]
*  I'm also issuing pardons for anyone that Donald Trump or those who he's planning [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1201.84s)]
*  to put in position of authority have been threatened with political prosecutions. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1205.3999999999999s)]
*  We do not do political prosecutions with the major exception of POTS of America. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1208.24s)]
*  Yeah. All right. Yeah. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1212.0s)]
*  God, man. What? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1213.52s)]
*  No one's going to say. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1215.24s)]
*  Let me actually say I want to revise my opinion, which is to say, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1216.6s)]
*  I would like Joe Biden to issue some pardons in advance, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1219.84s)]
*  but not so many that they go down the list far enough to get to us. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1223.24s)]
*  Leave some big targets on there. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1226.52s)]

*  No, absolutely. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1376.84s)]
*  Down with the deep state. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1378.96s)]
*  This has long been rumored that Cash Patel was going to get this. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1380.12s)]
*  Now it's apparently coming true, even though Chris Ray nominally has three [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1382.8799999999999s)]
*  years left in his 10 year term. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1386.72s)]
*  If you haven't made it past the headlines, Patel is a former prosecutor [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1389.12s)]
*  who became a staffer on the House Intel Committee under Devin Nunes. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1392.72s)]
*  Oh, Devin Nunes. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1396.28s)]
*  Let's talk about someone from season one where he became a critic [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1397.16s)]
*  of the Russia investigation and became a Trump world rising star. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1401.08s)]
*  Patel worked at various jobs in the White House and the executive branch [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1406.24s)]
*  and hung around with Trump after he left office. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1409.16s)]
*  You may remember him getting wrapped up in the classified documents [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1411.96s)]
*  investigation, but Patel's biggest claim to fame is for being the [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1414.88s)]
*  purest and most outspoken warrior against the so-called deep state [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1418.76s)]

*  Do you believe that you can deliver the goods on this in a pretty short [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1441.4s)]
*  in a pretty short order of the first couple of months so we can get [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1444.0800000000002s)]

*  But yeah, we're putting you all on notice. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1462.4s)]
*  And Steve, this is why they hate us. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1464.0s)]
*  This is why we're tyrannical. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1465.72s)]
*  This is why we're dictators. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1466.92s)]
*  Well, got that part right. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1468.28s)]
*  Oh boy. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1474.0s)]
*  There's a very season one story. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1475.3600000000001s)]
*  You dig an inch into this and you're getting back to Nellie or [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1476.76s)]

*  It's tough. It's terrible. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1482.84s)]
*  So there was some chatter in the crooked slack about whether Cash Patel is the [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1485.28s)]
*  new worst nominee now that Matt Gaetz withdrew. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1488.28s)]
*  What do you guys think? How worried should we be about Cash Patel? [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1491.36s)]
*  I think very worried. I think this is now the worst one. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1494.04s)]
*  I think if Matt Gaetz were still in contention, you might have a debate, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1496.72s)]
*  but it's now intellectual exercise. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1499.6399999999999s)]
*  So Patel gets to be the worst one. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1500.9199999999998s)]
*  There was a great profile in the Atlantic of Cash Patel that people should read. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1503.0s)]
*  But there was one line that jumped out at me from [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1507.2s)]
*  an adviser to Trump who said that Cash is the one you say to, hey, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1511.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm not telling you to go break into the DNC, but dot dot dot. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1514.72s)]
*  And that to me is what makes this so nerve wracking. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1519.68s)]
*  You look at like he doesn't seem to have a very strong ideology. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1524.56s)]
*  But but then you you nothing is more. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1529.72s)]
*  He was a DOJ under Obama. Right. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1532.28s)]
*  And nothing is more, I think, disconcerting than anyone [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1534.12s)]
*  who has become a rising star in Trump world. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1537.1599999999999s)]
*  And why is a right? [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1539.52s)]
*  Why is he a rising Trump in in in Trump world? [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1540.4399999999998s)]
*  Because he is a lackey. He will say anything. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1543.08s)]
*  You mentioned the classified documents investigation when he was interviewed [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1545.08s)]
*  by Breitbart and he said, oh, actually, Trump declassified all that stuff. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1548.84s)]

*  He is the guy that says what Trump needs him to say, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1557.52s)]
*  who does what Trump needs him to do, which is why he wants him [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1560.12s)]

*  Yeah. I mean, look, me and Rhodes have been on the on the cash [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1566.28s)]
*  but tell watch for a very long time. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1568.8799999999999s)]
*  This guy is not remotely qualified to lead the FBI. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1570.12s)]
*  He's never worked for the FBI. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1572.96s)]
*  He barely worked in law enforcement. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1574.04s)]
*  He's a limited experience. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1575.32s)]
*  He was a public defender, which is a great job. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1576.6399999999999s)]
*  Not one that, you know, qualifies you to lead the FBI. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1578.96s)]
*  He's a congressional aide. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1581.3999999999999s)]
*  And then kind of bounced around the Trump administration. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1582.3999999999999s)]
*  He says he was chief of staff at the Pentagon, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1584.6399999999999s)]
*  but he was the chief of staff there for two months to the acting secretary of defense. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1586.32s)]
*  So his boss during the Trump administration, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1589.76s)]
*  a guy named Charles Cooperman said, quote, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1594.56s)]
*  he's absolutely unqualified for this job. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1596.68s)]
*  He's untrustworthy. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1599.08s)]
*  It's an absolute disgrace to American citizens to even consider an individual of this nature. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1600.52s)]
*  A former Trump official, you say, who worked for the Trump administration. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1605.2s)]
*  Yeah. So like base what? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1608.44s)]
*  Love to hear him at the confirmation hearing. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1609.76s)]
*  You say that. I hope they call him. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1611.28s)]
*  So love it. Summary of him is correct, which is he just he tells Trump [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1612.68s)]
*  what he wants to hear. He feeds his paranoia about the deep state. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1617.12s)]
*  There's no evidence that this guy's a reformer who has big ideas for how the FBI could be better. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1620.4799999999998s)]
*  What there is a lot of evidence of is that Cash Patel is someone who keeps an enemy's list. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1625.8799999999999s)]
*  In fact, he published it in his book and includes people like Bill Barr and John Bolton, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1630.0s)]
*  who worked for Trump, to John Brennan and Loretta Lynch, who were Obama aides to Hillary Clinton. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1634.1999999999998s)]
*  Tim Miller tweeted out this full list. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1640.56s)]
*  It includes Cassidy Hutchinson, who was an assistant to Mark Meadows. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1642.04s)]
*  This is apparently like the leading lights of the deep state. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1646.2s)]
*  Just like random people who are mean to Donald Trump. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1648.68s)]
*  He just didn't like personally and had been personal interaction. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1651.36s)]
*  Right. Or was or was mean to cash personally. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1653.84s)]
*  But one of the most sort of disturbing allegations about cash [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1656.72s)]
*  Patel is from his time working at the Pentagon. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1660.56s)]
*  Long story short, Navy SEALs were preparing a rescue operation in Western Africa and Nigeria. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1663.92s)]
*  They needed to get permission from the Nigerian government to fly a US military plane [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1668.96s)]
*  into their airspace. According to Mark Esper, the secretary of defense, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1673.12s)]
*  Cash Patel just told everybody that they'd gotten this permission. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1676.36s)]
*  He said he'd gotten the word from Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1680.32s)]
*  and no one realized that he had just made it up. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1683.6799999999998s)]
*  They were about to land or about to go into Nigerian airspace and figured out, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1686.52s)]
*  wait, Cash Patel just made up that we had permission. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1690.56s)]
*  So these guys circled and circled and circled. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1692.8799999999999s)]
*  They almost had to call off a rescue operation. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1694.84s)]
*  And luckily, they got permission. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1697.28s)]
*  They landed. They rescued this guy and everything was OK. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1699.8799999999999s)]
*  But the worst case scenario is you've got a plane full of Navy SEALs getting shot at [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1703.12s)]
*  by the Nigerian military or the hostage gets shot at because they had to abandon the mission. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1707.8s)]
*  Yeah, because so it you know, you could have had a bunch of people killed. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1712.04s)]
*  So it's a very it's a bizarre selection. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1714.8799999999999s)]
*  It's someone who's just a Trump ask his sir acolyte and not ready for this. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1718.08s)]
*  But could I interest you in some cash wine? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1724.6399999999999s)]
*  He sells it for two hundred and thirty three dollars and ninety nine cents for six bottles. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1728.6s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. He's he's a real it's good. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1733.04s)]
*  So I didn't understand until I got into the Atlantic piece what a grifter he is. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1735.04s)]
*  I mean, I'm not surprised by that, but he really goes after it a lot. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1738.52s)]
*  There's some. So when you dig into this guy, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1741.88s)]
*  there's all the ways in which he is just sort of a Trump crony who will abuse his power. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1745.12s)]
*  But the story Tommy is telling is really just strange because even Republicans [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1749.6s)]
*  that were like kind of baffled, they that like otherwise defenders of Trump. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1755.6s)]
*  Like, why would you do this? [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1759.88s)]
*  Like, why? Like, it's not like there wasn't an ideological partisan. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1761.48s)]
*  Well, the reason some people speculate that he just wanted it to happen, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1765.04s)]
*  wanted the operation to happen because it was almost the election. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1768.52s)]
*  Right. Right. And they wanted to win. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1770.56s)]
*  Right. So that he was willing to not willing to lie. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1772.56s)]
*  But like in such a kind of dangerous and unhinged way in that in that Atlantic piece, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1774.76s)]
*  there is a anecdote about basically this sort of shitty judge in Texas [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1779.64s)]
*  or uprating him for not wearing a tie. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1783.68s)]
*  It's like a very specific story. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1786.28s)]
*  But he's so agitated by it. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1788.4s)]
*  He keeps coming back to his bosses over and over again, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1790.56s)]
*  even looking for someone to kind of take his side. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1792.9199999999998s)]
*  He's like, what do you want us to do, man? [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1795.52s)]
*  Like, we're not going to make a record. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1796.9199999999998s)]
*  Like, like there's just this sort of like this is someone strange. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1798.6799999999998s)]
*  Someone you want in charge of the surveillance state and law enforcement. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1801.12s)]
*  He's also an author. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1804.6s)]
*  And I just want this kids book. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1806.24s)]
*  This is the description of the book. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1808.6799999999998s)]
*  Hillary Quinton and her shifty night, Adam Schiff, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1809.96s)]
*  have spread lies that King Donald had cheated to become king. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1813.2s)]
*  They claimed he was working with the Russianians. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1815.8799999999999s)]
*  But how could that be joint cash to distinguish discoverer [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1818.48s)]
*  as he uncovers the plot against the king? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1821.4s)]
*  And who was really behind all the lies? [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1823.36s)]
*  Weirdest thing about that is he just didn't. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1825.04s)]
*  Why didn't he just use Russians? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1826.6s)]
*  Because it's a magical world filled with Russianians. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1829.08s)]
*  You got to have a dual meaning for the parents and the kids. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1832.0s)]
*  And why would you meet get Hillary Quinton? [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1834.16s)]
*  I do. What's chilling back to what's scary and what's absurd. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1837.56s)]
*  The line that you mentioned, love it from the Trump advisor, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1842.48s)]
*  that he's the guy that says, you know, Trump says, hey, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1845.0s)]
*  I'm not telling you to go break into the DNC. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1846.76s)]
*  He's the kind of person that would not necessarily just take orders [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1849.4s)]
*  from Trump to do things that are horrible and illegal, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1854.16s)]
*  but just do them thinking that it would impress Trump. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1856.56s)]
*  That's it. Right. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1859.04s)]
*  And and also not seemingly be that competent about doing it. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1859.92s)]
*  As the Africa story suggests. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1863.76s)]
*  Well, and also a guy who would run an organization [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1865.96s)]
*  that has all the authorities it needs to surveil, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1868.2s)]
*  otherwise harass American citizens. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1871.6s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's going to be a trend today, too. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1873.6s)]
*  These are not people who have engendered esteem from even right wingers around them, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1876.08s)]
*  with which hopefully will damn their nominations, but would also, I think, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1880.6399999999999s)]
*  ultimately damn them if they were to attain these jobs. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1884.04s)]
*  Chris Hayes said on his show once that Cash Patel at the FBI [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1888.1999999999998s)]
*  is what would happen if you crossed J. Edgar Hoover with Alex Jones. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1892.3999999999999s)]
*  OK, I like that. Yeah. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1896.52s)]
*  That's chilling. Yeah, that's right. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1898.12s)]
*  One thing's for sure. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1901.04s)]
*  Pete Hagseth is trying to give Cash Patel a run for his money. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1901.84s)]
*  Trump's nominee to oversee the Defense Department's nearly [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1905.3200000000002s)]
*  three million employees and eight hundred and forty billion dollar budget [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1907.5200000000002s)]
*  is the subject of a new Jane Mayer investigation over at the New Yorker [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1911.3200000000002s)]
*  about Hagseth's tenure at two veterans organizations that he ran. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1914.5200000000002s)]
*  He apparently was forced out of concerned Veterans for America [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1918.68s)]
*  for being drunk in the office and even drunker at official events, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1922.64s)]
*  preying on female staffers and allegedly chanting, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1926.72s)]
*  kill all Muslims at a bar while on work travel. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1929.6000000000001s)]
*  Before that, he ran a group called Vets for Freedom, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1932.8s)]
*  where he reportedly racked up huge debt and once again instilled [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1935.0s)]
*  a culture permissive of sexual misconduct. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1937.88s)]
*  Apparently, he's such a shitbag that the New York Times [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1940.8s)]
*  got a hold of an email from his own mother in 2018, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1943.76s)]
*  where she took the side of his estranged wife during a legal battle. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1946.88s)]
*  She wrote to her son, You are an abuser of women. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1951.1200000000001s)]
*  That is the ugly truth. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1954.4s)]
*  And I have no respect for any man that belittles, lies, cheats, sleeps around [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1955.44s)]
*  and uses women for his own power and ego. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1959.04s)]
*  You are that man and have been for years. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1961.64s)]
*  And as your mother, it pains me and embarrasses me to say that. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1963.88s)]
*  But it is the sad, sad truth. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1967.48s)]
*  The Times reporter says that Hagseth told her that she immediately sent her son [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1970.76s)]
*  a follow up email apologizing and taking it back. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1974.64s)]
*  You know, it's a tough one to take back. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1977.68s)]
*  She said the things she wrote are not true and have never been true. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1978.96s)]
*  It's we've all gone through that with our moms. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1982.52s)]
*  You meant the first one. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1985.24s)]
*  You know what I mean? The walk back is what it is. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1986.52s)]
*  You probably felt bad about the first one, but you meant the first one. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1988.4s)]
*  Yeah, it was not true what I wrote in excruciating detail. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1990.88s)]
*  I like I had to the Times posted the email in full and then an article [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1995.72s)]
*  about the email and the article says that basically she regretted it. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=1999.24s)]
*  Wrote another email after which I did not see when I read the email first. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2003.52s)]
*  All I had seen. I was like, holy fucking shit. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2007.2s)]
*  Like my mom got no. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2010.6000000000001s)]
*  And I got no little argument because my fridge broke. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2011.68s)]
*  And the question was whether or not we could cook the turkey, you know, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2014.0s)]
*  and it got heated, but not like this. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2016.64s)]
*  No, I didn't see that. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2018.64s)]
*  I didn't see her friends reaction in the New York Times. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2019.72s)]
*  Well, the fridge prevent the cooking of the fridge broke. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2021.96s)]
*  And so the turkey had been at about 50 degrees overnight to warm. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2025.24s)]
*  And it had well, we didn't know when it became 50 degrees. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2029.0800000000002s)]
*  I was a bit stubborn. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2031.72s)]
*  I was after had been spatch. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2032.64s)]
*  It had and I had to go run out and spatchcock a second fucking turkey. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2033.8400000000001s)]
*  I spatchcocked two turkeys. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2037.0s)]
*  Oh, look at you. Yeah. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2038.1200000000001s)]
*  What a weekend. Yeah. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2039.3600000000001s)]
*  R.F.K. over there. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2041.68s)]
*  Anyway, Pete. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2044.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2045.88s)]
*  Does this change what we know about Hickseth in any meaningful ways? [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2049.32s)]
*  Certainly on the like sexual abuser [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2052.1600000000003s)]
*  misconduct category, I think it just strengthens the case there. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2055.84s)]
*  But the the mismanagement of an organization or two organizations. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2059.8s)]
*  It feels like that's notable. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2065.04s)]
*  Yeah. The U.S. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2066.04s)]
*  military has a huge problem with sexual assault and both preventing it [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2066.6s)]
*  and holding those accountable. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2070.8s)]
*  Part of that problem was that the decisions being made about who [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2071.84s)]
*  to prosecute, whether or not to prosecute these guys, was being made [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2075.2000000000003s)]
*  within the chain of command and not by independent prosecutors. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2078.1200000000003s)]
*  Pete Hickseth would be at the top of that chain of command. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2080.96s)]
*  Right. So I think that this is actually a uniquely serious problem [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2083.36s)]
*  in the U.S. military if he were to be the leader of it. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2087.0s)]
*  Joni Ernst, Republican senator from Iowa, did a lot of work [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2089.92s)]
*  trying to reform the system. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2092.76s)]
*  I'd love to hear what she thinks about Pete Hickseth leading this organization. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2094.0400000000004s)]
*  By the way, was also rumored to be on the shortlist for defense secretary. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2097.36s)]
*  And then was spotted last week at Mar-a-Lago with Trump. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2101.2000000000003s)]
*  So maybe he's already having second thoughts. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2104.44s)]
*  Now, let's say that other allegation, let's say it's not true. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2106.16s)]
*  OK, what is not disputed is that Pete Hickseth is a serial adulterer, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2108.7200000000003s)]
*  which in the U.S. military can get you a year in prison or dishonorable discharge. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2113.4s)]
*  Right. I'm not like I'm not here to scold people for personal failings or whatever. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2117.88s)]
*  But I'm just saying if you go by the UCMJ, these are big deals. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2122.96s)]
*  Also true for public intoxication and drunkenness. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2127.36s)]
*  Clearly reading all these articles, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2130.7200000000003s)]
*  Pete Hickseth has a pretty serious drinking problem, or at least did pretty recently. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2132.36s)]
*  And so the last part that you're getting at, Jon, was the New Yorker story [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2136.76s)]
*  talks about his mismanagement of an organization that has between five [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2140.8s)]
*  and ten people and a five and ten million dollar budget. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2144.96s)]
*  So now we're going to take this dude who can't run that organization, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2147.96s)]
*  put him in charge of the Department of Defense, which employs nearly three [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2151.1200000000003s)]
*  million people and has a yearly budget of over eight hundred billion dollars. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2154.44s)]
*  Yeah. So and also like, again, similar to the people [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2158.6800000000003s)]
*  that have been behind the scenes saying they're worried about cash [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2162.28s)]
*  but tell like this is concerned veterans for America is not like they were. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2164.44s)]
*  Concerned. They got pretty concerned. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2168.92s)]
*  These are some concerned, concerned veterans. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2171.1200000000003s)]
*  But but this is an Americans for Prosperity group. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2173.1200000000003s)]
*  This is a Koch brothers group. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2176.1600000000003s)]
*  These are conservatives inside of this organization. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2177.36s)]
*  And one person said, I've seen him dragged away, not a few times, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2180.48s)]
*  but multiple times to have him at the Pentagon would be scary. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2185.1200000000003s)]
*  When those of us who worked at CVA heard he was being considered for sect, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2187.84s)]
*  it wasn't no, it was hell no. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2191.24s)]
*  Like the people that have worked with him are like, are you out of your fucking minds? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2193.44s)]
*  You guys remember when Trump's former [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2197.08s)]
*  defense secretary, Jim Mattis, said that he used to sleep in his clothes [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2199.4s)]
*  because he was so worried that in the middle of the night, he'd get a call [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2203.96s)]
*  that Trump might start a nuclear war with North Korea. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2206.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean, Pete Hicks, I'd just be drunk. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2210.24s)]
*  Just blackout. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2211.64s)]
*  The good news is he wouldn't wouldn't wake up to get a call. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2212.2799999999997s)]
*  So we wouldn't have to worry about the word of the morning. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2214.48s)]
*  Yeah. Mr. President, could you just give me two more? [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2216.2s)]
*  Yeah, we got we got we got Donald Trump, Kim Jong-un, autocrats around the world, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2219.2s)]
*  nuclear weapons and Pete Hicks, just hammered just walking around the Pentagon. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2223.8799999999997s)]
*  But again, I mean, you you wouldn't be able to get a security clearance [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2227.7999999999997s)]
*  or pass a background check with this rap sheet. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2230.6s)]
*  And now this guy is going to be in the nuclear chain of command. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2232.7999999999997s)]
*  Seems bad. There was another passage from the Jane Mayer piece [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2236.08s)]
*  that I just thought was striking. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2238.7599999999998s)]
*  It included the phrase, phrase, close down the bar at the Sheraton [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2240.24s)]
*  Suites Hotel. I thought that was a bad sign. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2243.68s)]
*  This is all around the the kill all Muslims part is what is all taking place [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2245.76s)]
*  during this section. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2249.28s)]
*  The staffer letter cited a second incident in which which Hexette [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2251.0s)]
*  passed out in the back of a party bus, then urinated in front of a hotel [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2253.88s)]
*  where CVAC was staying. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2257.6800000000003s)]
*  I'll tell you this because the truth and I sincerely care about the mission of CVA. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2259.0400000000004s)]
*  Now, just to give you a sense of like these are conservatives. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2262.84s)]
*  When that person when Jane Mayer reached out for that person, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2265.5200000000004s)]
*  that person said, if you print that, I will deny I wrote it. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2268.6800000000003s)]
*  When he reminded when he was reminded by Jane Mayer [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2272.5200000000004s)]
*  that it had been sent from the same personal email account that he still used, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2274.84s)]
*  he said, I don't care. I'll just say it never happened. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2277.6400000000003s)]
*  Like these are sounds like sounds like he might have petered a Sheraton [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2280.88s)]
*  a few times to listen. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2283.76s)]
*  We've all listened to outside of Sheraton Suites. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2284.96s)]
*  All right. Listen, party bus, you know, this guy's a top notch liar, though. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2287.84s)]
*  It'd be like, listen, on the record, if you print my thing, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2293.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm going to say it's a lie. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2296.88s)]
*  It's an incredible strategy. So good. So you know what? [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2298.1600000000003s)]
*  His name wasn't printed. So when for that guy? [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2301.56s)]
*  All right. So we now have several all time. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2304.96s)]
*  Most awful nominees lined up to run some of the most powerful agencies in government. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2308.6000000000004s)]
*  We got Hegseth at defense, Patel at the FBI, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2312.88s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard in charge of the intelligence agencies. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2315.36s)]
*  And don't forget, R.F.K. Junior in charge of public health. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2318.2000000000003s)]
*  Defeating any of these nominations would require four Republican senators [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2320.52s)]
*  to oppose them. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2324.32s)]
*  So far, a few Republicans have made mildly critical [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2325.28s)]
*  or at least not fully supportive comments about Hegseth, Gabbard [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2328.92s)]
*  and R.F.K. Junior. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2332.76s)]
*  No real vocal opposition to Patel just yet. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2334.1600000000003s)]
*  Democrats are obviously playing defense against a lot of horrible nominees. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2337.64s)]
*  How do you guys think they should be thinking about the strategy here? [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2341.56s)]
*  Like, should Democrats be fighting back against every unqualified, dangerous [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2344.96s)]
*  nominee? Do we need to pick and choose? [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2349.2400000000002s)]
*  There's the need to be an overall strategy to deal with all of them. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2351.44s)]
*  What do you think? Well, first of all, we've already picked and choose [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2353.88s)]
*  because Linda McMahon is also on on on on deck to be secretary of education. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2356.1600000000003s)]
*  These are just the four worst ones. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2360.8s)]
*  They'll also run through four different committees if we still live in a world [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2362.7200000000003s)]
*  where there are cabinet confirmation hearings, but they'd be through [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2365.88s)]
*  judiciary, intelligence, armed services and the health committee. Right. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2370.2400000000002s)]
*  Those are four groups of senators who all have the ability to decide [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2374.32s)]
*  how they want to mount this argument with their fellow senators. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2377.88s)]
*  So to me, it's just like, I don't we're sort of still waiting for [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2381.0800000000004s)]
*  what a group of Republicans who have their own specific issues and concerns, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2386.2000000000003s)]
*  where they're going to have backbone, where they're going to be trying to back [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2391.96s)]
*  channel to have these nominations withdrawn so they don't have to go out [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2394.76s)]
*  and go up against Trump, where they're going to be willing to draw the line. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2397.52s)]
*  Like, we just have no idea. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2399.88s)]
*  And we were talking about this before time, but like Democrats [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2401.28s)]
*  aren't even really shotgun in this fight. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2404.0s)]
*  We're just riding along. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2406.48s)]
*  And so it's just like none of these people should be in positions of authority. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2407.48s)]
*  And some might get through. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2411.2400000000002s)]
*  We don't know, but we should fight as if they can all be defeated. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2412.76s)]
*  I don't know what else we would do. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2415.52s)]
*  It's a question of emphasis, right? [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2417.28s)]
*  I mean, because we don't have the power to block anybody. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2418.64s)]
*  All we can do is get information to the public domain and make it [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2421.4s)]
*  politically damaging for Trump or the Republicans who vote for these nominees. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2424.68s)]
*  And so, I mean, I guess Republicans could try to sort of collapse [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2427.92s)]
*  the time frame of the hearings, do them all at once, do certain things [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2431.44s)]
*  that make it harder to tell a story about all of these nominees [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2434.48s)]
*  or anyone individually. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2437.88s)]
*  But I do think it's more about the framing because we just can't be [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2439.32s)]
*  like the norms and institutions party and the ones who are opposed to change. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2443.96s)]
*  Except on the pardon. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2449.16s)]
*  Whereas Trump's people are all like radical disruptors coming in [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2450.16s)]
*  to change the government that everyone just voted against because they hate it. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2454.3599999999997s)]
*  Right. I mean, that's where I'm concerned. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2457.44s)]
*  It's just I worry about the Democrats in the US Senate [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2460.2s)]
*  coming at like a bunch of traditionalists coming at these arguments [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2464.68s)]
*  in the most traditional kind of institution defending ways [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2468.04s)]
*  and not being remotely compelling. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2471.8s)]
*  I think it's these are a bunch of grifting kooks who will put our health [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2474.0s)]
*  and lives in danger and our security. Right. Right. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2479.2400000000002s)]
*  It's going to be about how it would affect. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2481.36s)]
*  Or if Cash Mattel is spending all his time going after Trump's enemies, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2482.76s)]
*  who is focused on combating ISIS or foreign espionage or human [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2485.92s)]
*  trafficking or all those fucking L.A. rich kids that said they were [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2489.6000000000004s)]
*  on the rowing team that got into great schools. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2493.2400000000002s)]
*  That's what we need the FBI doing. Justice should be served. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2496.84s)]
*  I don't know. Was it called Varsity Blues? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2499.56s)]
*  Varsity. That's the name of the operation. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2502.2s)]
*  Oh, it was Varsity Blues. Yeah. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2504.48s)]
*  Also a fantastic film that probably doesn't hold up [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2505.92s)]
*  if we saw it again from when we saw it as kids. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2509.44s)]
*  It didn't for a while. Now it's back. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2511.28s)]
*  Trump won. It's now good again. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2513.32s)]
*  You didn't do the whipped cream bikini. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2514.68s)]
*  Yeah, but it's got to be it's got to be about how this would affect people. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2517.8s)]
*  So that's just that to me is always the the number one like qual. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2521.24s)]
*  And to the extent that people aren't qualified, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2526.96s)]
*  it's that their lack of qualifications is not something that's going to help them [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2529.04s)]
*  like reform an agency to improve people's lives. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2532.56s)]
*  But it's actually going to hurt you. Yeah. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2534.92s)]
*  By having them there. I guess that's right. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2537.04s)]
*  That's that's the broader argument we need to be making, I suppose, to the country. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2539.0s)]
*  If we whether these people get confirmed or not, what is the story [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2542.44s)]
*  we're starting to tell about the Trump era? [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2545.8s)]
*  What is the argument that's going to persuade four Republicans? [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2547.64s)]
*  I think that's separate. No, but it is. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2550.8s)]
*  But that but that's important, too, right? [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2552.16s)]
*  Because these are these are hearings for the country, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2553.72s)]
*  but they are also hearings for Murkowski, for Collins, for Curtis, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2556.12s)]
*  the guy that replaced Mitt Romney that seems to have suddenly discovered. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2560.6s)]
*  It seems I didn't remember his name. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2563.44s)]
*  Romney has some Romney vibes to him. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2565.12s)]
*  Cassidy, these kinds of people. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2567.92s)]
*  Well, that's what I do think making national security arguments [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2569.24s)]
*  is one way to potentially do that, because you do have some. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2572.04s)]
*  You do have a couple of Republican senators who are a little more [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2575.08s)]
*  old school Republican genuinely concerned about these institutions, too, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2578.0s)]
*  and defending our country. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2581.64s)]
*  Also, I think Robert F. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2583.32s)]
*  Kennedy Jr. could have a unique set of problems in that he is pro-choice. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2584.4s)]
*  And there's a bunch of pro-life Republicans who have expressed concern [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2588.48s)]
*  about the pick. I wonder if, you know, that could take him down. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2591.0800000000004s)]
*  We'll see. Yeah. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2593.88s)]
*  Speaking of Democrats deciding whether to fight back, [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2596.0s)]
*  there have been a couple of notable instances lately of Democrats [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2597.88s)]
*  expressing modest support for some of Trump's nominees and initiatives. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2600.6800000000003s)]
*  Colorado Governor Jared Polis [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2604.76s)]
*  tweeted a few weeks ago that he was, quote, excited by R.F.K. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2607.2000000000003s)]
*  Jr.'s appointment because of his stance against big pharma and corporate [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2610.4s)]
*  agriculture, even though he said he doesn't personally agree [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2613.52s)]
*  with his stance on vaccines. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2616.6400000000003s)]
*  And on Sunday, Bernie Sanders tweeted, quote, Elon Musk is right [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2618.44s)]
*  when it comes to criticizing Pentagon spending and waste, [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2621.8s)]
*  prompting favorable replies from Trump allies like Elon and Matt Gates [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2624.92s)]
*  and less favorable replies from several angry liberals on Twitter. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2629.28s)]
*  Favorite kind. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2634.1600000000003s)]
*  What do you guys think about how and whether Democrats should collaborate [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2635.7200000000003s)]
*  with the Trump administration on initiatives where they agree? [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2638.72s)]
*  Yo, R.F.K., let's collab. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2642.2s)]
*  Let's hook up. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2644.56s)]
*  I think Jared Polis screwed up. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2646.68s)]
*  I just sounding too credulous. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2647.9199999999996s)]
*  You know, like I just yes, healthier food sounds great. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2649.6s)]
*  Do we think that R.F.K. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2652.8799999999997s)]
*  is going to succeed at that when he's up against the broader [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2654.0s)]
*  Project 2025 deregulatory agenda where they're gutting [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2657.08s)]
*  environmental protections? I don't think so. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2660.4399999999996s)]
*  I also think R.F.K. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2662.3599999999997s)]
*  Jr. cares mostly about keeping vaccines out of our arms. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2663.16s)]
*  So I think that's going to be the issue there. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2666.84s)]
*  I think the criticism of Bernie, in my opinion, is very stupid. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2668.92s)]
*  I think the Democrats have long wanted to cut the Pentagon budget as they should. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2672.4s)]
*  I think we all should want to cut waste and fraud and abuse, [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2676.16s)]
*  and we should be in support of the goal and then hold their feet to the fire [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2679.32s)]
*  based on whether they're successful or not. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2684.12s)]
*  Can I just say Bernie was doing something there that is substantively [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2686.4s)]
*  and politically smart and good per usual. Right. Like, [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2689.92s)]
*  I actually think the Democrats on this on this Doge thing, like should beat [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2694.08s)]
*  Trump and Elon and all the rest of them to the punch on a reform agenda. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2698.48s)]
*  And we should put forward a list of waste, fraud and abuse in government. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2702.7999999999997s)]
*  It should include corporate subsidies, corporate tax breaks, no bid contracts, [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2706.56s)]
*  any other kind of waste that we can find in government and then, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2712.0s)]
*  you know, present it to all them, see if they do it. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2715.4s)]
*  And if they don't do it, oh, I thought you were a reformer. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2717.24s)]
*  Why aren't you reforming the system? [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2719.04s)]
*  And then criticize Elon and Trump's moves based on who they'd hurt [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2720.4s)]
*  and who they'd rip off. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2725.2000000000003s)]
*  Elon Musk said that we should delete the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2726.48s)]
*  which has saved consumers tens of millions of dollars over the last decade. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2730.7200000000003s)]
*  They're very mad at the CFPB because Marc Andreessen, a crypto billionaire [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2735.0s)]
*  who's invested much, much more in crypto, has decided it's bad [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2739.28s)]
*  because I think some of the people he worked with were, quote unquote, debanked. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2742.84s)]
*  I'm not sure if that's even true because I don't know. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2746.1200000000003s)]
*  They were selling fraudulent or risky assets. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2748.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm not sure what's going on there. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2751.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, they've always had a they've always hated the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2752.8399999999997s)]
*  The reason it's called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2756.7999999999997s)]
*  and not the Consumer Financial Protection Agency is because Republicans [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2759.4399999999996s)]
*  prevented it from becoming an agency. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2762.7999999999997s)]
*  It was originally supposed to be led by Elizabeth Warren, whose idea it was, [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2764.3199999999997s)]
*  but Republicans prevented her from leading the agency. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2766.9599999999996s)]
*  She then ran for the Senate. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2770.08s)]
*  So jokes on them because she stuck around. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2771.24s)]
*  But they've always hated it. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2774.72s)]
*  They've always lied about what it does. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2775.68s)]
*  And what it does is protect consumers at the expense of big banks, [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2777.3999999999996s)]
*  credit card companies, airlines, et cetera. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2782.08s)]
*  And so they've always hated it. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2784.7999999999997s)]
*  We cannot defend things just because Elon Musk or any of these people [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2786.9199999999996s)]
*  say that they're bad. We just can't. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2792.52s)]
*  That just can't be what our politics are. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2793.8799999999997s)]
*  Politics are not going to be defined. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2795.44s)]
*  We have to have our own. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2796.8799999999997s)]
*  We have to have our own politics. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2798.3199999999997s)]
*  And sometimes the the fucking Doge people are going to be right. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2799.68s)]
*  Now, the polis thing bothers me because this idea that you should look past [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2803.36s)]
*  what R.F.K. Junior says on vaccines because you have a problem with [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2809.1600000000003s)]
*  high fructose corn syrup or whatever is to, like, I think, [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2813.4s)]
*  misunderstand the job and like even and Polos walked it back a bit. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2815.52s)]
*  But even in his statement, he's like, I hope R.F.K. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2819.88s)]
*  Junior doesn't withdraw vaccines. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2822.76s)]
*  And so, well, if you're already at the place where you're hoping [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2825.36s)]
*  he doesn't do something that would be deadly and devastating, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2827.44s)]
*  you've given away the game. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2830.44s)]
*  Like, there's like an easy edit to Polos' statement that would have been fine [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2831.36s)]
*  if he said, like, I don't like vaccine mandates, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2835.2000000000003s)]
*  but R.F.K. Junior's views on vaccines are dangerous. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2838.56s)]
*  And I would not have picked him if he is confirmed. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2841.4s)]
*  I hope he'll follow through on his commitment to take on big pharma [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2845.08s)]
*  and corporate agriculture. Right. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2847.88s)]
*  Like that would have been that would not have ruffled a bunch of feathers. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2850.0s)]
*  Like he was bad pick. He shouldn't have started with that bad pick. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2853.6400000000003s)]
*  I don't like him. Vaccine views are crazy. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2856.6400000000003s)]
*  He does have some views on other things that, you know, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2858.7200000000003s)]
*  if we can't stop them, then great. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2860.6s)]
*  Right. Well, he and also back in back in August, Polos had said [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2862.68s)]
*  that R.F.K. Junior's views on vaccines are dangerous [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2866.64s)]
*  and he would be dangerous if he was in charge of health and human services. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2870.0s)]
*  So it was just it was just strange. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2873.52s)]
*  I think he's dealing with some libertarian state politics [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2875.3199999999997s)]
*  and was opposed to vaccine mandates at some point. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2877.72s)]
*  So anyway, but I think the challenge for the Doge folks [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2880.2799999999997s)]
*  is just that the majority of federal spending is mandatory. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2885.24s)]
*  Social Security, it's Medicare, it's Medicaid. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2889.0s)]
*  We pay about a trillion dollars worth of interest on our own debt. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2891.28s)]
*  Then there's a flashback to 2011. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2894.32s)]
*  Yeah. Then there's eight hundred fifty billion in defense spending. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2895.8s)]
*  So finding huge cuts like Elon Musk says, I think you wanted to cut two trillion [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2898.36s)]
*  a year. It's going to be incredibly difficult. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2902.5200000000004s)]
*  Now, good luck trying. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2904.6800000000003s)]
*  But once you when you're talking about those levels of cuts, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2906.0800000000004s)]
*  you're going to start really, really hurting people in service of extending [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2909.32s)]
*  the Trump tax cuts for the richest people in the country. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2913.4s)]
*  And that's the story we have to tell. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2916.1200000000003s)]
*  This is also like a very old game that Republicans have played for a long time, [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2917.68s)]
*  which is you find some ridiculous sounding spending in the federal government, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2921.96s)]
*  of which there is a lot and a line item somewhere that sounds fucking nuts. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2927.52s)]
*  Or you point to employees who seem like they shouldn't be there. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2932.72s)]
*  Elon Musk is like putting federal employees on blast tweeting about them [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2937.64s)]
*  to try to fire them. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2941.48s)]
*  But, you know, even if you even if you eliminated [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2943.52s)]
*  every federal employee in the entire government, that's like a tiny percentage [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2946.28s)]
*  of the overall budget. It's not spent on staffers. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2950.88s)]
*  It's spent on payments to people. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2953.0800000000004s)]
*  It's a tiny portion of discretionary spending. Yes. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2954.76s)]
*  There was the Republican study group, which is 170 members of the House [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2957.2400000000002s)]
*  and all the Republican leadership. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2960.6000000000004s)]
*  They put out a budget earlier this year and it calls called for raising [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2961.52s)]
*  the Social Security retirement age, which is just a giant cut to Social Security [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2966.36s)]
*  because the age is really just a means of deciding how much money you get. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2970.52s)]
*  There was a story just the other day that like if they're going to want to [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2975.68s)]
*  pay for all of these Trump tax cuts, what are they going to do to pay for it? [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2979.56s)]
*  Well, they want to they want to mean test food stamps. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2983.2799999999997s)]
*  Joe Biden, who were obviously in a bad mood with this week, [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2986.24s)]
*  he personally increased this weekend for many months. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2991.4s)]
*  But like he didn't get a lot of credit for this, didn't get a lot of attention. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2995.84s)]
*  But he basically there was a bipartisan bill that gave the president [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=2998.16s)]
*  the authority to increase food stamps. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=3001.7599999999998s)]
*  And so he issued the largest increase in food stamps [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=3003.72s)]
*  that any president has ever done permanently. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=3007.0s)]
*  And he increased them by thirty six dollars per month. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=3009.48s)]
*  Month amounts of about four hundred dollars a year. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=3011.64s)]
*  Not a lot of money. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=3014.72s)]
*  Republicans have already started talking about that in order to pay [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=3015.9599999999996s)]
*  for the extension of the Trump tax cuts. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=3018.8399999999997s)]
*  They want to revoke the president's authority to increase food stamps [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=3020.4399999999996s)]
*  for by a few hundred dollars so that they can cut a person making five [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=3024.4399999999996s)]
*  million dollars a year, cut their taxes by 200 grand. Right. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=3028.3599999999997s)]
*  That's what they want to do. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=3031.08s)]
*  And you'll have the vague. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=3032.12s)]
*  You'll have Elon running around the country talking about expensive [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=3033.12s)]
*  office chairs and silly sounding science projects. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=3036.68s)]
*  But that's where the real cuts are going to be. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=3039.24s)]
*  They're going to start by going after food stamps and Medicaid [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=3040.7599999999998s)]
*  because they start by going after poor people in the working poor [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=3043.52s)]
*  and slowly work their way up to Social Security. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=3045.88s)]
*  So John McCain's whole schtick, the bridge to nowhere, pork barrel spending. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=3047.7999999999997s)]
*  This isn't new. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=3052.24s)]
*  And then that guy died in a plane crash. Follow the money. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=3053.2s)]
*  Not John McCain. No, I know. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=3055.72s)]
*  I know. Ted Stevens, Ted Stevens. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=3057.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. You just call him a doge because it's crypto. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=3059.0s)]
*  We're back at Simpson Bowles now. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=3062.7599999999998s)]
*  So all right, before we go. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=3064.0s)]
*  Remember Cheryl Hines? [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=3067.72s)]
*  Yes. The first lady of HHS. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL6nFpqv-A&t=3068.96s)]
