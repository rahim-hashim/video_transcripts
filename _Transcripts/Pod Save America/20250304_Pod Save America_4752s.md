Video Description: The fallout continues from Friday's trainwreck of an Oval Office meeting between Trump, JD Vance, and Volodymyr Zelensky. Jon, Lovett, and Tommy break down whether things have improved or spiraled further since Friday's meeting—and whether we're witnessing the collapse of the postwar order. Plus, Trump vows that his tariffs on Mexico and Canada will go into effect, Elon Musk calls Social Security a "Ponzi scheme," and the White House announces a "Crypto Strategic Reserve" to stockpile five cryptocurrencies. Hmm, could it possibly be grift?

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Emotional Trump and Vance Lose Composure In Disastrous Ukraine War Meeting with Zelenskyy
**Pod Save America:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98)
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Jon Favreau. I'm Jon Lovett. Tommy Vitor. On today's show [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=0.0s)]
*  We got Elon Musk calling Social Security a Ponzi scheme on Joe Rogan the same weekend Donald Trump announces [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4.64s)]
*  He wants to spend our tax dollars on a strategic crypto reserve, which is definitely not a Ponzi scheme [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=10.86s)]
*  No [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=16.88s)]
*  We also got new tariffs coming. Woohoo [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=17.7s)]
*  Just as a bunch of new polls show that people actually don't think Trump's doing a great job bringing down inflation [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=20.16s)]
*  And then as Donald Trump prepares to give his big speech to Congress Tuesday night [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=25.2s)]
*  We'll talk about the new debate on the left about how Democrats should be pushing on Trump and whether they should be pushing back at all [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=28.86s)]
*  But first guys we got to talk about the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=36.34s)]
*  Absolute shit show of an Oval Office meeting on Friday where Trump and JD Vance ganged up on Ukrainian President [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=40.22s)]
*  Vladimir Zelensky an ally whose country has been fighting off an invasion by Vladimir Putin a brutal dictator who used to be our adversary [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=46.260000000000005s)]
*  Hopefully you all got a chance to hear the bonus episode Tommy and Ben did about this over the weekend [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=54.94s)]
*  A lot has happened since then [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=60.78s)]
*  After Zelensky was basically kicked out of the White House because JD Vance didn't think he was sufficiently grateful for US support didn't say [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=62.78s)]
*  Thank you enough [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=69.26s)]
*  Zelensky flew to London to meet with European leaders about negotiating a peace process that doesn't entail just giving Putin everything he wants [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=70.38s)]
*  Meanwhile the Russians could not be happier [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=78.34s)]
*  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Sunday that the Trump administration is quote [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=81.22s)]
*  rapidly changing all foreign policy configurations this largely aligns with our vision [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=86.14s)]
*  Hard to argue with that after Axios reported that Trump was set to hold a meeting with JD Vance Marco Rubio and national security advisor Mike Walz to talk about the idea of [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=92.26s)]
*  Cutting off American aid to Ukraine altogether [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=99.7s)]
*  Walz told Fox News quote the American people's patience is not unlimited their wallets are not unlimited and our stockpiles are not unlimited [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=103.38s)]
*  And our stockpiles and munitions are not unlimited if you're wondering how Republicans are feeling about all this especially [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=110.05999999999999s)]
*  Previously pro-Ukraine Republicans [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=117.13999999999999s)]
*  Here's a sample of their reaction to Friday's blow up millions of American hearts [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=119.5s)]
*  Swell with overflowing pride today to watch President Trump put Zelensky in his place [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=124.13999999999999s)]
*  Instead of showing gratitude he interrupted and berated his hosts am I embarrassed about Trump? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=132.01999999999998s)]
*  I have never been more proud of the president. I was very proud of JD Vance [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=137.57999999999998s)]
*  It's gonna be Putin and the president Trump in and the people on our side that will end up making this decision for the future [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=142.22s)]
*  Of Ukraine, but this is one of the great moments in the history of American diplomacy [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=149.34s)]
*  Jesus these that was that start and end with Stephen Miller. I think we know it's swell during that meeting [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=153.57999999999998s)]
*  He's real housewife fucking Luanne wasn't grateful enough for the invitation [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=160.18s)]
*  Also Donald Trump didn't give Ukraine really any aid and JD Vance voted against the the supplemental spending bill for Ukraine aid [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=166.5s)]
*  So who are we thinking exactly? I love Tommy Tuberville there [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=173.1s)]
*  I'm assuming that was him who said who said yeah, it's gonna be Trump Putin and everyone on our side deciding [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=176.01999999999998s)]
*  It's like what what are we our side? So Tommy now that you've had more time to process what happened on Friday [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=181.85999999999999s)]
*  Do you have any other thoughts on the fallout and whether things have gotten better or worse since then? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=187.18s)]
*  Yeah, so I think the in terms of Zelensky's efforts to get more support from the US or get some sort of security deal [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=192.56s)]
*  You just mentioned a way where it got worse in the near term because it sounds like they're freezing an additional [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=198.14s)]
*  They're freezing. It's more money that could be transferred over to Ukraine in terms of weapons stockpiles [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=204.56s)]
*  But the bigger picture problem that that Zelensky has is that Trump and JD Vance just want a deal and they don't care about [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=209.28s)]
*  The substance of the deal [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=216.56s)]
*  They don't care if the Russians end up occupying 20% of Ukrainian territory or if Ukraine is told that they can't have a real [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=217.67999999999998s)]
*  Armed forces going forward. So there's just kind of a sitting duck sitting there like Trump just wants a win in the Western press [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=225.01999999999998s)]
*  now from Europe's perspective [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=231.92s)]
*  I think maybe the meeting was clarifying and maybe that could help Zelensky because you know now there's all these reports that France and [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=234.04s)]
*  The UK are trying to pull together a European peacekeeping group that will give Zelensky a security guarantee [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=240.67999999999998s)]
*  After there is a peace deal and that's what he really wants [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=246.64000000000001s)]
*  so I think like the challenge going that into that meeting now that I thought about it more is the US media tends to forget that [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=249.64000000000001s)]
*  All these foreign leaders who come in have their own political considerations and for Zelensky like that meeting going really badly and getting in [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=257.8s)]
*  A fight was not good [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  But a worse outcome for him would have been getting bullied into taking a ceasefire deal that leaves them vulnerable going forward [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=265.8s)]
*  When Putin decides to break a ceasefire agreement that he cuts just to kind of make Trump happy and so it's a bit of a mixed bag [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=273.32000000000005s)]
*  I don't know [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=280.36s)]
*  The hopeful version is maybe the Europeans will get their shit together finally and give Ukraine what they need [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=281.56s)]
*  Love it. What was your take on the meeting? There's been a lot of speculation that [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=286.32000000000005s)]
*  Trump and Vance plan to ambush Zelensky Maggie Haberman and other journalists who covered the White House are reporting that the Trump people [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=290.92s)]
*  Are saying it was spontaneous. What do you think? I have no idea [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  Like part of this is just like none of this makes sense, right? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=302.16s)]
*  Like none of the none of like what they're saying aligns with what they're actually doing, right? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  Like I'm trying to like separate [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=309.0s)]
*  Like the meeting is disgusting right? Like this is fucking disgusting. This is a guy flying from a war-torn country [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=310.84000000000003s)]
*  He basically saved his country in part by like sheer force of personality and personal bravery [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=316.36s)]
*  He flies across the world to United States our ally up until three months ago [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=321.64s)]
*  Now he's trying to grovel for his country's life to sign a mineral deal that also doesn't make any sense [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=326.22s)]
*  That doesn't include any security guarantees. He's agreeing to do it because just trying to get through another day with Donald Trump and JD Vance [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=331.54s)]
*  He's sitting there. He's getting questions about why he's not wearing a fucking suit [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=337.94000000000005s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene's boyfriend. She Trump apparently said to the press corps. Oh, he's got dressed up today [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=342.3s)]
*  Yeah, just talking that was before that was before the meeting. He's an awakening [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=346.66s)]
*  nightmare like [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=351.42s)]
*  The question I have is okay [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=353.78000000000003s)]
*  Let's say all this played out behind the scenes right like not in front of the cameras like take away the aesthetics of it [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=355.02000000000004s)]
*  It's like, you know in the morning [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=360.1s)]
*  Marco Rubio thought signing this mineral deal and ostensibly becoming more entwined with a you with Ukraine was a good idea by the afternoon [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=362.46000000000004s)]
*  It's no longer a good idea and everything Trump is doing is making sense [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=369.18s)]
*  There's all these like post hoc rationalizations for Donald Trump [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=372.56s)]
*  Like even in the days that have followed like you go like try to read about this meeting and it's people saying is Trump [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=376.02000000000004s)]
*  Abandoning the World War two order for spheres of influence like no [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=381.42s)]
*  He's just a careening asshole and there's this whole intellectual framework like evolving around him to justify [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=385.40000000000003s)]
*  What he's saying like even Vance in the meeting [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=391.1s)]
*  He says we tried the pathway of Joe Biden of thumping our chest and pretending that the president of the United States is words [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=393.46000000000004s)]
*  matter more than the president of the United States is actions and [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=398.86s)]
*  So therefore we're capitulating completely in our actions, right? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=402.58000000000004s)]
*  Why does what follow what follows from there a kind of diplomacy in which the aggressor is ignored, right? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=406.42s)]
*  Like let's say they do want peace. They do want to deal at all costs [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=412.5s)]
*  Wouldn't that involve putting pressure on Vladimir Putin as well? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=415.1s)]
*  Where is that like you can't really make any sense around this because it's a bunch of people [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=417.7s)]
*  Acting emotionally trying to rationalize Donald Trump's various like ego driven grievance driven assumption driven foreign policy [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=422.86s)]
*  And so what we end up like having these serious conversations about these like fundamentally despicable and unserious people [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=430.22s)]
*  That was my reaction [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=435.70000000000005s)]
*  Yeah [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=437.46000000000004s)]
*  Like I don't think it was an ambush or planned [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=438.82000000000005s)]
*  I think what was planned is both Trump and JD Vance [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=441.74s)]
*  Don't like or respect so inskey that much because as Tommy said they just wanted to get a deal and there I think they [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=445.54s)]
*  Are just annoyed at the whole situation that they have to like go through all the motions here and they have to deal with him [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=451.42s)]
*  And treat him like he's an ally right or that like he's an equal partner or even a partner at all [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=457.06s)]
*  Like I don't know if you get I'm sure you guys did this [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=463.26s)]
*  I'm sure you did this on me like I went back to the transcript and read it like so many times to see where it [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=465.66s)]
*  Went off the rails. Yep, because it all like it was going fine [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=469.66s)]
*  And then it was it times a little bit chummy even little yes [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=472.66s)]
*  They're joking about their [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=475.86s)]
*  Europe and it starts the bad part starts with a reporter asking Trump if he's too aligned with Putin which is obviously a trigger for him [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=477.42s)]
*  Right, like that's that's just gonna set Trump off and like that couldn't be pre-planned, right? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=485.02s)]
*  And then Trump says oh [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=489.16s)]
*  You see the hatred he's got for Putin pointing to Zelensky [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=491.52s)]
*  It's very tough for me to make a deal with that kind of hate. He's got tremendous hatred [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=494.86s)]
*  So like we start the meeting by Trump scolding the guy [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=498.76s)]
*  Keep in mind scolding the guy that he had just called a dictator twice over the past couple weeks [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=502.28s)]
*  We're like complaining about Zelensky not saying thank you and Trump has called this guy a dictator twice [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=507.68s)]
*  So we then he scolds him while he's sitting right there in the Oval Office for having too much hatred to do the deal [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=511.56s)]
*  But then even Trump sort of like, you know, he's like I just want to get a deal. I'm aligned with Europe [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=516.4399999999999s)]
*  I just want to get something done. I guess I'm and the whole thing probably would have gone away [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=521.04s)]
*  Then if fucking JD Vance didn't jump in after Trump finished his answer. He was the chief arsonist [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=523.72s)]
*  No one asked JD Vance for a follow-up answer on that JD Vance just jumped in after Trump win and did this whole thing [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=529.0s)]
*  Where you said where he also just gets the whole time laying around [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=534.56s)]
*  He's like Putin invaded Ukraine after Joe Biden like just tried to talk tough and didn't engage in diplomacy [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=536.9399999999999s)]
*  So Zelensky's like well, that's not the timeline [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=543.72s)]
*  He's basically like yeah [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=546.72s)]
*  well [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=547.84s)]
*  he's been trying to invade the country and he's been like at war with us since 2014 and [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=548.0s)]
*  Then he also throws in by the way during the first answer and God bless now President Trump will stop him [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=552.84s)]
*  Right, which was also nice. I'd say like I respect Maggie's reporting [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=558.9399999999999s)]
*  But there were at times where I felt like the headline was like this wasn't an ambush and then the substance the story didn't back [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=563.04s)]
*  That up for example, Lindsey Graham is running around telling everyone that he told Zelensky not to take Trump's bait [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=568.28s)]
*  Well, if this wasn't a setup then why would he be baited in the first place and maybe that's an overly literal meeting [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=573.4s)]
*  But like Trump's position is you have to come into the Oval Office [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=579.68s)]
*  You have to bow to my will you cannot disagree with me even about points of fact [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=582.3199999999999s)]
*  And that's just not tenable for the leader of a country fighting for its existence [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=586.3199999999999s)]
*  And so like ambush not an ambush. It was designed for [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=590.36s)]
*  domestic political consumption like JD Vance's speech was his chance to finally talk in a big boy meeting and lead the headlines [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=594.24s)]
*  41 days into the administration or Elon had been in ahead of him every other day and then Trump at the end says [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=602.9200000000001s)]
*  Well, I think it was good for the American people to hear all that and this will make for good TV [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=610.48s)]
*  And if you want to make this all a private discussion about the substance don't have the fucking pool spray in there for 45 minutes [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=614.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there's there's one moment where? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=620.0400000000001s)]
*  Where is a lint ski calls him JD and then JD calls him. Mr. President. And so like you feel like it's quite personal but like [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=622.6s)]
*  None of this should be personal right like it's not just about Trump calling him a dictator the the United States [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=630.96s)]
*  sided with Putin [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=638.12s)]
*  La a week earlier at the UN like these are supposed to be [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=639.72s)]
*  It's all like Vance and even Rubio like you go look up [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=644.72s)]
*  We'll talk about Rubio more in a minute [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=648.4000000000001s)]
*  But like these guys were all like the end of America's namby pamby soft emotional foreign policy is over [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=649.76s)]
*  We're doing hard-nosed decisions based on pure rationality and it's like if that's the case a fit of peak in a meeting shouldn't matter [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=656.12s)]
*  Well, it shouldn't matter at all. It's all there. They are allowing this to be 100% personality driven [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=663.8000000000001s)]
*  I like that. I like David Zanger's piece on this which is [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=669.44s)]
*  He's basically arguing that the overall goal here is the Trump wants to normalize relations with Russia and [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=673.4000000000001s)]
*  Ukraine is standing in the way of that so linsky standing in the way of that [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=680.0s)]
*  So with that larger context any meeting was it like it could have gone better in terms of the theatrics of it [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=682.72s)]
*  but like it was always gonna be trumping like this guy is an [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=688.6800000000001s)]
*  Impediment to normalization with Russia, which is what I want. It's like why do we want to normalize things Russia so much? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=692.32s)]
*  It's like a it's a it's a broken economy. It's like a wartime economy [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=697.26s)]
*  Now they just make artillery shells that they use to kill Ukrainians [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=700.86s)]
*  But once sort of under discussed bizarre part of Trump's rant [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=703.5600000000001s)]
*  You see, you know [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=707.24s)]
*  You also have to think about the original impeachment and has the linsky was involved right because Trump called Zelensky and was trying to [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=708.04s)]
*  Held up military into Ukraine in order to get dirt on Joe Biden [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=713.84s)]
*  But an under discuss or part of when Trump gets really mad is he starts ranting about the Mueller investigation? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=717.0s)]
*  Yeah, and he says Putin went through a hell of a lot with me [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=722.72s)]
*  And then he said it came out of hunter Biden's bathroom like so none of this may sense [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=725.88s)]
*  But he was talking about how like he and Vlad endured something terrible together [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=730.96s)]
*  Like somehow it was bad for Putin to have been perceived by the world as having handpicked the American president like their blood brothers [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=736.6s)]
*  It's actually really really strange. It's kind of like a Stockholm syndrome [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=743.16s)]
*  It's like you're saying like why would the US want to normalize relations with Russia? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=746.88s)]
*  And again, this is why like this is none of this makes sense and like all these sort of pathetic weasels around from trying to [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=751.08s)]
*  Make it make sense are obviously part of the problem. It's like no, of course not. It's a fail failing petro state [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=756.52s)]
*  Well, right that it's like been depleted. It's like [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=762.24s)]
*  America it's so fucking pathetic that because of Donald Trump as a figure a singular figure [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=764.88s)]
*  We're now becoming a vassal state of this tiny weak country [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=770.82s)]
*  Because like Donald Trump has these ego driven like [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=775.08s)]
*  Psychosexual personal issues with this one dictator who on his bones [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=778.64s)]
*  He knows is so much tougher than him by the way Zelensky to write like part of this resentment [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=783.08s)]
*  Is that JD Vance and Donald Trump know that like this? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=786.6s)]
*  Zelensky is a stronger and tougher man than they are and you can just feel the seething kind of like [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=789.28s)]
*  Weakness of these two human beings in front of this actual leader [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=794.92s)]
*  He also when he gets mad when Trump gets mad [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=799.0s)]
*  He just has like conspiracy Tourette's and he just like goes through the that's where that's where that came from [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=801.8199999999999s)]
*  like where he just went down the road of like [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=806.6s)]
*  Putin Russia gate hunter laptop bathroom video. Yeah, he's just he doesn't know at that point [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=809.3199999999999s)]
*  He always got you the this was the what do you always call the FBI people that were sleeping together trucks trucking [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=817.0s)]
*  Love yellow the lovers. Yeah, I was got to the lover page and yeah [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=822.16s)]
*  Mention Adam Schiff and sir do you know it was on hunters laptop? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=827.0799999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of photos that you probably don't want to yeah, you gave there were a few incursions on there [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=830.3199999999999s)]
*  But I don't think it had anything to do with what we're talking about five more seconds. He would have gone there [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=834.54s)]
*  He would have gone there. Let's talk about Secretary of State little Marco Rubio for a minute who looked [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=837.5799999999999s)]
*  Not excited to be in that meeting [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=842.64s)]
*  As a reminder, here's an example of what Rubio used to say on Ukraine and what he's saying now [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=845.04s)]
*  Look, Putin can't win no matter what there always has to be a real [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=849.34s)]
*  Legitimate Ukrainian state that we have a relationship with and I don't know why we can't begin to openly say [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=852.84s)]
*  We will support them as long as they are willing to fight even if it's an insurgency [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=857.6999999999999s)]
*  thoughts on Rubio [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=862.3199999999999s)]
*  I've noticed this in all of the photos of Rubio in the context of these US Russia talks [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=864.68s)]
*  Like there were a bunch of photos that came out of Saudi Arabia with his like Rubio Mike Walt's [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=868.72s)]
*  Steve Witkoff were all there and there's like Sergei Lavrov and the Russian delegation [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=872.8000000000001s)]
*  Rubio just has this thousand-yard stare and all of them and it like I don't want to you know, put him on the [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=876.84s)]
*  Psychiatrist couch, but I do think like you can tell he knows this is wrong because I do think it's fair to say [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=883.2s)]
*  Okay, after three years of the Biden policy [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=889.16s)]
*  we got to a place where it was a permanent stalemate kind of and a stalemate is not a strategy and [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=891.7s)]
*  So let's not re-emphasize diplomacy and try to end the war but Rubio knows Zelensky's not a dictator and Putin is [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=898.14s)]
*  He knows who started the war and who didn't he knows that Zelensky can't hold an election right now [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=904.06s)]
*  Because a huge chunk of the country is living under Russian occupation. Another big chunk has been displaced [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=909.3s)]
*  Another big chunk is that the front lines fighting? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=914.34s)]
*  Well, how are they gonna have people vote in free and fair elections in this context? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=916.46s)]
*  and so he just looks like a guy who sold out all his beliefs to get the Secretary of State job and now is like [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=920.82s)]
*  Living with the consequences and by the way has no real power. Well, and that's what he that's what he looks like in all these pictures [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=927.58s)]
*  He does sound like he's trying to sell this new [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=932.58s)]
*  This new marker Rubio and how he thinks I think we have a clip of him [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=936.54s)]
*  What he says now what specifically do you want to see President Zelensky apologize for? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=940.06s)]
*  Well apologize for turning this thing into the fiasco for him that it became [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=945.74s)]
*  He found every opportunity to try to Ukraine's plane on every issue. Maybe Zelensky doesn't want a peace deal [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=949.54s)]
*  He says he does but maybe he doesn't Ukraine's plane it the Ukraine split like again [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=955.44s)]
*  It's like it it's so it's so emotional right? Like oh, he he should have been more [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=960.84s)]
*  He should have shown better manners this fucking Emily Post [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=965.12s)]
*  Bullshit, I went back and looked at Rubio's [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=969.0600000000001s)]
*  The the the Senate confirmation speech that he gave when he says the post war global order is not just obsolete [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=973.1600000000001s)]
*  It's now a weapon being used against us, right? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=978.72s)]
*  And like this is him again like trying to find a way to make sense of his involvement, right? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=981.3000000000001s)]
*  and like I do think that like [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=985.98s)]
*  There is a critique of the way in which the Biden administration is like didn't want to lose but didn't want to win in a bunch [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=987.98s)]
*  Of different ways all around the world by the way like for decades about like an America [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=993.4200000000001s)]
*  They're just slowly watching China grow more and more powerful as we welcome them into the economic order [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=997.6600000000001s)]
*  Which are things that he talks about right? But like the other side of that is meant to be a stronger [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1002.48s)]
*  US right like a more like like a more full-throated less morally relativistic defense of our values of our principles, right? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1008.0999999999999s)]
*  Like some kind of a strategy but but then you like you look at what's happening. It's like we're capitulating [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1014.9799999999999s)]
*  To Russia and they're like well actually it's because you know, we we're not gonna worry about what's happening over there [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1020.06s)]
*  We're gonna worry about happening in our own backyard. Okay, but we're also basically [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1024.46s)]
*  threatening with [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1028.7s)]
*  threatening Canada with invasion [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1029.74s)]
*  Threatening Panama with invasion throwing tariffs on our neighbors like there's no logic to any of this and Rubio [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1031.22s)]
*  Because he's just the fucking world's biggest weasel [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1037.0s)]
*  It's just trying to figure out what he can say day to day just to just say get him into a I guess a bet [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1040.2s)]
*  So I kind of think that there might be a logic to it [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1046.36s)]
*  Can I give you my shirt like I think that Trump and that look? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1050.12s)]
*  I don't think this is like he has Trump has planned out everything and has been really [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1053.6399999999999s)]
*  Thinking deep about this and writing it in his memoirs, you know, I think he he respects rich powerful [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1059.12s)]
*  ruthless leaders and [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1065.94s)]
*  It seems like he wants to carve up the world [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1067.7s)]
*  With Putin and she and maybe you got your Kim Jong-un's in there your BBs anyone with nuclear weapons, right? [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1072.06s)]
*  he knows that if you have nuclear weapons, then you're you're pretty powerful and [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1078.3799999999999s)]
*  He knows they're bad guys. He knows they treat their people horribly. He doesn't really care about that [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1082.02s)]
*  He likes the idea that he can deal with a few what he views as tough leaders directly [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1086.9s)]
*  He thinks he's a great negotiator [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1093.68s)]
*  he doesn't like the idea of the UN and NATO and places where you have all these voices in some [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1095.48s)]
*  countries that he doesn't think should have a seat at the table an equal seat at the table with everyone else because they're weaker than [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1102.32s)]
*  the other countries because that's too democratic and he doesn't like democracy that much and [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1107.32s)]
*  The idea of him this is like when he always brags when like she came to Mar-a-Lago [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1112.28s)]
*  And you know, and then he gets to one dine-in and impress him and you know [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1117.16s)]
*  I'm good with Putin and Kim Jong-un likes me like he I think he loves a world where he can deal with a few tough bad guys [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1120.5s)]
*  He's a good negotiator and he looks at and they do all want like client states [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1127.3400000000001s)]
*  He's he's like Putin Putin wants Ukraine Putin may want Western Europe Eastern Europe [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1132.2s)]
*  He sees she wants Taiwan and he's like, well, I better get some client states of my own. Maybe I'll go after Canada [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1136.54s)]
*  Maybe I'll go up to Panama Greenland like it feels like that's his that's his vision of the world [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1141.54s)]
*  I was trying to find this Elon Musk tweet and I was scrolling for like 25 minutes because god all he does is tweet [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1146.9s)]
*  But he tweeted the Lensky wants a forever war a never-ending graft meat grinder [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1152.56s)]
*  This is evil like the way they talk about this guy. These are the Lensky's people getting killed [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1156.64s)]
*  Yeah, the Russians tried to murder him [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1161.74s)]
*  Repeatedly in the early days of the war they sent assassination teams [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1164.94s)]
*  He's a key to find the guy and he survived through bravery through, you know, really tough fighting [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1167.52s)]
*  By the Ukrainians in those early days and it's just disgusting the way they talk about him [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1173.1s)]
*  but to your point John, I mean like I [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1177.04s)]
*  Think there's some truth that like between 50 and 85 million people died in the Second World War [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1179.42s)]
*  So the United States was like or the world came together was like hey [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1183.08s)]
*  Maybe we should set up some institutions to prevent this from happening again. That's why you have the UN [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1185.7s)]
*  That that was designed to try to maintain global peace that led to the creation of NATO [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1190.58s)]
*  Which was to counter Soviet expansion and you know unchecked nationalism [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1195.34s)]
*  Among some of the member states like Germany and [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1200.22s)]
*  You do and both institutions have a lot of flaws and we can talk about those if you want [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1204.98s)]
*  But there hasn't been a war between a NATO member and Russia since [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1209.26s)]
*  And no NATO member has been invaded by another country [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1213.26s)]
*  So it's been a pretty successful project and I agree it does seem like Trump wants to go back to a time where the great [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1216.1000000000001s)]
*  powers divide the world up and they bully people and might is right and [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1221.94s)]
*  I think the problem with that [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1225.6200000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of problems logic, but what you're gonna see is more militarism [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1227.7399999999998s)]
*  You're gonna see more nationalism [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1232.7399999999998s)]
*  You're gonna see more development of nuclear weapons [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1234.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah deterrent because of the US nuclear umbrella is not gonna protect us like this is time to make one of my own [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1237.54s)]
*  And so it's gangster diplomacy and you're already seeing you on must tweeting about I talked about the spoils of battle when he's talking about [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1242.1399999999999s)]
*  Doge cuts, but I think he's applying that more broadly and like a really kind of you know [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1249.1s)]
*  Old-school in a bad way way [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1255.06s)]
*  Trump operates [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1258.1s)]
*  Domestically, this is how Trump has operated in business his whole life, right? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1259.94s)]
*  like it doesn't you don't have to have some grand theory of [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1263.34s)]
*  International order to just view the world as he does as like there's people I think are tough and powerful and there's people [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1266.22s)]
*  I think are weak and why should I give a shit about the weak people? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1273.54s)]
*  I think what you were describing is like the end result of what happens when someone like Trump is just sort of emotionally [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1275.66s)]
*  Instinctively driven towards [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1282.2800000000002s)]
*  relationships with Russia and Putin with with she that he like finds that easier and less of less of a headache but like [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1285.44s)]
*  The where the iPhones from [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1295.4s)]
*  You know like where the chips from like all of this is like the idea is like oh [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1297.5600000000002s)]
*  You're just gonna carve up the world there's stuff moving across those lines already right like the amount of chaos [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1301.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, he's gonna be like yeah, I can I can deal with you directly. I'll keep the iPhones coming. Yeah, sure [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1306.66s)]
*  Oh, I realize it's bullshit, but I think he believes it [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1310.92s)]
*  I think he hasn't worse I think that it's a JD Vance view like I don't think it's just Trump [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1313.96s)]
*  I actually think he now has in Elon and JD Vance in [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1319.18s)]
*  Like I think he has a movement of people around him and they're all they you know [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1323.52s)]
*  They look to Orban they look to Hungary and they're like this is the way I think they look [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1326.76s)]
*  I think they see I mean just take them out their word like the UN [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1330.8s)]
*  World trade organization like these are [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1334.96s)]
*  Institutions that have become sclerotic the same way they and and they don't see the benefits of or or [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1337.6399999999999s)]
*  live in the kind of glib luxury of the security and stability these institutions provide while attacking what our genuine excesses and problems of [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1342.8s)]
*  Working within those organizations and rather than doing the hard grinding work of reforming them [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1350.3999999999999s)]
*  They want to burn them down, but we will live in the indicate dangerous [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1354.86s)]
*  kind of poor world that results when they're long gone and [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1359.7199999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump doesn't know better but market Marco Rubio knows better because he used to know he used to say it out loud [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1364.1200000000001s)]
*  Oh for sure what one even just even simpler explanation is Trump looks at a Russia or China and Z's a kleptocracy [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1368.88s)]
*  And there are people who think that Vladimir Putin's the richest person in the world [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1374.8400000000001s)]
*  Because basically at one point along the way he went to all the Russian oligarchs and says now you give me half [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1378.4s)]
*  Or else you're falling out a very high window [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1383.0800000000002s)]
*  And you but is he happy you can imagine a version of that where you know the the state functions [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1386.0s)]
*  As just another means for Donald Trump to get paid and we're already seeing some pieces of that and again he think yeah [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1393.52s)]
*  I completely agree and in his mind [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1399.1000000000001s)]
*  It's like and I deserve that because I'm the one running everything and and I got my other rich friend Putin over here my other [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1401.52s)]
*  Rich friend she and they're tough guys to look at tough [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1407.76s)]
*  How many times are you talking about tough there? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1410.0400000000002s)]
*  But sometimes the way that I think the left has framed it is oh that the Donald Trump is like a supplicant to these guys [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1411.92s)]
*  Or he's like a stooge for them and like that I think Putin and she probably think that about Trump [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1418.28s)]
*  But I think Trump thinks there is buddies. They're all a bunch of tough guys, you know [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1423.88s)]
*  Standing and straight across the globe together. Yeah, this is why it's like look I [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1429.1200000000001s)]
*  You know the US sides with Russia [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1434.68s)]
*  At the UN against our ally and like how many people in the US actually know about that? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1438.16s)]
*  And how many people in the US actually care about that and by the way [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1444.38s)]
*  notable that that Orban and Bibi joined to in the new club there in the end that vote but I do think like some of [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1447.8600000000001s)]
*  This is like [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1455.2600000000002s)]
*  You know, I was thinking about this for a record it. It's like [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1456.5s)]
*  you know the the democratic legitimacy of these institutions right like were in the post-world war two era came from Americans having a [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1460.38s)]
*  Fear of the Soviet Union drilled into them by propaganda [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1469.18s)]
*  But also the actual threat posed by the Soviet Union that people lived with [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1471.74s)]
*  Every day and then the Cold War ends and we kind of just continue with these institutions [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1475.66s)]
*  Never really making a kind of coherent argument for them why they're important why we're doing this why we spend this money, right? [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1480.1s)]
*  Look, I kind of we were resting on the kind of [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1486.22s)]
*  Goodwill and legitimacy that came from generations before and now Trump puts these things under attack and in the same way [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1489.86s)]
*  We're told it's a trap to talk about why USAID is a good thing [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1495.9199999999998s)]
*  we're now once again in the trap of trying to defend this order because it seems like [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1499.52s)]
*  What what Trump and these guys are daring us to do is say, alright fine burn it down [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1504.48s)]
*  We'll prove you right when everything is terrible. Yeah [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1508.54s)]
*  Works out in this out in the streets chanting rules based order rules based order [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1511.56s)]
*  Yeah, I bet no one knows about the UN vote [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1516.24s)]
*  I mean look the UN Security Council has been broken for a long time because the Russians and Chinese veto whatever they want and we veto [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1518.04s)]
*  Any criticism Israel and nothing gets done, right? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1523.92s)]
*  It's been that way for a decade plus a UN General Assembly vote is basically just kind of like a show of hands of what you believe [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1526.0s)]
*  It's like a global roll call and boy did we show our hand in a new and scary way to the world [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1531.8000000000002s)]
*  I do wonder if the Zelensky Trump meeting will break through and [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1536.96s)]
*  We I don't know hit people differently like I [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1542.1200000000001s)]
*  They did say Slava Ukraine at the Oscars [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1545.8400000000001s)]
*  But [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1547.84s)]
*  Bullying a man who's like trying to rescue [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1551.36s)]
*  19,000 Ukrainian children who were stolen kidnapped and taken to Russia like I don't know that's that's pretty fucked up. That's dark stuff [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1553.6399999999999s)]
*  I'm sure Maga base thought it was awesome, right? Of course, we know that they've been saying that I agree Tommy [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1560.28s)]
*  Like I think I had some people text me who look or not, you know [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1566.04s)]
*  Political junkies like us and are just like that was so embarrassing awful scary. What the fuck is happening? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1569.8799999999999s)]
*  It's like a three-on-one fight and it's not about sending weapons or spending more money [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1575.68s)]
*  It's just about like treating a man with decency whose country has been massacred [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1579.48s)]

*  Social Security is the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time. It seems like the task of making the 2026 campaign ads just got easier [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1806.28s)]
*  It's also just like Social Security is a Ponzi scheme. It's just like late mid like mid 90s Republican talking points [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1813.44s)]
*  It's like where we're at like it's actually a Ponzi scheme. The the trust fund runs out in 2050 trust funds always running out [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1820.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know I'm sort of like always seems like partly aware of it on board with the Trump policy agenda [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1826.72s)]
*  Like no one in the White House wants him to call Social Security [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1831.32s)]
*  Because boy does it then go it's hard to pivot from that to fighting for a five trillion dollar tax cut for the richest people [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1834.88s)]
*  In the country, which is their primary objective this year [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1841.24s)]
*  I imagine they'll do whatever it takes to avoid Social Security [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1843.76s)]
*  Benefit cuts because they know how unpopular it would be but I also think they are some combo of idiots and liars all the time [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1847.28s)]
*  so people do need to be on alert for any story about retirees who couldn't get their benefits on time because [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1853.52s)]
*  That's you lay off that many people at the Social Security Administration, which I'm sure wasn't [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1860.1200000000001s)]
*  the model of efficiency before that yeah, yeah, you [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1864.92s)]
*  Those Social Security checks gets paused. You'll see a geezer insurrection. It makes the fucking January 6th look like a PTA meeting [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1869.88s)]
*  Oh, I remember remember [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1876.22s)]
*  Around the Affordable Care Act, you know Obama used to say if you like your plan you can keep it [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1878.6000000000001s)]
*  But then some plans were canceled because they didn't hit the mandatory requirements [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1883.8000000000002s)]
*  Under the new ACA rules and [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1888.0400000000002s)]
*  my wife's mother had a plan that got canceled and I [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1891.3200000000002s)]
*  Remember having that conversation with her and you know, she was able to get a new one and it was fine [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1895.3200000000002s)]
*  It was probably overall better but like [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1899.3200000000002s)]
*  That that was not a small thing. That was not a blip in their feelings about the ACA or [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1902.72s)]
*  rock Obama's [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1908.2800000000002s)]
*  Standing for the world. Yeah, and to that point people aren't gonna [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1909.7s)]
*  Even if they don't cut benefits like oh we missed it we missed all the checks for Wisconsin this month, right? [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1913.32s)]
*  Or sorry everyone in Kansas. You're not getting or like they you do that for a month. It's mayhem [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1919.4s)]
*  the yeah the again, it's like [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1925.56s)]
*  sounding a broken record but like, you know before Social Security the poorest people in the country were old people and [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1927.96s)]
*  Social Security changed that forever. We live in a world that is different because Social Security [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1935.0s)]
*  Lifted millions of people out of grinding poverty and like you play with that for play with that for a week [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1939.68s)]
*  And they show their ability to feed themselves to make care of themselves and they showed their gratitude by voting for Donald Trump [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1945.2600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, at least the first time well [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1951.3000000000002s)]
*  But like part of what you're making is a basic government competence argument [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1953.8400000000001s)]
*  And you know if suddenly a bunch of Social Security checks don't go out that like shatters people's [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1957.3200000000002s)]
*  Confidence in the US government in a way that I think is really hard to recover from it [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1961.96s)]
*  Again the Affordable Care Act the healthcare gov rollout was more than just a website being broken for a while [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1964.9s)]
*  It just fundamentally undercut people's faith in the administration to roll out and administer their health care [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1970.14s)]
*  Yeah, it's a very personal thing Social Security field offices are not the driver of our national debt or deficit [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1976.38s)]
*  These are tiny tiny costs that provide basic services. It's all fake. It's all bullshit [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1982.5s)]
*  So same weekend Elon called Social Security a Ponzi scheme Trump announced a safer place to invest our tax dollars [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1988.22s)]
*  crypto [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1994.24s)]
*  He posted that in order to quote make sure the US is the crypto capital of the world [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=1995.44s)]
*  He's creating a crypto strategic reserve that would stockpile five cryptocurrencies [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2000.24s)]
*  XRP Solano Cardano Bitcoin and aetherium [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2006.2800000000002s)]
*  Don't even know what half those things are Tommy care to explain what this is all about [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2010.0400000000002s)]
*  So the the initial tweet said the reserve would include XRP sol and ADA that's ripple Solana and Cardano [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2013.68s)]
*  Then he quote tweeted himself saying of course, it'll also include Bitcoin and aetherium and that will matter in a second. So [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2021.2s)]
*  This idea has been on like the top of the crypto [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2027.1200000000001s)]
*  Bitcoin maximalist wish list for a long time because if you own a lot of cryptocurrency early [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2031.1200000000001s)]
*  And then the US government pumps a lot of money to it. Your Bitcoin is going to go up in price [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2036.26s)]
*  The main elected official pushing this idea has been Cynthia Loomis a senator from Wyoming. I'm sure everyone here at this table [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2041.44s)]
*  Very well aware of Cynthia Loomis. She introduced the boosting innovation technology competitiveness through optimized investment nationwide or [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2048.84s)]
*  Bitcoin and Bitcoin [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2058.2400000000002s)]
*  Was trying to I was trying to follow you as you're saying I'm like, oh get it [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2060.2400000000002s)]
*  Okay, so you put out the Bitcoin act the NAMBLA act as love it called it a conference in 2024 where Trump also [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2063.48s)]
*  Spoke her bill is basically she frames it as a way to bring down the debt which makes no sense [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2069.92s)]
*  But the gist of it is the US government buys a million bitcoins [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2073.44s)]
*  Which is about 5% of total supply of bitcoins over a set period of time using existing Treasury funds [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2076.28s)]
*  They say will be paid for by these existing Treasury funds because it's like accounting gimmicks to make it sound like it's cost-free [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2081.68s)]
*  But the money is fungible. So for spending US government money on Bitcoin, you're not spending on something else. Obviously, it's not free [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2087.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, it's only it's only and also it's only fungible if you consider it like a stable asset like the fucking dollar, right? [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2094.48s)]
*  But it's not it's a it's a highly volatile it's like it's buying stock it's buying stocks [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2100.12s)]
*  Yeah [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2105.08s)]
*  so the reason I'm talking about this Loomis bill though is because there's no details of whatever Trump's plan is beyond these tweets and [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2105.44s)]
*  Except that the Loomis plan was just Bitcoin while Trump's plan included those other cryptocurrencies like ripple and Cardano [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2112.24s)]
*  Which are why a lot of Bitcoin and do advocates actually don't like what Trump rolled out because those other currencies are like [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2119.3199999999997s)]
*  Jokes like no one uses ripple no one uses Cardano Solana is like a platform through which you you makes other stuff off it [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2126.6s)]
*  Like mean coins. It's the idea that like if you are a Bitcoin maximalist and you believe that Bitcoin is the new gold [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2132.72s)]
*  Okay, I guess you could argue for diversifying that like our holdings of stuff [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2138.8s)]
*  But like not for this other shit coins that no one ever uses [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2143.56s)]
*  so the only argument for how those other currencies get into the mix here is because [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2147.2400000000002s)]
*  Special interest lobbying in corruption and surprise surprise trumpet dinner with the CEO of ripple in early January [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2153.16s)]
*  He's now surrounded by these Silicon Valley guys [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2160.2s)]
*  With vested financial interests like David Sachs the AIs are so cryptos this he tweets us out [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2164.08s)]
*  Crypto prices spiked on Sunday about 10% now [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2170.4399999999996s)]
*  They're crashing down as we're recording this and I guess there's like a big White House crypto meeting on Friday [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2173.18s)]
*  But like there's a good chance that this tweet was all it was and it was just a chance to pump and dump [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2179.0s)]
*  Oh my god [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2185.86s)]
*  You're previously holding these these chairs because a bunch of crypto news sites reported on someone making a 50 times [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2186.64s)]
*  Levered bet on Bitcoin and Ethereum on Saturday only to cash it out for a six point eight million dollar profit on Sunday [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2192.76s)]
*  So must be nice. What do you think guys? [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2201.46s)]
*  We're not for knocks full of thumb drives, let's just say what are we what are we stockpiling? [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2203.92s)]
*  This is so fucking stupid. It's not gold. It's not a look. What are we? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2208.6s)]
*  It's not a by the way, we're gonna run out it like yeah, we have a strategic reserve [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2212.56s)]
*  We're gonna run out of the fake money. Yeah, look what if the government ran out of crypto what happened? What happened? Nothing. Nothing happens [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2218.64s)]
*  We have stockpile some grass. Yeah, it's [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2225.4s)]
*  The like it's so outrageous on its face. Also, I know it's I know it's almost quaint now [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2228.12s)]
*  Something that should probably take an act of fucking Congress [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2233.94s)]
*  I think it would require one and then and and like the even just the announcing of the specific currencies again [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2236.74s)]
*  Like if there was an actual Syria like a strategic crypto reserve is the dumbest fucking thing I've ever heard of it's not strategic [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2243.0s)]
*  It's not a reserve [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2249.94s)]
*  It's just a bank account that would be owning that we just put put us dollars into I guess hoping that [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2250.8199999999997s)]
*  And then some of the one of the other rationales will hear is like well [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2255.6s)]
*  Because taxpayers would then own a share of [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2259.56s)]
*  cryptocurrency as it rises and like you know, I like hate to be a small-c conservative here [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2262.44s)]
*  There's a great way for taxpayers to benefit from cryptocurrency if they'd like they can buy cryptocurrency with their own fucking dollars [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2267.16s)]
*  Yeah, take them take the money and treasure that you're gonna put in the in the reserve and hand out some tax cuts [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2273.16s)]
*  I don't know [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2278.24s)]
*  Everybody give card buy what a crypto you're fucking want [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2283.12s)]
*  There's also no guarantee that [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2286.04s)]
*  Bitcoin price will rise like if it was guaranteed to rise then like the way markets work is it would already be priced at that [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2287.88s)]
*  Level right because that's how guarantees work [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2293.96s)]
*  I mean it so none of this makes sense you come along create a new cryptocurrency that that [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2295.52s)]
*  Displaces Bitcoin all of our holdings go to zero [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2300.04s)]
*  Also, the the US government holding a ton of cryptocurrency or Bitcoin is completely antithetical to like the libertarian [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2302.76s)]
*  Anti-government roots of these cryptocurrencies. Yeah, I thought the whole reason we're doing crypto and the blockchain is because we don't [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2309.56s)]
*  Trust central governments and banks around the world and we want like what was that whole thing and also also [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2316.04s)]
*  If the US government suddenly has massive holdings of bitcoins [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2323.4s)]
*  That's stuck because if the US announces that we're selling off our bitcoins [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2328.76s)]
*  Suddenly the price of bitcoins will fucking plummet some of these currencies that Trump is talking about buying if the US has any [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2333.64s)]
*  Meaningful stake in it. We own a huge share of the global supply of these of these coins [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2339.48s)]
*  You know the like with these Trump mean coins, right all these people that put money into it [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2344.98s)]
*  They can only get that money out if somebody's willing to buy it at that price now [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2348.7400000000002s)]
*  Trump makes money on the transaction fees and if you want you could probably [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2352.14s)]
*  You know show your crypto wallet to Trump and say look on bone all your fucking coins [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2356.06s)]
*  You know just to get a great deal out of it [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2359.58s)]
*  But like so what this is is like this first is there's so many there's like so many ways like a Russian nesting doll of corruption [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2361.38s)]
*  Trump [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2367.18s)]
*  Made this Trump has these allies who are in the crypto business. He's doing a huge favor for them [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2368.26s)]
*  Trump himself is making a ton of money off of crypto, right? And so he wants to have crypto succeed and like [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2373.2799999999997s)]
*  And on top of all of that you have this now this this legitimated [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2382.7599999999998s)]
*  Scheme where foreign leaders in government and anybody who wants a government contract can basically put money [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2387.3999999999996s)]
*  Virtually directly into Donald Trump's pocket. It's untraceable, but you can still show him you can prove it to him [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2393.3599999999997s)]
*  Do you think after [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2398.52s)]
*  Trump and Elon and the Doge boys go to a Fort Knox to check out the gold [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2400.04s)]
*  They'll check out the it feels like the Doge should kind of check out the crypto reserve if that ever gets off the ground [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2405.16s)]
*  Yeah, the Fort Knox is a good place for Doge. I don't know where this came from [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2409.96s)]
*  Well now I'm starting to understand where it's coming from because basically they're trying to equate having a holding like a reserve of crypto to [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2413.2s)]
*  Having a reserve of gold and they're trying to make the argument that gold is somehow [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2420.34s)]
*  Just as insecure or dangerous or a risky asset to hold as these [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2424.44s)]
*  Digital mining bucks. Yeah, don't don't trust anything. Yeah, except that which makes us money [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2429.84s)]
*  well like to your point like a strategic oil reserve makes sense because you're gonna need to use oil like [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2434.6s)]
*  Gold you could make a similar resource. You could make the argument with with crypto that you could make with gold like look in a pinch [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2439.92s)]
*  We can't eat gold, right? [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2445.46s)]
*  It's only as value because for thousands of years it is at value [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2446.56s)]
*  But they're going to run off like 15 years they could just disappear and no one would know. Yeah, like I I [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2448.88s)]
*  Don't care about the gold at Fort Knox [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2453.16s)]
*  but I like the it's not like you have oil because in an emergency if suddenly oil supplies are cut off by our adversaries or [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2454.72s)]
*  There's a pressure whatever you need oil to have the economy functions other strategic helium reserve [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2461.6s)]
*  Because it's fun to use at parties [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2466.64s)]
*  but like there's lots of [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2468.04s)]
*  But like you have a reserve of something that you need in an emergency, right? [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2469.44s)]
*  And it doesn't crypto is not what you need [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2473.3599999999997s)]
*  Also long term crypto currency will undercut the use of the dollar as the world's reserve currency [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2475.4s)]
*  Which long story short gives us a ton of power and influence and and on the corruption part [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2480.18s)]
*  I mean I had this really smart reporter on named Zeke Fox on the February 26 episode of Pod Save the World and I [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2484.3799999999997s)]
*  Called him today. Just like check back in on this. There's this guy named Justin Sun [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2489.8999999999996s)]
*  Who is a you heard of him? Yeah, Chinese crypto entrepreneur. He bought [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2494.58s)]
*  $75 million worth of Trump's world Liberty Financial tokens [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2499.8199999999997s)]
*  This is a certain crypto asset where the Trump family gets 75% of the profits from that coin [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2503.22s)]
*  Right off the top. He just gets a rip of 75% the SEC just paused its case against Justin Sun [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2510.48s)]
*  They're investigating him for basically fraud [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2516.44s)]
*  Yeah, the if you go to the world just woken up one day and decided they didn't have a case [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2519.36s)]
*  They were if you go to the world Liberty website, it's just Donald Trump on the front [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2523.2400000000002s)]
*  He is he is called their chief crypto advocate. His sons are ambassadors in other fake roles [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2527.1600000000003s)]
*  They are by the way, the SEC also paused a lawsuit against finance. It it stopped an enforcement action. It gets coinbase [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2532.1400000000003s)]
*  They are stopping the SEC's crackdown that was led by Gary Gensler under the Biden administration [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2539.32s)]
*  So basically they are removing any breaks. They're moving any guardrails any transparency [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2545.1200000000003s)]
*  They're gonna make this make it basically impossible to detect fraud to detect corruption. Like that is the plan. That is the plan [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2550.6000000000004s)]
*  Just bring more efficiency to government [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2558.6000000000004s)]
*  But you see Eric Trump tweeted by the dip on Tuesday [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2560.52s)]
*  Yeah, this announcement happened Sunday. Hmm. Wonder if he was in a position to know something about [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2563.2000000000003s)]
*  Price [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2567.6800000000003s)]
*  Can we talk about Doge? Please sure I'd love to hear about those. They are they're not batting a thousand these days [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2569.28s)]
*  The Times has a truly humiliating story about Doge taking credit for saving 53 million dollars [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2575.1600000000003s)]
*  Supposedly by ending a Coast Guard contract that lapsed 20 years ago and was only ever worth [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2581.36s)]
*  144 thousand dollars. Yeah, cry me a river [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2587.48s)]
*  Tons of examples like that [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2591.48s)]
*  Okay [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2596.88s)]
*  Go on there's a lot of examples like that. They're just all over the place there there some of them [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2599.6800000000003s)]
*  They're they're correcting their mistake. They keep mistaking millions for billions [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2604.76s)]
*  They're saying billions when they're actually cutting millions. It's a mess [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2607.92s)]
*  Yeah, they claim to save eight billion dollars on like a DEI program for ice when in fact it was an eight million dollar program [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2610.12s)]
*  Yes, so this is what's happening there [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2615.96s)]
*  We also got word that Trump fired one of the last remaining career officials at USAID Nicholas Enric [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2618.08s)]
*  Who just wrote a series of memos to sound the alarm that despite Marco Rubio's promise to unfreeze all [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2624.3199999999997s)]
*  Life-saving humanitarian assistance the agency was quote never actually given the opportunity to implement life-saving humanitarian assistance [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2631.48s)]
*  Thanks to Doge canceling contracts [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2639.3599999999997s)]
*  blocking payment systems and just putting a bunch of obstacles in the way of getting the money out the door and rich projected another [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2641.6s)]
*  166 thousand deaths per year from malaria another [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2648.8799999999997s)]
*  100,000 children per year paralyzed with polio more than 28,000 new cases of deadly diseases like Ebola [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2653.8799999999997s)]
*  And Marburg each year and another million children per year who won't be treated for severe acute malnutrition [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2660.96s)]
*  Which often kills them so on this last point? [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2668.12s)]
*  I saw the CNN story over the weekend that about this this company in Georgia and [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2672.48s)]
*  what they do is they make this peanut paste and [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2680.04s)]
*  They give this peanut [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2683.0s)]
*  It's like full of vitamins and nutrients and they basically give this little packet to a child [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2684.52s)]
*  Who's suffering from severe acute malnutrition and they can survive? [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2689.44s)]
*  it's this like miracle thing USAID has been handing it out for years and years and years and [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2693.3599999999997s)]
*  The company that produces this had like enough [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2698.68s)]
*  Peanut paste for 400,000 kids to save 400,000 kids ready to go right on it. They said like [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2703.96s)]
*  From the American people USAID all in these packets ready to go the United States government had already purchased them [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2711.3599999999997s)]
*  $10,000,000 we already paid for this and was informed by Doge that the contract was canceled and the guys like I have all this [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2718.7599999999998s)]
*  Peanut paste now that's just gonna go to waste. I can't I can't send it anywhere because it's got USAID all over it [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2725.3599999999997s)]
*  They told me not to do it and that's it. So now all these kids are not gonna get the life-saving nutrition [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2730.24s)]
*  So I see this thing I get really annoyed. I tweet about it and I was like [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2735.58s)]
*  I Tweet about Elon doing this with not even saving us money. Just like not sending this stuff out. We already paid for it and [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2739.56s)]
*  Saturday night. It's Saturday night. Yeah, I [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2746.48s)]
*  Say right before I saw you on Saturday night [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2749.64s)]
*  Oh, and I was I was on the way I tweeted and then I got home and I'm in bed and I was like [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2751.6800000000003s)]
*  Oh, oh he responded my phone wasn't blowing up that night [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2755.44s)]
*  And so Eli responded and he called me [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2761.48s)]
*  Dollar store John Favreau and said I'm an imbecilic propagandist who lies to score cheap political points [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2766.16s)]
*  And then he said that said I will investigate this [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2772.68s)]
*  So he's got you dead to rights [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2777.3199999999997s)]
*  He's still figuring out the comment card thing [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2780.52s)]
*  And we'll fix it if so and so then the next so I decide, you know, it's it's late at night [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2783.4399999999996s)]
*  Have a few drinks. I'm not gonna reply now. So I just went to bed [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2789.72s)]
*  It was that was smart right woke up in the morning he has replied again [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2792.3999999999996s)]
*  He was like the contract has been reinstated. It was already reinstated last week. They should get the payment [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2796.0s)]
*  Soon and he's like and then he lists the company. I'm like what company is that it's another [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2802.2799999999997s)]
*  Peanut paste company in Rhode Island that he had also canceled the contract to it. And so I wrote back to him like actually that's great [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2807.6s)]
*  But the company was in Georgia. It was at CNN [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2812.96s)]
*  It was this company and then and then later Sunday night [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2815.48s)]
*  MJ Lee at CNN who broke the original story about the Georgia company was like [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2819.8s)]
*  I just got a call from the guy in the Georgia company and he said it was the contract was reinstated just minutes ago [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2823.52s)]
*  so [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2830.08s)]
*  so then [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2831.12s)]
*  So this morning Elon was like he said he replies to me again and he was like so just so you know [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2832.64s)]
*  It wasn't because of the legacy media or or Kmart faves [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2839.52s)]
*  You upgraded you upgraded me [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2844.4s)]
*  Yeah, well I had said that I would at least want to be target John Favre in my reply to him because I thought I would [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2847.4s)]
*  You know, it's like a little air won't I think I was trying to be constructive [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2852.0s)]
*  I didn't tweet this much from a k-hole [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2856.38s)]
*  Exactly, and and he was like it wasn't that it was just we just needed a brief pause and no one has died yet [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2859.04s)]
*  And what I said in the oval about Ebola protection was right [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2865.7599999999998s)]
*  That was it was it is turned back on and it just takes a while for the money to go through all the systems of [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2868.8799999999997s)]
*  blah blah blah [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2873.72s)]
*  Meanwhile as he's tweeting this I'm looking at this guy from USAID who just left and write a memo like no [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2874.2s)]
*  Rubio gave all these waivers to the life-saving assistance and no none of them could be implemented [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2879.68s)]
*  Yeah, the the the no one has died is like not the defense you like it's like they're like if you're out there being like [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2885.3199999999997s)]
*  I want to reassure everyone no one has yet died as far as I know as far as I know [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2891.64s)]
*  You know like first of all great first of all great posting by the way [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2896.24s)]
*  Great posting new year's resolution really [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2900.32s)]
*  Remember when you and I were like away when he said his resolution was post more we like scoffed [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2902.84s)]
*  She was like why what's the point paid for itself? [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2907.32s)]
*  Also, I've been pivoting to tick-tock because I'm just trying to [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2911.2s)]
*  Don't let anyone tell you it's not going great it's going good [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2919.48s)]
*  Good 43 43 is the year vertical video the but like [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2922.1600000000003s)]
*  I know I was trying to be nice [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2928.36s)]
*  But [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2935.2000000000003s)]
*  Like you go back to like the the Elon Jimmy more I saw I don't did right [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2936.8s)]
*  No, no, if you go back to Elon in the oval when he's I'm sorry if you go back to Elon in the cabinet meeting [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2940.76s)]
*  Where he was where he spoke to the cabinet? [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2946.76s)]
*  Before anyone else got a chance to speak and he said you know I'm really support. You know I'm here to support you [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2949.2400000000002s)]
*  but the reason we're doing this is because [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2955.5600000000004s)]
*  We're in an emergency, and we have to cut if we want to hit my goal of 1.x trillion dollars of cuts [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2957.88s)]
*  We've got to cut 4 billion dollars a day. That's the only way to do it. You got to cut 4 billion dollars a day [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2964.0s)]
*  I do just all of this is just [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2968.6000000000004s)]
*  Exposing like how that is stupid at every level first of all actually that's you don't have to cut 4 billion dollars [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2971.6000000000004s)]
*  Today you don't have to scramble through the agencies finding little bits to cut every day if you have a if you have a goal [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2978.76s)]
*  For a giant budget cut you want to make you can propose it through Congress [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2984.8s)]
*  And you can do it and oh and by the way go even one step further [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2987.88s)]
*  Let's say you don't want to do it that way [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2990.96s)]
*  You just said you you have all these cabinet secretaries go to the cabinet secretaries and say I need this [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2992.7200000000003s)]
*  I need a proposal for this many cuts by this date [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2997.6400000000003s)]
*  And I know it's gonna be hard [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=2999.76s)]
*  And I'm gonna be driving you guys every day, and I'm gonna be meeting with you [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3000.6800000000003s)]
*  Well we can cut but no one fucking adult tech bro cannot oversee [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3003.96s)]
*  These cuts across every layer of our government. It's gonna lead to kids fucking dying well in this you know I had a friend [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3009.64s)]
*  Asked me reading about all this and he was like well [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3017.08s)]
*  But he's like no [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3019.7200000000003s)]
*  Isn't it possible that there is a lot of waste that we can get rid of there and that we also want to send out [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3021.2000000000003s)]
*  Life-saving assistance like wow isn't both right [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3026.44s)]
*  If they wanted to do that they could have audited USAID [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3029.44s)]
*  They could have used their the authority that they have to trim where they could and they could have then sent Congress a list [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3033.2799999999997s)]
*  Which they control a list of cuts a list of layoffs that they wanted to do they could have done all that if the whole [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3040.12s)]
*  Thing was about efficiency. I mean Pete Hicks F [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3046.6s)]
*  Remember when he got to the Defense Department was like I want to cut the workforce by 8% at the department [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3049.2s)]
*  So send me ideas for this by whatever I'm not saying that [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3054.52s)]
*  strategic [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3058.56s)]
*  Was like well if you want to cut your agency [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3062.44s)]
*  That's one way to do it just like put out a goal what they have done. This is not what they were doing at USAID [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3064.4s)]
*  I mean look [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3069.56s)]
*  We eradicated smallpox off the face of the earth with like the next goal was to eradicate polio [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3071.08s)]
*  And I think it was only found in Afghanistan and Pakistan the fact that it's not going to resurge because of these cuts like Jesus Christ [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3077.2s)]
*  What a what a hit to humanity on the USAID money generally I do think like yeah [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3083.36s)]
*  People are gonna die. They're gonna be refugee camps in Sudan where they're gonna run out of food babies are gonna die [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3087.96s)]
*  There's me people even giving AIDS medicines under the PEPFAR program. That'll be gone in months now [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3093.44s)]
*  There's gonna be I personally think that that is cruel and morally wrong and damaging to our standing in the world in the long term [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3098.4s)]
*  As a nation, but let's say your view on this is the United States can't feed every starving person anywhere everywhere [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3104.42s)]
*  And we can't be the world's policeman [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3111.08s)]
*  Then you say to them, okay, what about programs that help people that we actively harmed as a nation right early on in this process [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3113.24s)]
*  We talked about the the freeze and fornade [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3119.2799999999997s)]
*  Stopping programs that clean up unexploded bombs that the United States dropped on Vietnam and Laos in Cambodia [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3123.2s)]
*  If we don't clean those up little kids pick them up their arms get blown off. They get killed [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3129.48s)]
*  They're gonna die [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3134.56s)]
*  like there was a the New York Times recently had a story about a doge cut that [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3135.44s)]
*  Cut off funding to a program that provides like the most meager amount of support to people who are severely [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3139.12s)]
*  disabled because of Agent Orange because the United States [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3145.48s)]
*  Dropped Agent Orange on their villages during the Vietnam War and then people live there had kids who these severe disabilities now [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3148.4s)]
*  We're cutting off loans to these people like that's the reality of what's happening [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3155.48s)]
*  It's like, you know what? [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3159.56s)]
*  We are the richest country on earth in the history of the earth and we are not [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3160.16s)]
*  That Elon Musk is worth [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3166.86s)]
*  400 billion dollars. Okay. This is not like hey middle-class family in Ohio [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3169.34s)]
*  We're gonna we got to raise your taxes to help feed starving people in some other country [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3175.62s)]
*  like we have a billionaires running all over this country and we're talking about 25 cent fucking peanut packets and [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3181.02s)]
*  In malaria nets and an HIV medication, which is now pretty cheap now that we've had for like [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3187.06s)]
*  What are we talking about right now? We can't fucking afford this [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3192.5s)]
*  And by the way [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3195.14s)]
*  The end result of this is not reducing the deficit by whatever trillion dollar goal. He line has said they want to take that money [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3196.46s)]
*  They want to put a hundred billion of it into a crypto reserve [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3203.7799999999997s)]
*  And they want to take the rest and they want to divvy it out to Elon Musk and all these people through a gigantic [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3206.58s)]
*  Tax cut for the rich and by the way all the cuts [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3211.3799999999997s)]
*  Ilana was making would never even if he were to hit his goals [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3213.94s)]
*  Which he can't because he's doing this is such a chaotic and terrible way [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3216.98s)]
*  Even if he did it would be obliterated [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3219.74s)]
*  By the cost of the tax cuts [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3222.3799999999997s)]
*  Which is why they have to go even further and look to cut Medicaid or look to cut social security or whatever [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3223.9799999999996s)]
*  They're gonna do to try to pay for these giant tax cuts [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3228.8599999999997s)]
*  So none of this results in any kind of tangible benefit for actual [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3231.06s)]
*  American citizens, right? [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3235.2599999999998s)]
*  Like and by the way, none of this was part of like this was not the core of their campaign [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3236.4199999999996s)]
*  They they campaign to lower the cost of goods. We are getting a dismantling of the federal government [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3240.2999999999997s)]
*  Speaking of that Trump said late Monday [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3245.2599999999998s)]
*  Which is when we're recording this that a 25% tariff on all Mexican and Canadian goods and an additional 10% tariff on all [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3247.46s)]
*  Chinese goods will go into effect on Tuesday. He backed off these tariffs at the last minute once before so who knows if he'll do it again [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3254.34s)]
*  Who knows why he changed his mind? [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3261.86s)]
*  But either way stock market had the worst day of the year [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3263.5800000000004s)]
*  On Monday and a lot of shit is about to get very expensive unless of course you're listening to this Tuesday morning [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3267.3s)]
*  And he backed off last minute again [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3272.6800000000003s)]
*  According to Bloomberg for example car prices alone would increase by [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3274.7599999999998s)]
*  $12,000 if the tariffs go through at the levels Trump is promising [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3278.9199999999996s)]
*  This comes at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's estimate now predicts the economy to shrink by 2.8 percent this quarter [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3283.7599999999998s)]
*  and a wave of new polling from CBS [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3291.24s)]
*  Marist [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3294.48s)]
*  CNN [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3297.0s)]
*  Shows that people think that Trump is not doing enough to focus on the economy and inflation [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3298.0s)]
*  His approval rating keeps dropping but the weakest spot is [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3303.08s)]
*  Economy and inflation which is ironic because those used to be his strongest issues [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3306.36s)]
*  It sure seems like a lot of flashing red lights for the Trump administration that they're just ignoring [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3309.96s)]
*  Do you think they don't know don't care? Do you think they think it's just temporary? [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3314.68s)]
*  I mean, this is what they want to do. That's just theory of the case [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3317.92s)]
*  This is economic vision is you throw up all these tariffs and somehow that will ultimately rebuild domestic manufacturing or our ability to produce goods [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3320.72s)]
*  I just feel very unlikely and you know [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3328.2799999999997s)]
*  We're gonna put in place these tariffs on Canada and Mexico and they're gonna retaliate like the Canadians have talked about [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3331.12s)]
*  25 percent tariffs on 30 billion dollars worth of goods of US products and then that might expand to [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3336.72s)]
*  85 billion more and they're talking about ag products consumer goods liquor. I think they're targeting Republican districts like [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3343.0s)]
*  bourbon [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3349.9199999999996s)]
*  Appliances and in Mexico has not been public about their retaliations, but they're preparing them [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3351.48s)]
*  So you made the point like the auto sectors are so entwined between the US and Canada and Mexico and I don't know how [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3356.52s)]
*  That's gonna work [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3361.8s)]
*  Mexico and Canada account for 70% of US crude oil imports [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3363.52s)]
*  So gas prices could go up and also we're talking about trade agreements that [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3366.96s)]
*  Like Jared Kushner [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3372.88s)]
*  The USMCA was the updated NAFTA that Trump like was one of the things Trump talked about as a primary [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3375.88s)]
*  Accomplishment in the first time. Yeah, there was a when he was first talking about the tariffs a couple weeks ago [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3382.2000000000003s)]
*  He said I look at these deals and I'm like who negotiate these deals you did these are your deals [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3385.7599999999998s)]
*  These are your deals. He wants to squeeze our allies [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3389.8399999999997s)]
*  He wants to squeeze them and and get a better deal out of them and just keep squeezing them and squeezing them until they become [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3392.3199999999997s)]
*  The 51st 52nd 53rd 54th state. I really think that that's this is part of it the I'm sure that's right [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3397.46s)]
*  Yeah, I was an economic war against Canada to just [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3403.7999999999997s)]
*  Beat them into submission and he's stupid because like you said, it's it's gonna hurt us. Well, so so far is backfiring [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3407.96s)]
*  I mean his his [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3413.68s)]
*  sensible political allies are the conservative parties up there this guy Pierre Poliev and he still might be the next [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3415.56s)]
*  Canadian Prime Minister, but Justin Trudeau's polling was like a rock bottom. He stepped back [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3421.8399999999997s)]
*  They did this thing where they think it's called pro-roguing Parliament [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3426.96s)]
*  We're basically the Liberal Party is now gonna figure out its new leader and that person will then become the Prime Minister when they go [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3429.7999999999997s)]
*  Back into session in like a couple weeks and the Liberal Party's polls polling numbers because of Trump's attacks have gone way back up [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3435.7s)]
*  Yeah, like they're he is rallying support and you're seeing Canadians [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3442.64s)]
*  booing the national anthem and all this sort of the Canadian nationalism and it's just it's not working he might he might be you know [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3446.2799999999997s)]
*  Trump might lead to a resurgence of the center left all over the world except except here. I guess that'd be cool [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3453.16s)]
*  Yeah, well here we've already been sort of beaten to a bloody pulp [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3457.3199999999997s)]
*  but the yeah like the I was thinking about just sort of Trump as this negotiator, right and like it's kind of an old saw at [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3460.7s)]
*  this point that [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3467.3199999999997s)]
*  He'd be richer today if he had just taken his inheritance and putting in the SMP, right? [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3469.04s)]
*  He's just not a very good businessman and like you kind of see in how he is president why he was such a bad businessman [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3472.72s)]
*  Which is he just he can't think long-term. Yeah, can't think strategically and so like very short-term, you know, you look at like [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3477.84s)]
*  like a [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3483.84s)]
*  Terrace you say all right. Your goal was to build up domestic [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3485.0s)]
*  Manufacturing and you want tariffs to our one lever, you know in doing that, right? Well, some of the things you're terrifying, right? [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3488.56s)]
*  It would take a decade to build a steel plant right take a decade to improve our capacity and in whatever it might be refining oil [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3494.68s)]
*  Whatever like putting on the tariff doesn't result in that at all. We're actually completely [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3501.44s)]
*  Dependent on on Canada Mexico for a lot of parts a lot of supplies a lot of materials, right? [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3507.48s)]
*  And so like all of this is so [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3512.62s)]
*  It's just not it's a strategic [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3516.08s)]
*  It's just a guy who had an idea about what makes an economy you put on the tariffs the manufacturing comes back [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3517.7s)]
*  And maybe there's some deep some like very raw sense in which that's on some level true [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3523.08s)]
*  but in the meantime, there's just a decade of pain of [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3527.84s)]
*  Economic stagnation and then the question is if that does come right like, you know, we're gonna talk about the Democrats [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3531.92s)]
*  And I believe that's how you pronounce it [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3538.16s)]
*  But it like we we like what happens when we move from things could get really bad to things are really bad [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3540.2s)]
*  And right like how does that change Trump? And then how does that change how the American people feel about our response? [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3546.72s)]

*  Well Democrats are continuing to workshop their response strategy in public as we like to do great [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3727.14s)]
*  One spicy take on this came last week from the raging Cajun himself James Carville who wrote in a New York Times op-ed quote [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3734.7400000000002s)]
*  With no clear leader to voice our opposition and no control in any branch of government [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3741.06s)]
*  It's time for Democrats to embark on the most daring political maneuver in the history of our party [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3745.9s)]
*  Roll over and play dead allow the Republicans to crumble beneath their own weight and make the American people miss us [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3751.1000000000004s)]
*  Unsurprisingly actual elected Democrats have thoughts on this. Here's Bernie Sanders on meet the press this Sunday [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3758.78s)]
*  The problem is the Democrats have been playing dead for too many years. I don't think you play dead [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3764.34s)]
*  I think you stand up for the working class of this country and make the point [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3769.26s)]
*  13 of the people that he nominated to head agencies are billionaires. Their greed is uncontrollable [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3773.7000000000003s)]
*  We've got to fight back. That's what these trips to Wisconsin and Michigan will be about just [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3780.6200000000003s)]
*  Right down the middle for Bernie's [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3786.54s)]
*  Oh [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3788.54s)]
*  Democrats fight or give up Bernie, what do you take? [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3792.74s)]
*  What do you think about Carvel's prescription so first of all so when I was reading it [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3798.34s)]
*  I sort of like asked myself a question before I got to the answer and the question was does a strategic retreat mean we [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3803.66s)]
*  Help them fund the government or to strategic retreat mean we don't help them fund the government, right? [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3812.1s)]
*  And like so and then you kind of get to it [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3817.38s)]
*  He says like actually we should hang back for a while [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3819.54s)]
*  It's not totally clear but like kind of come in at the last minute [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3821.7400000000002s)]
*  when they've already shown themselves to be terrible and failures and chaotic and then come into the last second and say what we stand for and [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3824.7000000000003s)]
*  Help reopen the government for example [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3830.98s)]
*  And it's what if it gets it [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3832.26s)]
*  I think the problem here which is I think when you talk about like should the Democrats fight or should they retreat in an abstraction? [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3833.54s)]
*  Like I don't really know how you like act on this right? [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3838.2000000000003s)]
*  Like he's doing terrible things should Chris Murphy not go to the floor and talk about them [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3841.02s)]
*  Yeah, like should be like like I have no I have no comment on the dismantling of NATO [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3845.66s)]
*  That's just not how it works. So I don't tape your mouth. I don't think that's what James meant [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3850.14s)]
*  No, of course. I'm so like what I took it to mean is like kind of a kind of [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3854.18s)]
*  What's the word a kind of since a kind of sensational? [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3858.8599999999997s)]
*  What metaphor a metaphor? No, like a kind of um sensationalistic way of saying Democrats have to be strategic [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3862.7s)]
*  But like all in all where I land after reading it is like I don't I don't know what we get by hanging back [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3869.14s)]
*  It's not like we get credits later when we speak more forcefully for the times. We were quiet earlier on [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3874.02s)]
*  Yeah, I just think like Trump is the most relentless messenger in the history of politics [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3879.2599999999998s)]
*  And I think we can't let him talk in a vacuum or else like he's gonna pin every failure on [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3883.46s)]
*  Democrats and some not insignificant part of the electorate will think that egg prices are high because of Gaza protesters had barnard [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3888.58s)]
*  You know what I mean? And so that's not true. That as far as I know that is not true. Yes the Jews [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3895.42s)]
*  And I do think just the Jews I think you're right love it like [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3900.6200000000003s)]
*  It's smarter to talk about these fights around a specific thing like the budget [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3904.5400000000004s)]
*  But I do think we have an opportunity there to drive the message [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3908.98s)]
*  It's really strong, which is that Donald Trump is allowing this [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3911.7400000000002s)]
*  Unelected unwell billionaire to break the US government so that you could pretend [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3915.6600000000003s)]
*  It's gonna save enough money to pay for a five to a trillion dollar tax cut for the richest people in the country [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3920.5800000000004s)]
*  I think that's a good story [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3925.1600000000003s)]
*  We have a good villain in Elon Musk and but we're not gonna win this fight with like op-eds and you know [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3926.66s)]
*  MSNBC it's gonna be a volume game [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3933.06s)]
*  Disagree, yeah [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3935.7799999999997s)]
*  Platforms and local press, but I do think like part of this like has been seeing us on Chris Hayes lately [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3937.2999999999997s)]
*  And the boys were making there like I feel like we have to have like we have to have a motivation [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3942.7799999999997s)]
*  We have to have a story with an enemy and we have to have an alternative. Yes, you know what I mean? [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3947.14s)]
*  That's what yeah, let's get to that the alternative [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3951.56s)]
*  There is a long tradition in politics and I think this is both parties do this which is like when you know [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3954.1s)]
*  Your opposition is fucking up [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3959.98s)]
*  You just stand back and if you put out an alternative [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3961.38s)]
*  Then the opposition, you know, then the other party is just gonna start taking shots at your alternative [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3964.7400000000002s)]
*  And then people aren't gonna like your alternative and blah blah blah [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3969.38s)]
*  And why don't why don't you just stand back and I I get the reasoning behind that? [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3971.42s)]
*  But I also think that we are at a moment now where people are so [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3975.86s)]
*  Cynical about politics tired beat down and [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3982.12s)]
*  Unimpressed with the Democratic Party to say it nicely like we have the party has one of the worst approval ratings [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3985.72s)]
*  It's had ever and I think it is it is incumbent upon Democrats right now more than ever to like offer a vision [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3990.56s)]
*  Offer an alternative say what we would do differently [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=3997.8799999999997s)]
*  I don't think we need to like, you know have a blizzard of policy plans out there at all [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4000.64s)]
*  But I think we need to as we critique Trump like lay out how we would govern differently how we [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4005.18s)]
*  Treat people differently what our vision of the country looks like what our vision of the world looks like like I don't know [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4011.2s)]
*  I mean look we've tried a well, we're not Trump and we're not MAGA a couple times now. It didn't work in 2016 [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4016.0s)]
*  It barely worked in 2020. It didn't work in 2024 [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4023.96s)]
*  It might work in 2026 because it's a midterm electorate, but like we got to think about 2028 here [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4027.08s)]
*  We also got to think about just expanding the map in general because we're never gonna win this like going the way we are [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4032.12s)]
*  We're not gonna control the Senate with the states [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4038.72s)]
*  We have the electoral college could shift and we're gonna need to like pick up more states and like we're just gonna have to compete [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4040.64s)]
*  In tough places, which means you're going to have to give people an alternative [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4045.2s)]
*  Yeah, I mean Trump like before the election Trump went to New York and said I'm gonna win New York and obviously that was [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4048.72s)]
*  ridiculous, but you had at least [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4054.48s)]
*  You had a Republican politician saying I can foresee a day where we win in this state, right? [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4058.08s)]
*  and like there's this kind of [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4062.7999999999997s)]
*  I [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4064.96s)]
*  It's similar honestly to like the kind of managed decline globally [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4066.2000000000003s)]
*  It's like there's sort of like a managed decline to the Democratic brand like oh, we just wheel [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4069.52s)]
*  We can't win in a state like Wyoming [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4073.1600000000003s)]
*  We can't win in a state like Nebraska even though in those states minimum wage bills union bills [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4074.76s)]
*  Marijuana bills abortion bills they pass right and so that tells you that there's this big delta between what people actually want in their lives [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4080.6000000000004s)]
*  In the Democratic brand and and we won't make that brand better [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4087.0s)]
*  We won't fix it by being silent now [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4090.54s)]
*  I what I what I do think is also true is we won't fix it by just being kind of [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4092.58s)]
*  Like whiners on the sidelines, and I think that's the point he makes that did resonate with me [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4096.9s)]
*  Which is like Democrats are powerless. It sucks. We're telling the truth about Trump. He's fucking terrible [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4100.94s)]
*  But we've been saying it for years [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4106.22s)]
*  And by the way, the part of the problem is we were warning for years about how bad it could get [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4107.68s)]
*  It is now as bad as it could get and it's no longer a warning [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4112.62s)]
*  But it sounds like what people have heard before that is not our fault [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4115.9800000000005s)]
*  That is a collective problem with our democracy a weakness Donald Trump exposes [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4118.62s)]
*  But it is the reality of like and which is why I think we get to is like we just need to offer an alternative [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4122.38s)]
*  We need to we need to offer something that isn't about Trump and like I am even open to some of the more kind of like [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4127.34s)]
*  Kooky ideas of like of people saying this is what our cabinet would be doing right now, right? Like I'm like shadow cabinet [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4131.8s)]
*  I'm not against it. I'm not against it. I'm not against the shadow cabinet on the Labour Party's are spelling it with an oh you [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4138.22s)]
*  I'm up for Trump. Yeah, sure sure [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4143.6s)]
*  I do like you I agree that we shouldn't over promise and pick fights that give people the impression that we have power [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4146.86s)]
*  We don't have right because that is that is a that is a problem too is you're like we're gonna fight fight fight fight fight [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4153.48s)]
*  We're gonna stop we're gonna stop them [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4158.74s)]
*  And then it's like obviously we knew we couldn't stop them because we don't have the votes for X or Y, right? [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4159.9s)]
*  Like so I agree that's it's important not to over promise [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4163.639999999999s)]
*  But I still think like you need to fight when you can and just be honest about what power we have and what power we don't [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4166.44s)]
*  The Trump people are gonna break some parts of the government and people are gonna get hurt and they have to understand why that happened [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4171.9s)]
*  Yes, so we've talked about the Doge stuff, but there's another things happen. So in 2020 Congress [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4176.94s)]
*  Passed a bunch of tax credits to make Affordable Care Act plans more affordable. Those were extended through 2025 [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4182.299999999999s)]
*  Those are going to expire and if they are not reauthorized you're gonna see a bunch of middle-class people see like serious premium increases [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4189.08s)]
*  We need to explain to them as Democrats why their premiums are going up [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4196.82s)]
*  Otherwise, it might just happen in a vacuum and people are gonna think oh actually government health care sucks [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4201.219999999999s)]
*  Trump Trump was a Obamacare sucks. Yeah, or the Obamacare sucks [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4205.62s)]
*  No, it's explained that because the Democrats in Congress passed these [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4208.34s)]
*  Enhanced tax credits for the Affordable Care Act. We need a better name from them, by the way [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4212.7s)]
*  And Democrat and the Republican Party and premium support. Thank you. That's even worse and Republicans let them lapse [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4216.58s)]
*  Yeah, no, I mean look I do think that the the budget fight is the fight for sure and I get but I also I'm already [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4223.68s)]
*  like [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4230.36s)]
*  We're heading into the budget fight and I'm already feeling like the most popular testing message [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4232.5599999999995s)]
*  It's just coming right back up and everyone's just gonna be like tax cuts for billionaires to cut your health care [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4237.76s)]
*  And it's the right message [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4241.86s)]
*  But I think we have to be creative in the way we talk about it [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4243.16s)]
*  Like we just can't sound like we have sounded like the last 20 years. So it is the right argument [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4247.18s)]
*  It's you know what I'm saying? Yeah, when I say the right message that doesn't necessarily mean the right words, you know [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4252.32s)]
*  I know I know don't you feel it? I know it's like yes [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4256.639999999999s)]
*  Like we need to like of course they're gonna be well tested [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4260.0599999999995s)]
*  Messages that we're gonna need to use in the short term to make the cleanest argument against what they're doing [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4262.92s)]
*  But at the same time we're trying to make up for what is like ultimately like a huge credibility gap [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4267.0s)]
*  Like we warned the country for several elections in a row about how dangerous Donald Trump was it was very very clear people did not [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4271.3s)]
*  Not enough people believed us not enough people cared either [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4277.759999999999s)]
*  We didn't reach them or if we did they didn't they didn't take it at face value and so that like requires like a deeper [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4279.88s)]
*  You start telling a deeper story about what you believe about the world and it's gonna challenge people's assumptions [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4287.0s)]
*  It's not gonna be exactly what they expect to hear from you. Yeah, or I mean Tommy you made this joke many times [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4292.92s)]
*  Which is like Democrats have been using the line [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4298.0s)]
*  We're gonna stop tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4301.4400000000005s)]
*  We're gonna give those tax breaks to companies who create jobs in America for 20 years [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4305.28s)]
*  And so like is that one of the best polling testing lines? Yeah, I bet it is and I bet when you ask people about it [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4310.96s)]
*  They'd be like, yeah, I really like that [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4317.0s)]
*  Like it's not just polls people but then work hard and play by the rules if you say it for 20 years and it doesn't happen [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4318.2s)]
*  And you just keep saying the same line. It's not gonna land. Well one thing that I think [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4324.12s)]
*  Insulates Trump from a lot of criticism is people think well, he's rich [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4328.84s)]
*  He's not trying to make more money because somehow people have gotten in in their heads that billionaires don't always want more money [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4332.5s)]
*  And that's how you become a millionaire. I think we need to undercut that by [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4337.82s)]

*  Remember that was kind of a narrative but Republicans they will let anyone into the tent including him and they saw [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6E5JoTO98&t=4615.120000000001s)]
