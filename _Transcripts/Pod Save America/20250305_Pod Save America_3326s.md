Video Description: Donald Trump makes history—by delivering the longest Joint Address ever, clocking in at an exhausting 99 minutes of blame, grievance, and sappy stunts. Jon, Lovett, Dan, and Tommy break down all the biggest—and weirdest—moments, from warning of a "disturbance" from the new tariffs, to invading Greenland and cutting off funding for transgender mice (yes, really). Plus, they debate how Rep. Al Green's protest will play, the strengths and weaknesses of Sen. Elissa Slotkin's rebuttal, and what Democrats should do now.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

*  Donald Trump just gave the longest state of the union in history. Final count was 99 minutes [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=6.4s)]
*  So that's the longest speech in history. It was I don't know anyone have thoughts off the bat [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=12.68s)]
*  It felt longer than 99 minutes. It did it did it was a lot of dark [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=18.02s)]
*  Yeah, it was of long descriptions of hideous awful crimes [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=23.48s)]
*  Yeah, his speeches are always long. They're always long. Yeah, I mean look it was a it was a greatest hit speech [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=27.96s)]
*  peppered in with some new [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=35.48s)]
*  stunts and [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=38.2s)]
*  interesting [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=40.08s)]
*  Scary moments, but like a lot of what we've heard before [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=41.44s)]
*  But he's really relishing in it he's really enjoying his he's really he's really enjoying his time up there [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, you could with trumpets always he can give his rally s speech or he can give a more formal [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  Joint address in this case. He decided to do both. Yeah, right [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=58.68s)]
*  It's I would say it was not surprising in any way. No, nothing really new like it felt [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=62.2s)]
*  What I expected we said this before in our live stream like a lot of accomplishments [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=68.28s)]
*  For most of the speech very little news new policy and we'll go through some of it [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=73.88s)]
*  I think it was notable is at the beginning, you know, he did his [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=79.56s)]
*  We've had the greatest month in any from of any president in history [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=84.03999999999999s)]
*  Number two was George Washington Bob us. He's bragging bragging and then early on [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=89.16s)]
*  There was a little bit of an interruption at the beginning of the speech. So let's listen to that [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=94.64s)]
*  We won the popular vote by big numbers and won counties [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=100.88s)]
*  Mr. Green take your seat take your seat, sir [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=109.36s)]
*  Take your seat [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=115.08s)]
*  The members continue to engage in willful and concerted disruption of proper decorum the chair now directs the sergeant-at-arms to restore order [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=117.08s)]
*  Remove this gentleman from the chamber [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=127.48s)]
*  So that was something [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=129.6s)]
*  Basically, so Donald Trump does his whole [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=132.48s)]
*  You know, we've won seven swing states greatest popular vote victory ever [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=135.6s)]
*  How much you even bench bro? Yeah [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=141.28s)]
*  Bunch of Democrats start making some noise Al Green of Texas [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=144.32s)]
*  I'm a big fan of the big guys and I'm a big fan of the big guys [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  I'm a big fan of the big guys and I'm a big fan of the big guys [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=151.72s)]
*  I'm a big fan of the big guys [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=153.72s)]
*  Democrats start making some noise Al Green of Texas [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=155.76s)]
*  starts interrupting him and then [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=160.68s)]
*  You know Mike Johnson was ready for it and decided he was going to tell the sergeant-at-arms to get rid of him [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=162.8s)]
*  Yeah, what did you guys think of that? So his line right is you have no mandate to cut Medicaid? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=169.04s)]
*  That's what he that's what he was that's what his that was the message of his protest [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=173.64s)]
*  So at least you know, he's trying to make a moment about Medicaid [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=176.76s)]
*  I [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=180.2s)]
*  Know is an active protest I think a couple I think there are points here one is if you watch the video [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=185.2s)]
*  There's something really fascistic about the whole thing the way Trump when he starts protesting points at the door [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  Hmm, and then JD Vance starts pointing and then you see Mike Johnson sort of point at the sergeant-of-arms [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=197.76s)]
*  To tell them to go get Al Green like it is a [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  deeply [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=207.32s)]
*  Like we're in the United States Capitol here [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=208.36s)]
*  Moments later Trump will say he ended government censorship as he removes him from it [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=212.28s)]
*  I know he was this is why Mark Zuckerberg so excited about him [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=216.28s)]
*  It's just like they have a plan for this moment. They plan to use [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=219.84s)]
*  Taxpayer-funded law enforcement to remove dissenting voices from the Capitol [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=223.96s)]
*  Well, we should tell the backstory the reason they plan for this moment is is all bad things start with Axios [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=227.28000000000003s)]
*  I [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=232.44s)]
*  Had a report that Democrats were going to like bring eggs in pocket [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=234.68s)]
*  Constitution and try to disrupt the speech and there's a couple reports and it was like sourced to unnamed Democrats [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=239.76s)]
*  And so then Republicans some Republicans were like we there's a report for Max EOS [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=245.8s)]
*  The Democrats are going to throw eggs at Donald Trump [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=250.68s)]
*  Which they were not that was not a report at all [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=253.84s)]
*  And so then the House Freedom Caucus had a post that was like if Democrats interrupt the speech [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=256.42s)]
*  We will have we will censure them which by the way now they're saying that Al Green could be censured. Oh, no [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=262.62s)]
*  Yeah, I know what was that gonna do a censure by the way is the House votes and says you're bad [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=267.70000000000005s)]
*  Seems very quaint and so they're censored members include Marjorie Taylor Green [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=273.34000000000003s)]
*  So they were clearly all ready for this which is why which is [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=277.90000000000003s)]
*  But they were very much ready to do like a kind of hand gesture [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=281.42s)]
*  Yeah, like we want to do a hand gesture and like applauding restoring order [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=284.82s)]
*  I I guess like what I can't I feel like I feel conflicted about it, right? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=289.06s)]
*  Because you know, like there are people who joking like oh Democrats if you really think Donald Trump is an authoritarian menace [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=293.53999999999996s)]
*  Wearing different colored hats is a very silly thing to do right? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=301.05999999999995s)]
*  Like, you know in response to the authoritarian menace we coordinated our outfit that sounds ridiculous [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=303.97999999999996s)]
*  But like but like then I think we didn't because there were purple people in purple people in white [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=308.4s)]
*  He was gonna lie but we had signs that said false [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=312.98s)]
*  Like some people coordinated pink and purple and white and then it's like well, that's just a bunch of different outfits [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=316.54s)]
*  but like the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=320.34000000000003s)]
*  Then you think okay. So what should Democrats do? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=322.34000000000003s)]
*  Right, should they just like this, you know [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=324.86s)]
*  Don't lend Donald Trump the pomp and circumstance of the State of the Union really a joint address to Congress to be exact [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=326.74s)]
*  But like we're like then you say all right Democrats either walk out or they don't show up [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=332.70000000000005s)]
*  Like what does that get us? Right? Like we kind of look childish. We look like we're not being [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=337.1s)]
*  Like we look partisan [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=342.14s)]
*  So I I don't know what the right thing to do is like I don't know protesting is I don't know if sitting there is [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=343.5s)]
*  Just it's tough because it's hard to feel because we don't have a lot of power [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=347.62s)]
*  It's worth remembering though when MTG Marjorie Taylor green interrupted Joe Biden [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=350.02s)]
*  He then had that back and forth with her though [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=353.65999999999997s)]
*  He looked really strong and like like he was kind of sharp and you know [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=355.41999999999996s)]
*  Making light of it kind of making fun of her a bit. Yeah, it was a good moment for him [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=360.3s)]
*  And you know, I don't know if MTG keep standing and won't sit down and keep screaming [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=364.3s)]
*  Maybe the sergeant of arms kicks her out, but I do think Dan's point is right that it did look a little authoritarian in the moment [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=369.58000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, but he also didn't like Marjorie didn't she sat down Al Green didn't the thing is also Trump didn't have like a whole exchange [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=375.54s)]
*  He kind of didn't know you're just like get her out. Yeah, it just [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=381.58000000000004s)]
*  Not to go to all day no Dale on this but everything Al Green's right [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=384.98s)]
*  There is no mandate for Medicaid cuts and what Trump said about his mandate was fucking absurd [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=389.22s)]
*  Yeah [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=394.62s)]
*  I mean getting up there your president United States getting up there to talk about the seven swing states [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=395.18s)]
*  You won the popular vote saying that the president who was before you was the worst president in history [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=400.14s)]
*  Like that that doesn't rate high on the decorum scale [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=404.82s)]
*  Donald Trump's popular vote margin is smaller than every popular vote winner since Al Gore in 2000 [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=408.74s)]
*  Joe by Hillary Clinton won the popular vote in 2016 by more than Joe Biden did in [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=414.9s)]
*  2024 he's sick to violent mob in the Capitol [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=420.58s)]
*  The Donald Trump did in 2024 yeah, he's sick to violent mob at the Capitol [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=423.3s)]
*  What are we doing none of this like it's? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=429.42s)]
*  Was it effective was it not effective? It doesn't matter. It's where we're like wait [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=432.18s)]
*  We're through the looking-glass now Al Green getting kicked out or not. It's like it's not even who cares [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=436.06s)]
*  I think but well, I guess the reason it's like I I know I have the same like we're through the looking-glass man [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=440.9s)]
*  It's like okay. Well, what do we what should they do? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=445.2s)]
*  We're on the other side of the looking-glass. We're on the wrong side of the fucking mirror. We're still here [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=447.65999999999997s)]
*  So what do we do all day? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=451.38s)]
*  You stand up you get kicked out or you don't like I really don't think either matters [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=453.38s)]
*  I don't think it either has an effect. I don't think we're gonna remember this [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=457.52s)]
*  Much longer is I guess with my points, okay? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=460.9s)]
*  So then he keeps going he does the accomplishments does the accomplishments he gets to and then he gets to doge [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=463.74s)]
*  and when he gets to doge first of all he says that [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=470.3s)]
*  Elon Musk is the head of doge which is interesting because in court they're arguing that he was not the head of doge [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=474.18s)]
*  He's just support staff. That's what he said at the cabinet meeting. So some plaintiffs in a lawsuit immediately [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=480.38s)]

*  To the court and saying oh by the way Donald Trump the president just said that Elon Musk is head of doge [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=487.9s)]
*  And then he went through some of the the doge cuts [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=493.06s)]
*  40 million dollars to improve the social and economic inclusion of sedentary [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=497.06s)]
*  Migrants nobody knows what that is eight million dollars to promote [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=502.94s)]
*  LGBTQ I plus [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=507.98s)]

*  And eight million to turn them back [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=532.38s)]
*  And [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=534.38s)]
*  Some of those mice by the way what's so fucking terrible is that some of those trans mice [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=536.9s)]
*  Then like kind of defeated a bunch of other mice in all these mazes [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=542.62s)]
*  And it's like is that fair to have trans mice competing against cisgender mice [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=547.42s)]
*  You know it was nice is that he brought one of those trans mice to the state of the union that was sitting right next to [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=552.7s)]
*  Melania. Yeah made him head of the Park Service [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=557.08s)]
*  And that's all you need to know about speech [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=560.94s)]
*  Sign the EO right there [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=564.38s)]
*  Yeah, so first of all like I haven't looked all this up. I'm guessing a lot of that probably isn't true [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=568.7s)]
*  The reason I know that is not just because I'm guessing then he did the long thing about Social Security where he [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=575.9s)]
*  Repeated the whole thing about like 150 year olds and 300 year olds getting benefits and this and that none of which is true [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=581.78s)]
*  Not only has it been fact-checked by like every media organization [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=588.62s)]
*  But Donald Trump's head of Social Security the administration that the person that's now the administrator after everyone else resigned was like oh by the way [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=591.86s)]
*  200 year olds aren't getting Social Security that wasn't so like even his own administration has that that's wrong [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=599.86s)]
*  Yeah, and he just went through the whole thing did the whole thing at 200 year olds are getting this and this which went on and on [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=604.46s)]
*  I'm like five minutes [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=609.7s)]
*  The doge cuts that he mentioned are probably not accurate either, but I don't know what you guys thought about that [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=612.2600000000001s)]
*  It's just a bunch of people who don't have a date of death associated with their record [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=616.4200000000001s)]
*  Getting benefits, you know, they're just making this part up and and the Mozambique grant for circumcision was [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=619.62s)]
*  To a nonprofit to to do HIV and AIDS prevention like you can explain all these things. It just takes time [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=625.9000000000001s)]
*  I mean ultimately all of these battles over government spending is [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=631.5s)]
*  about specifics and who can get the more evocative examples and [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=636.46s)]
*  Like probably even though it's mostly bullshit [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=639.98s)]
*  This was one of the more effective parts of the speech for Trump is gonna go up there and listen a bunch of programs that most [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=642.86s)]
*  Americans would be concerned in the in the unfair context in which Trump delivered it because of other taxpayers going to that [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=647.74s)]
*  Then we stand up with our much smaller teeny-tiny megaphone and we talk about all the cuts that are coming from douche [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=654.3s)]
*  Well, not our false signs, but like we have been winning politically the battle over douche because the focus has been on [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=660.22s)]
*  cutting, you know the people in charge of protecting nuclear plants the [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=667.02s)]
*  FAA air traffic controllers and the [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=671.38s)]
*  Headstart Department of Education those sorts of things and that's the battle we're gonna be in for the next year on these budget things [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=674.06s)]
*  Yeah, I mean people go into this [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=678.78s)]
*  thinking that there's a lot of waste and inefficiency in government and [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=681.46s)]
*  So when he lists those programs people are probably like, oh my god, I thought it was bad, but I don't know it was that bad [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=685.26s)]
*  That's probably the normal reaction to that. I'm sure that I know that it was all [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=690.66s)]
*  Bullshit or exaggerated or whatever. It's also look again. This is like, you know [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=695.34s)]
*  Defending these programs is always a trap and it's like fine [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=700.38s)]
*  We live in a world where defending really good things is a trap [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=703.1s)]
*  But a lot of science sounds ridiculous until it makes the world a much better place [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=705.7s)]
*  You could probably go back and describe research into stealth airplanes [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=708.74s)]
*  It's like they're trying to make invisible airplanes so you know you can come for the mice. Yeah. Yeah [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=711.9s)]
*  Well, I'm for a process of assigning grants that allow you to do medical research in all kinds of ways [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=717.1s)]
*  Look, we study all kinds of things in mice before we study them in people and like I'd like of course, of course [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=722.02s)]
*  We did a few of those lines in the in Obama's yeah state of the unions salmon got the nice well [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=727.62s)]
*  What like that right? We were talking about this earlier that it is like a [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=734.58s)]
*  Central conceit of the movie Dave. Yes, and in Dave, right? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=738.82s)]
*  He goes through and he says like we're spending money to convince people they were right to buy a car [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=742.14s)]
*  They already bought it's like isn't the government stupid and that's what the 90s did and now we live in the fucking aftermath [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=746.54s)]
*  Yeah [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=751.7800000000001s)]
*  Stupid 90s. Yeah, here we are [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=753.98s)]
*  Yeah [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=755.9000000000001s)]
*  So it took him a while to get to the central concern of most voters, which is the cost of everything and affordability [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=756.5400000000001s)]
*  He did spend [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=764.58s)]
*  The first issue he talked about in depth was trans athletes a lot about that [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=766.86s)]
*  And then finally somewhere in the 30 minute mark 40 minute mark. I don't know what it was. I lost track [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=771.3000000000001s)]
*  He got into inflation [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=776.5400000000001s)]
*  And he did talk about the price of eggs but surprisingly he blamed it on Joe Biden let's listen [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=779.0999999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=785.42s)]
*  The egg prices out of control [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=790.9399999999999s)]
*  He blamed everything on Joe Biden he ran harder against Joe Biden in that speech than he did in the campaign at times [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=796.62s)]
*  It was constant. Yeah [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=802.66s)]
*  What do we think about the inflation stuff and the cost stuff did he [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=804.86s)]
*  Well, he's just sort of like he he's still in a window where it is like plausible to blame your predecessor [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=808.1s)]
*  Like I think it's ridiculous. It's a it's a we we it's no longer apparently ridiculous and embarrassing to brag about your [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=813.42s)]
*  Political victory and then spend a few minutes blaming your predecessor for all of your problems and like such explicit detail [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=820.86s)]
*  Like I'm in your first speech right used to be that that would have been seen as ridiculous and beneath the office and contemptible [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=827.0s)]
*  But we don't feel those things anymore. I guess but like okay. All right still Joe Biden's fault [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=832.62s)]
*  Is that gonna be true in three months in six months? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=837.7s)]
*  I mean not a guy who's known to lean into challenges [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=839.7s)]
*  That's right. Well, let's see if you can break that record [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=843.3s)]
*  But like, you know, he's he has only been president for a month [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=845.22s)]
*  So he has some leeway to say I'm still taking like that's not not a he's a ridiculous person [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=848.46s)]
*  But that's not a ridiculous position. There's a specific [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=853.38s)]
*  Question of blaming Joe Biden for the price of the current spike in egg prices [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=856.26s)]
*  Right you get lands with people [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=861.5600000000001s)]
*  No, but I don't I think people as we know people are not particularly interested in the cause of inflation [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=863.84s)]
*  They're just mainly interested in blaming the person in charge when it happens [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=868.6800000000001s)]
*  But the bigger issue here for me is [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=871.5600000000001s)]
*  Inflation is the number one issue in the CBS poll [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=875.0s)]
*  80% of people think it should be a top priority for Joe Biden. Sorry [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=881.08s)]
*  People like Joe Biden I should do these things this later [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=885.4000000000001s)]
*  80% 80% of people think that inflation should be a top priority for Donald Trump [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=888.72s)]
*  29% of people think it is a top priority. He spent two minutes on inflation. He said nothing about [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=895.1600000000001s)]
*  lowering the cost of housing [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=900.8000000000001s)]
*  groceries [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=902.84s)]
*  Day-to-day costs that any energy and energy energy [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=904.28s)]
*  Drilling yeah, I mean it did nothing no short-term relief for anyone right now [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=908.32s)]
*  inflation costs are [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=912.32s)]
*  Inflation concerns are going up, you know, there's a [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=914.88s)]
*  Our friend Peter Hanby has something in his puck newsletter tonight about polling of Gen Z men [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=918.12s)]
*  Yeah, and Trump's approval rating on inflation has dropped 14 points in a month [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=923.0400000000001s)]
*  People are souring on the economy on which is what they care about [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=927.88s)]
*  It's what the people who put him in office people who will decide the midterms care about and he did not bother to talk [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=930.2800000000001s)]
*  About it for more than two minutes [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=935.44s)]
*  He basically handwaved to the whole thing and I think that is a massive strategic wonder [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=936.6400000000001s)]
*  Because it kind of speaks to the mentality of the administration and you just can't ignore [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=940.68s)]
*  The main thing that got you elected [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=945.6s)]
*  Yeah, if you really wanted to focus on inflation and take it seriously you would and you wanted to you know [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=947.92s)]
*  Indirectly or even directly blame the last administration say I inherited this mess [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=956.24s)]
*  You know costs were high and now I'm gonna take it seriously and you know, Scott Besson said on [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=960.12s)]
*  This Treasury Secretary said this weekend [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=965.56s)]
*  I think on the Sunday shows we're creating an affordability czar or something like that [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=967.6s)]
*  Which is of course bullshit, but in a state of the union could say that spent [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=972.36s)]
*  Yeah, you can say that you can add some policy around it. You can do this thing [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=976.3199999999999s)]
*  He just he kind of didn't even try. I mean he we'll talk about the tack. He talked about the tax cuts [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=979.68s)]
*  I guess we can talk about that. That's about energy prices. Yeah [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=984.24s)]
*  Yeah, so I guess it but he's but also the tax cuts he's like he did the no tax on tips [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=987.8s)]
*  He did the no tax on overtime no tax on Social Security benefits he added [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=992.24s)]
*  No, the the loans on a car loan the interest on a car loan will be tax deductible [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=996.8000000000001s)]
*  Keep in mind none of this none of that is in the Republican budget that passed [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1002.2800000000001s)]
*  So like it's Trump's party is like maybe they'll get in later [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1008.2800000000001s)]
*  Maybe the Senate will do it but none of the stuff that he talked about [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1010.76s)]
*  The tax cuts for like actual working people middle-class people are in the budget that passed [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1013.5200000000001s)]
*  It's like largely tax cuts for rich people. Yeah, and the taxing interest on car loans look like a very regressive. Yes [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1018.36s)]
*  And just like all of these things no tax on tip the Social Security [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1025.44s)]
*  Making Social Security tax deductible all these things are [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1029.64s)]

*  I know we say that about everything with Trump, but like I don't know prices getting jacked up that high for a long time [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1389.9s)]
*  seems [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1395.22s)]
*  Yeah, it absolutely [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1396.26s)]
*  Is deeply politically dangerous for him because it gets at the but he has steps [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1399.5s)]
*  He is like when inflation was Biden you could talk about all these other things that were but he has decided to make a specific [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1405.5800000000002s)]
*  Policy decision that he has talked about he says it's his favorite word in the English language to make your costs higher and [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1412.3000000000002s)]
*  Will he stick with it? That's an open question. He does not he tends to run at the first sign of distress [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1418.2199999999998s)]
*  So we'll see we'll see what happens here [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1423.6399999999999s)]
*  He did stick the Chinese tariffs in his first term stuck with him the whole way [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1424.9399999999998s)]
*  But they were more targeted than this they're more targeted and then he had to spend all of the money and then some that [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1428.4199999999998s)]
*  Be from the tariffs [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1433.34s)]
*  He didn't exempt energy from Canada so like gas prices are gonna [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1435.9399999999998s)]
*  They were the energy tariffs are only 10% not 25 which is based on lobbying from the oil industry [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1441.3s)]
*  Right, but it's still like energy [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1446.34s)]
*  Went up and it's not just about it's not just about what we import what we import like if you you know [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1448.6200000000001s)]
*  He's obsessed with this trade deficit [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1454.18s)]
*  We have a trade deficit with Canada because of oil because we use an incredible amount of oil that comes from Canada [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1456.26s)]
*  You put that aside. We have a trade surplus with Canada. Canada is our biggest customer. They are our biggest client [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1461.34s)]
*  They buy a ton of stuff from us like they are a customer right for everything put oil aside [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1466.74s)]
*  They are a customer we need them in terms of what we trade they buy more from us than we buy from them [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1471.78s)]
*  Which means we need them and so it's all it's all farce. That's why you know, Canada's like fuck you, you know [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1477.5s)]
*  So yeah, I like I don't know how bad this has to get [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1483.5s)]
*  What kind of like whether he wants a fig leaf on this? [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1486.7s)]
*  I do think if he if he does if he does lift it like that's the thing [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1488.78s)]
*  It's if he now lifts it really quickly [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1492.08s)]
*  He looks pretty weak for having put it on for a couple of days and like so these tariffs were always more powerful for him [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1493.9s)]
*  Perspectively than they are now that they're in place. So I just have no idea. I also think that [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1499.6200000000001s)]
*  Like the polling on this, you know [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1505.3s)]
*  You get some polls that show that people are somewhat favorable to tariffs on China and Chinese goods [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1508.06s)]
*  But the Canadian tariffs are very unpopular. Mexico is pretty unpopular like these they're not popular now [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1514.88s)]
*  They're gonna be even less popular when people are paying a lot more for shit [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1522.1200000000001s)]
*  We'll see how the stock market does but like I think this is crazy [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1525.78s)]
*  I don't get the end game but like this is what he's been promising to do for a long time [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1529.66s)]
*  Yeah, it's the only thing he talks about he's relentless. He's hell-bent [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1533.28s)]
*  So it's like it doesn't make sense, but I think he's gonna keep doing it because why build up a bunch of nonsense and then stop? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1536.34s)]
*  I just yeah, that's why I don't get it. Well also and you know, maybe he reduces the Canada and Mexico ones [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1542.46s)]
*  but he spoke at length in the State of the Union tonight about [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1548.1399999999999s)]
*  The reciprocal tariffs that are going going to affect on April 2nd [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1552.06s)]
*  Not April 1st because he didn't want everyone to think it was an April Fool's joke [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1555.7s)]
*  That's what he said like the tariffs on Canada are ostensibly because fentanyl is coming across the border [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1559.44s)]
*  That's just completely made up point two percent of all seizures of fentanyl come across the Canadian border [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1564.22s)]
*  All of it is coming from Mexico. So why the fuck are we terrifying these people? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1569.62s)]
*  He can't explain it and Trudeau took a bunch of steps to try to address his concerns [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1572.5s)]
*  They named the fentanyl czar they spent a bunch of money [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1576.38s)]
*  They put like black hawk helicopters on the border and drones and like all tariff them anyway, so fucking stupid [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1578.38s)]
*  It's like he made up a fake problem [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1584.7s)]
*  Canada has to then make up a fake solution to the fake problem [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1586.8200000000002s)]
*  I know and then we still get the tariffs which have real consequences. Yeah, it's crazy [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1590.0200000000002s)]
*  So then he gets into starts talking about the rest of the world [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1594.14s)]
*  I guess that was a segue talking about Canada and Mexico and the tariffs [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1596.94s)]
*  And you know, he had a little bit to say about all the important problems in the world right now [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1601.3000000000002s)]
*  And I also have a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1606.82s)]
*  We strongly support your right to determine your own future, but we need it really for international world security [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1613.02s)]
*  And I think we're gonna get it one way or the other we're gonna get it the United States has sent [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1620.98s)]
*  hundreds of billions of dollars to support [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1627.6599999999999s)]
*  Ukraine's defense [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1631.3799999999999s)]
*  Do you want to keep it going for another five years? Yeah. Yeah, you you would say Pocahontas says yes a [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1633.6200000000001s)]
*  Lot of things are happening in the Middle East people have been talking about that so much [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1642.46s)]
*  Lately with everything going on with Ukraine and Russia, but a lot of things are happening in the Middle East's [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1646.9s)]
*  Rough neighborhood actually that was the Gaza section is in depth [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1653.3000000000002s)]
*  Yes, they're a lot well made this point [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1656.9s)]
*  That like if you showed this to Republicans five ten years ago and said this is gonna be what you'll be applauding [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1658.82s)]
*  I feel like you're you're full of shit. No fucking way. This is the dumbest shit [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1663.8600000000001s)]
*  I've ever seen they're gonna get Greenland one way or the other [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1667.06s)]
*  Attacked Elizabeth Warren [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1671.06s)]
*  On Ukraine and then Middle East is tough neighborhood [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1673.42s)]
*  I mean is you know [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1676.46s)]
*  As you guys know with speech writers like the amount of time spent on an issue in the State of Union is in the [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1677.9s)]
*  administration size like [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1683.66s)]
*  Directly proportionate to how much we care about it and so by that definition his top foreign policy priority is [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1685.3s)]
*  Get agreement. Yeah, well, it's probably right we didn't get there, but that he also talked about getting the Panama Canal back as well [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1692.46s)]
*  Yeah, well he he's talking about getting the Panama Canal back and then that that segued into [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1699.02s)]
*  some some some love for his Secretary of State [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1706.46s)]
*  Let's hear that clip and we have Marco Rubio in charge. Good luck Marco [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1709.7s)]
*  Now [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1715.54s)]
*  We know who to blame if anything goes wrong [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1716.86s)]
*  Marco's been amazing and he's gonna do a great job think of it. He got a hundred votes [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1720.78s)]
*  You know, he was approved with actually 99 but and I'm either very very happy about that or I'm very concerned about it [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1728.18s)]
*  The bar on the Panama Canal keeps changing. Do we want the full canal? [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1735.18s)]
*  I thought we just wanted cheaper rates or maybe to pass through for free before I was about Chinese influence [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1738.74s)]
*  But today this Hong Kong based holding company that owned two ports on either side of the canal sold them to Blackrock [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1745.14s)]
*  So I thought he was gonna take the win on that. I [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1750.26s)]
*  Thought I was gonna do more on that too when I saw that story right like he even talked about that story [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1752.98s)]
*  It seems like it seems like he's getting what he wants before it became a little thing [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1757.18s)]
*  That was a great I thought it was perfectly time for the state of the Union. That's why they rolled it out [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1760.74s)]
*  I thought Rubio shout-out was notable because I think that Rubio is his patsy on foreign policy [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1764.38s)]
*  And like when things I mean he said it tonight and I think he means it when things go wrong [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1770.1000000000001s)]
*  He's gonna blame it on her out. Yeah [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1774.78s)]
*  Marco Rubio and so like, you know his planned and annexation of Panama Canada [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1777.06s)]
*  Greenland Gaza. Yeah, it's all it's all on Marco. My girl fucks it up and that's it [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1783.1399999999999s)]
*  There were a couple stories about [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1786.82s)]
*  Rubio feeling like you know, he's got his MAGA minders around him and there was another story about how he's [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1788.7s)]
*  Worried that he's not getting the influence [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1794.22s)]
*  He thought he was gonna have and part of me thought this was a little bit [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1796.02s)]
*  Donald Trump at least seeing those or hearing about those and kind of like [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1798.62s)]
*  Bucking him up, you know kind of giving a little shine in the state of the Union [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1801.82s)]
*  I felt like it was Michael Corleone kissing Fredo [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1804.86s)]
*  Like [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1810.86s)]
*  You know, maybe Middle East is a tough neighborhood covers it but the Gaza ceasefire is currently falling apart [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1812.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Israel is currently blockading all aid shipments into Gaza. Things are not on a good trajectory [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1817.3s)]
*  You might talk about it in a normal presidency [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1824.7s)]
*  I would have taken that the absence of talking about his Trump would normally tout [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1828.34s)]
*  His role and getting that ceasefire as evidence that they think it's falling apart [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1833.4599999999998s)]
*  But who the really fuck knows here like they just decided I want to talk about it [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1838.06s)]
*  right [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1842.26s)]
*  why not take the win on getting the ceasefire getting the hostages back and then using it as a moment to like [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1842.76s)]
*  Get everyone in that chamber to applaud for whatever you say about Israel and condemn Hamas [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1848.74s)]
*  That's where you could have gotten everyone on their feet and just hold on to your seat here [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1853.7s)]
*  But what if he actually used the speech to send a message about what he wanted? [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1857.82s)]
*  Right is that is the one take away from the entire speeches at no point [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1861.02s)]
*  Is he using the speech to try to accomplish anything? Right? I think he sent a pretty powerful message to the Danes [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1864.26s)]
*  The Danes would be the example the day the days are shit in their fucking pants right now [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1870.22s)]
*  He started that section on Greenland by saying [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1873.94s)]
*  We support whatever the people of Greenland want to do but we're gonna get you one way [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1876.98s)]
*  Yeah, that's how we ended it and there was some stuff in between about he's gonna take green to new heights [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1882.26s)]
*  Yeah, initially we made that that [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1888.02s)]
*  Trump Trump Greenland and that obvious notice when he first mentioned Greenland JD Vance and speaker Johnson kind of start chuckling and then by the end [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1893.3s)]
*  They're like, oh they're excited [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1900.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1903.7s)]
*  That's it's real he really he's it's one way or the other [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1905.8600000000001s)]
*  So that was foreign policy and then he did a bunch of he called out people in the guest box [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1909.6399999999999s)]
*  He does that a couple stunts [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1913.66s)]
*  What else stood out to you guys in the speech and then there was like an there was like five endings [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1916.32s)]
*  There were like literally copy pasted from other Trump speeches [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1920.28s)]
*  It's about like crossing new frontiers and going to the moon and all that bullshit [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1923.84s)]
*  We should talk about the stunts a little bit. Yeah, some of the some of the stunts, right? [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1929.0s)]
*  So we had there was one moment [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1932.24s)]
*  That was actually like kind of sweet where there's this boy that had had some kind of cancer and is like wanted to be a police officer [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1934.9199999999998s)]
*  And clearly they didn't know how long he was gonna live [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1941.8s)]
*  So he became honorary police officer and then he made him an honorary member of the Secret Service and he had a really sweet [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1943.8799999999999s)]
*  Look on his face and I found that moving and then some more cynical people ripped me to fucking pieces [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1948.72s)]
*  But then it became and actually RFK jr [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1954.48s)]
*  Is gonna look into the to the to the chemical causes of various illnesses and by the way [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1957.9399999999998s)]
*  Then he was like the cancer might have been from you like insinuated that it came from chemicals [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1963.0400000000002s)]
*  Which which ma has got to fix and then we got to go to autism [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1967.8400000000001s)]
*  It was a really weird and then you remember that he's currently gutting the National Institutes of Health [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1970.6000000000001s)]
*  That's where the transgender mice research was done [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1976.52s)]
*  But also some cancer research that you might have been familiar with and he's going after medicated. He's going after [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1978.72s)]
*  and by the way, he [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1985.2800000000002s)]
*  Launched an insurrection against the police at the Capitol in which this event was taking place [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1987.0800000000002s)]
*  Yes, it is a cynical thing but the moment it did work on me he did admit one guy to West Point to yeah [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1991.4s)]
*  That was good. That was good, too. I'm gonna rank the stunts. I can't remember [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=1997.56s)]
*  specifics, but I remember him doing this in [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2002.68s)]
*  Like his previous state of the union's is for during his first terms [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2005.36s)]
*  Like they weren't just calling out people in the box when the first lady's box [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2008.76s)]
*  It was like like announcing something. Yeah, or some kind of award. It gets it's not just the rush limbaugh. It's very over right here, right? [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2012.8799999999999s)]
*  Yes, it is. Yeah, you sign an executive order [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2019.32s)]
*  Yeah, Jay Jay Mark called it his Ed McMahon section of the speech really dated cultural reference even for us [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2021.56s)]
*  Yeah, and then there was like the slightly there was that not slightly then there was like the darker version of it [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2026.8799999999999s)]
*  Right, which is like kind of going through people that have been grievously harmed by whether it's immigrants or a trans athlete [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2031.8799999999999s)]
*  And then like naming a national [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2038.12s)]
*  Preserve after the victim of a terrible murder and like to draw attention to you know [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2039.96s)]
*  Anti-immigrant sentiment and all the rest so like that was that was pretty ugly [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2045.0s)]
*  But like the most I mean because a lot of the speech was like sort of a mix of yes, it's sort of normal [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2048.12s)]
*  Normal speeches as president and his stump speeches or grievance some speech like the kind of the parts that did stand out other than [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2054.16s)]
*  like a Greenland was [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2059.58s)]
*  Were these stunts? [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2061.64s)]
*  Only time Medicaid was mentioned the entire night was Al Green nice [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2063.52s)]
*  Donald Trump never mentioned Medicaid or Medicare [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2068.64s)]
*  Which I thought was kind of interesting like he did usually he'd do the I'm gonna protect it [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2070.96s)]
*  I'm not gonna cut it in this budget, but he didn't even mention it all [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2075.68s)]
*  I mean [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2078.68s)]
*  I guess it is noteworthy that if he does not pass a tax cut bill taxes will go up on nearly every American and [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2079.16s)]
*  He is there's a very challenging thing to do even though it's not a nice to have it [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2085.52s)]
*  Yeah, it is a must-do it is absolute must-do and I would also say embedded in that exact bill is the [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2089.22s)]
*  bill to lift the debt limit so he has to [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2095.8399999999997s)]
*  in order if he does not pass this bill we're gonna default and everyone's gonna get a tax increase and [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2099.48s)]
*  He has Congress before him he is a massively divided Republican Party [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2103.76s)]
*  they are divided on both the policy the [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2107.6200000000003s)]
*  Spending measures to pay for this and the legislative process to accomplish it [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2111.4s)]
*  He used none of this speech with all of them there to try to rally them to any sort of cause [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2115.8s)]
*  He talked a little bit about this tax cut [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2120.3s)]
*  But like they have no plan to solve this problem [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2122.36s)]
*  And he did he was not he cannot be bothered to try to get into the minutia of trying to pass a bill well [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2125.1200000000003s)]
*  But it makes sense when you realize that he is not trying to make a case [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2130.96s)]
*  That wins him any kind of public opinion [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2135.6000000000004s)]
*  He's not trying to pressure these people in public because what the White House does what this White House does is [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2137.84s)]
*  Just like threaten them in private and so he probably thinks I'm gonna talk about my accomplishments and have a good time [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2143.8s)]
*  And I'm gonna deal with getting the sausage made with my people on my own right I think part right [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2149.32s)]
*  I also it's just like it's sort of it's an unsolvable problem [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2154.1800000000003s)]
*  There's no like a rhetorical fix for it like the circles in the Venn diagram do not overlap like Tom Cotton stood up at some [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2157.04s)]
*  Senate Republican caucus meeting today, and it's like hey guys like we're far apart from what the house wants to do [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2162.16s)]
*  We're talking about all these tax cuts for the rich [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2166.68s)]
*  We got to focus on the parts that are for the working class like there's like a real [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2168.04s)]
*  Well, there's a this this there's no solve right now for this. What's he gonna say? Yes? He's not persuading people to anything and it's because [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2171.24s)]
*  Thune said before Tom Cotton got up the house is asking for a trillion dollars in cuts [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2177.36s)]
*  We've never done that in a reconciliation bill like I could see for the most we've done is like [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2183.1600000000003s)]
*  $400 billion in cuts and I I still think that they are gonna try to [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2188.6400000000003s)]
*  the easiest thing for them to do is not go deep on the cuts and [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2194.04s)]
*  Say that the bullshit doge cuts [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2198.1600000000003s)]
*  You know puff them up and lie about how much money they saved do a huge tax cut [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2201.12s)]
*  Because they can get everyone on board with that figure something out about the debt limit [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2205.92s)]
*  And look maybe he's gonna fucking mint the coin or get rid of the debt limiter say it doesn't matter and then just pass something [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2210.28s)]
*  That just you know adds to the deficit a couple trillion dollars gives rich people a tax cut and then cuts where they can [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2215.84s)]
*  That feels like the the way that they'd get out of this or the whole thing falls apart. Yes, I [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2222.0800000000004s)]
*  Just you would typically use that moment to at least express urgency as people to get your shit together [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2227.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah in that moment and you're right like maybe the old there is no solution here [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2232.92s)]
*  That does not involve a large swath of the Republicans voting for something [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2238.52s)]
*  They swore they would never vote for one way or the other right? Oh, I'm going for it paid for a cut Medicaid [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2241.96s)]
*  Don't cut Medicaid [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2246.52s)]
*  Or they can just fucking lie and just put some you know do some gimmick in there about yes the doge cuts [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2248.08s)]
*  But say like we're gonna do this amount of cuts in the coming years, right? [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2253.96s)]
*  Like they can do some some trickery with math [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2256.56s)]
*  Well, they could also sunset some of the tax cuts to keep the costs of a certain way down, right? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2258.62s)]
*  Push it push a decision on tax cuts like, you know do cuts over ten years do the tax cuts over three [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2262.44s)]
*  Like there's like there's games they still have room to play with but even when they get to that [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2266.9s)]
*  There's still a massive Delta between the money going out the money coming in. Yeah [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2269.94s)]
*  Yeah, right and they can't they can do all their games, but that's someone's gonna report math is math [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2274.04s)]

*  I thought it was really weird when he had cash Patel his new FBI director stand up and get [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2452.14s)]
*  Standing ovation it just felt like the Praetorian Guard was all in the room and we were supposed to see them [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2459.06s)]
*  It just bothered me a lot. Yeah, he also called out Pam Bondi a few times. Yep [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2464.7s)]
*  She's gonna get she's gonna get the dead people collecting Social Security that don't exist, right? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2468.7s)]
*  She's gonna arrest a spreadsheet. I guess with some names on it of dead people filing error [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2472.7799999999997s)]
*  Anything else we get to the that we talk about the Democratic response. Oh, yeah the Democrats was the slock in [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2478.18s)]
*  New senator from Michigan [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2483.38s)]
*  She gave the Democratic response and then there were other Democratic responses we already talked about Al Green [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2484.66s)]
*  Leaving there was also a bunch of Democrats that held signs up that said false [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2490.74s)]
*  They were dressed in different ways and then a bunch of people's just a couple people left the speech [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2495.02s)]
*  So some came back but yeah [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2499.7999999999997s)]
*  I was gonna say like I think Maxwell Frost and someone else left early and then later Bernie left [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2501.8599999999997s)]
*  And then a couple other people left like it was sort of us. Yeah, there was no like specific words that triggered them leaving [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2507.18s)]
*  I think if I were them I would have left just because I was very bored and it was very long and I was tired [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2512.86s)]
*  You know, we're in West Coast time and we're tired. Yeah, we've really like walking out of a movie just to show you hate it [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2517.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I walked out of a pretty bad production of rent once but it wasn't a protest [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2522.94s)]
*  I just was it and wasn't a good production. I was ready to go home [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2526.54s)]
*  I think Elizabeth's lock-in did a good job. I think it like those speeches are the hardest ones to give of any speech [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2529.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't even know why people still do state of the response [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2536.1400000000003s)]
*  They are remembered if you fuck up and if you do well, they're not remembered [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2539.1800000000003s)]
*  I think it was it was short. She delivered it well and she like hit the message that I'm sure is going to [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2543.1800000000003s)]
*  Pull well, like I bet it I bet it probably did what the speech did well with whatever focus groups of voters [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2551.1400000000003s)]
*  We're watching it and then there's this debate that's happening online right now about like should should the Democrats have gone at all? [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2556.26s)]
*  Should they not have gone at all which we sort of started talking about this lock-in thing [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2562.42s)]
*  If I were to offer her advice I would say ditch the cliches we don't need to say things are as American as apple pie [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2565.8999999999996s)]
*  I would say if you can do the setting over again have some people there give it some energy [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2571.62s)]
*  Not just sort of in a random room. I agree. She delivered it really well. It was tight. It had a message [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2575.22s)]
*  It was coherent [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2580.7s)]
*  It was just like a little bit [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2581.5s)]
*  It felt like it was from a pre Trump era and I think in the post Trump era [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2582.8199999999997s)]
*  Like we all need to think about ways to really get people's attention and make a speech [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2587.2599999999998s)]
*  Memorable in a way that will go viral on tik-tok and Instagram and be seen by more people than whoever's still watching MSNBC [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2591.6s)]
*  it's an interesting thing because [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2598.8s)]
*  It is it is a format optimized for the free television time, right? [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2601.2000000000003s)]
*  Because you are the networks carry they all carry it and so more people will see [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2605.48s)]
*  a list a list of lock-in speech than any speech given by a Democrat this year by a factor of [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2609.8s)]
*  10 15 20 more maybe [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2614.2400000000002s)]
*  In full on television in full on television, right? [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2617.24s)]
*  But if you were trying to moderate and communicate you would not give a 10 minute to camera response you would [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2620.24s)]
*  Well, I'm in a podcast interview or whatever or like a conversation. Yeah, I mean like there's yeah [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2625.96s)]
*  I think there's are three things one if you're gonna go all the way to [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2630.2799999999997s)]
*  Michigan to deliver it like why are you standing in front of like a kind of a standard American flag set that could have been [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2635.12s)]
*  Closed room anywhere. So I sort of like didn't understand the setting. I thought the speech was [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2641.52s)]
*  Solid but like I and it's not even a criticism of her or the speech. It's like yes [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2645.18s)]
*  There's the question of like well, you know, this is it's it's a it's a television format not a social media format [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2649.14s)]
*  But then there's just this this part of it [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2654.7799999999997s)]
*  I don't have an answer but it's like we just watched a carnival barker lie and kind of squeal for 90 minutes [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2656.58s)]
*  vilifying all kinds of people [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2663.7s)]
*  Willfully lying making things up about Social Security kind of attacking president bragging about his electoral record [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2665.62s)]
*  Just showing like utter contempt for the country and then we do kind of what is the kind of the adults in the room? [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2672.46s)]
*  Standard here's the response the message that tests. Well the the the proper Reagan references [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2679.9s)]
*  Right land just sort of like this is designed to meet but that to appeal to a broad range of people [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2685.54s)]
*  We do normal politics [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2690.7400000000002s)]
*  and [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2692.82s)]
*  I don't know like what the alternative to that is that works, but there is just something dissonant about it [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2693.94s)]
*  Something wrong about it like Donald Trump does what Donald Trump does and then we get up there and we do what we would do [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2699.78s)]
*  if Mitt Romney had won or if [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2704.7000000000003s)]
*  if if [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2707.02s)]
*  Marco Rubio had won or whatever and I idea I know and I and I think the challenge is [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2708.5800000000004s)]
*  Half the country thinks that we are in normal politics [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2716.46s)]
*  right the guys got a you know approval rating of at worst depending on the poll you look at 45% best 51 50% [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2719.6200000000003s)]
*  so that's like a whole bunch of people who [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2727.2200000000003s)]
*  if she had gotten up there any Democrat had get up there and said something like [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2729.3799999999997s)]
*  This is a moment of urgency and can you believe that or just that guy was crazy or he was a carnival barker all the stuff [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2733.3399999999997s)]
*  That we've been saying [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2739.22s)]
*  With a lot of people would land like yeah, I don't know what here's the thing I'd say about that [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2740.2999999999997s)]
*  I know that's what I'm saying so like that like I think there could be room for that [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2744.3399999999997s)]
*  But then the question is what is the goal of a response? [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2747.3399999999997s)]
*  Like this gets to the heart of like the entire Democratic response the people on the floor Al Green everything else like [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2750.7799999999997s)]
*  What is the goal of what we are trying to do? [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2755.7799999999997s)]
*  In responding to Donald Trump's speech and who are we trying to reach and who we trying to convince [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2759.2599999999998s)]
*  So there's a there's a big dilemma here, which is [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2763.18s)]
*  Without fail the best testing messages the ones that show up as most persuasive [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2766.4199999999996s)]
*  Feel incredibly small ball compared to what's happening here and not that cutting Medicaid is small ball [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2772.18s)]
*  Because that is a devastating thing for so many people, but it just like we we're on the brink of [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2777.8399999999997s)]
*  Authoritarianism in this country and it feels like we're just using the same message [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2785.7000000000003s)]
*  We use against Mitt Romney in 2012 doesn't seem like the right feel here [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2789.38s)]
*  But the polling is crystal clear the one piece of advice that I would give to Democrats [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2792.46s)]
*  I've been wrestling with the wrestling with this myself for the last couple weeks here is there is no election tomorrow [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2797.5s)]
*  The next day. Yes, there's not even with their elections in November, but they are state elections [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2803.54s)]
*  We do not have to respond to how people think about Donald Trump right now [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2809.08s)]
*  We have to make how people think about Donald Trump be different by November of 2026, right and that I think is [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2812.92s)]
*  Be is a I think that implores us to step away [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2819.88s)]
*  From the quote-unquote best testing message right now and do a little bit more what I think Chris Murphy is doing which is to [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2824.04s)]
*  Be a little more sort of [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2829.66s)]
*  just sort of authentically ranting about the dangers that are happening and [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2832.48s)]
*  Like this is this is the fundamental difference between Democrats Republicans is [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2837.28s)]
*  Democrats find out where we're voters are and then we try to meet them there and Republicans try to get the voters to where they [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2841.0s)]
*  Want them to be and I think we have to we have to just think a little bigger here play a bigger game [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2846.56s)]
*  Let me have been playing I think then I [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2852.44s)]
*  Feel like I feel like I'm going crazy having this debate over and over again because we like keep going on both sides of it like [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2855.36s)]
*  Kamala Harris loses the election and we're all like there's too much democracy too much scary this that the other thing [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2862.88s)]
*  Authoritarianism people don't care about that should have talked more about cost inflation stuff like that and then okay great [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2868.94s)]
*  So now all the Democrats are like we got to talk about the price of eggs [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2874.84s)]
*  We've got to drive a message about inflation. We got to talk about cost and then [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2877.34s)]
*  Donald Trump does what he does over the last month and it's like we can't fucking talk about that. We have to see and I'm [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2881.26s)]
*  There I'm like we have to talk about time with I would talk I would respond to it like Chris Murphy's first down [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2886.1400000000003s)]
*  But I think this is where this is how you square the difference though [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2890.58s)]
*  I [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2893.18s)]
*  Come on Harris been a very difficult position because she only had a hundred days like [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2894.42s)]
*  She couldn't like a third of the country completely woke up to the threat of Trump a third likes it a third was more concerned about [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2898.2599999999998s)]
*  Their daily experience what was happening their lives and waking them up to the threat democracy just wasn't gonna happen [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2904.22s)]
*  We didn't have the credibility. She didn't have the credibility, right? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2908.7s)]
*  So you have to camp so that's where the mistake there is right? [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2910.94s)]
*  But now like let's try to wake some more people up right like no [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2913.06s)]
*  Yes, we can talk about the price of eggs, but like we have to I think we should like like yes [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2916.3199999999997s)]
*  I think that we can't just assume that this is static like Donald Trump is an authoritarian threat [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2920.34s)]
*  Not enough people care about that [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2925.54s)]
*  not enough people care when he sides against Ukraine when he pulls all these stunts when he talks about evading Greenland right like [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2926.7400000000002s)]
*  too many people are kind of [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2932.46s)]
*  Inured to it or asleep to it or not paying attention and that's part of why we're in this mess [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2935.0600000000004s)]
*  I think the what like one way that I think also helps square the circle is to start talking about the corruption [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2939.38s)]
*  Like I'm not saying we should use the word kleptocracy to describe this because that is a ridiculous term to use [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2946.02s)]
*  But that is the story here right like we have a bunch of oligarchs running this country [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2950.74s)]
*  We have the world's richest man running through things and the value of corruption as a message is one. It's true [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2955.54s)]
*  Two it allows us if we could get our heads out of our asses to become a reform party again [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2961.5s)]
*  Because we're not trying to defend the status quo [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2966.16s)]
*  We're trying to reform it in a way that actually helps people stuff just burning the fucking thing down and that at least is [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2968.86s)]
*  It's you know [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2974.54s)]
*  There's a pointless a slug and sort of moved around which is is it is it crazy change? [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2976.1s)]
*  That like is chaotic and hurts people or is that yeah real change that can actually help people [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2982.86s)]
*  Yeah, and I thought that was I thought that was strong and I thought and like it's funny because as I listen to that speech [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2987.46s)]
*  I thought the strong part of the speech was the end when she talked about democracy [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2992.2s)]
*  And then there's like the little part of my head [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2996.2s)]
*  It's like probably not the most popular part of the speech [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=2998.12s)]
*  But I was like that's what I feel like that's resonates and it was true [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3000.2s)]
*  You know yeah [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3002.8s)]
*  But I do think part of that too is it's we're so far from an election the Democrats getting up there and saying here's exactly [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3003.44s)]
*  What I'll do at help on the economy just rings a little hollow right now [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3008.0s)]
*  I know you're so we got to get closer to the election where you can have like an agenda like you know [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3011.0s)]
*  You you back up a corruption message with we're gonna make white-collar crime the priority of the Justice Department again like we're gonna [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3014.32s)]
*  Go after these taxis. We're gonna go after the crypto fraudsters [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3019.3s)]
*  Like you need you need like that kind of energy and a kind of list of things that you can do [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3022.1600000000003s)]
*  imagine a version of her speech that is [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3026.1200000000003s)]
*  Entirely focused on Elon Musk in Doge cuts and going through all the mistakes and fuck-ups in great detail like he did like she [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3028.12s)]
*  Did a little bit of this she did the things that we've all been hitting the nuclear weapons people who were fired [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3035.62s)]
*  The Social Security Health Administration, but imagine you tick that's all of that. It's like Doge is this unbelievable threat [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3040.64s)]
*  It's the only thing we should care about here of my focus [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3047.18s)]
*  It's a really interesting idea different because the that's actually really smart way to think about it [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3049.44s)]
*  Which is use that free 10 minutes of national television time and attention you get to try to win one battle not try to win [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3053.84s)]
*  The entire war right? [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3061.1600000000003s)]
*  Impossible task given any any person in any party. Yeah, although the thing I I saw a lot of [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3063.5600000000004s)]
*  Like media outlets and God bless them. This is their job. They're supposed to give us the facts [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3069.1200000000003s)]
*  There's like a lot of fact-checking after the speech and I was like I can't do the fact-checking [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3074.0800000000004s)]
*  I don't think I don't think fact-checking him is I mean, it's helpful to point out that he's bullshit [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3077.48s)]
*  But like I don't know where it's getting us [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3082.3s)]
*  I think there are parts of it like the Social Security thing is very important to point out [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3084.1400000000003s)]
*  Right because you're just gonna have conversations with people like that's the sort of thing that people would be like [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3087.7400000000002s)]
*  You're like even on musk is a fucking nutshell. Look go something's gonna well [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3092.38s)]
*  Yeah, but I heard that they were paying off, you know a million hundred fifty year old Social Security like having the facts to that is [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3095.5s)]
*  A helpful push back. It's it's also by the way like at this point like I agree like these stories specifically [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3100.6000000000004s)]
*  I don't know what they get us [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3105.5s)]
*  But then like we just don't really know or have a good way of measuring like okay [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3106.7400000000002s)]
*  Some creator somewhere is gonna take that and make a tick-tock or make a video that kind of walks through the ways [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3110.2999999999997s)]
*  It was a lies if one of them will take off it will get in front of a lot of people and so I like [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3115.1s)]
*  Well, this is and this is where I was at the beginning where you're talking about greed [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3118.5s)]
*  And I was like a little flippant being like I don't think it matters either way [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3121.3399999999997s)]
*  I guess we're having this debate over like what's the most effective message? What's the most effective Democrat? [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3124.3399999999997s)]
*  I guess like I don't blame any of them for trying right like if you wanted to hold a sign if you wanted to walk [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3129.38s)]
*  Out if you wanted to stay if you want to give a list of Slocken's type speech if you want to do something else [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3135.3399999999997s)]
*  Like whatever like you said the election is not till 2026 [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3139.06s)]
*  Everyone should try some stuff's gonna take off some stuff isn't gonna take off as long as people are like, you know [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3142.3s)]
*  Going out there throwing spaghetti at the wall right now. Yeah, you know time. Yes. See this CNN instant snap poll [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3147.2599999999998s)]
*  Is it let's say 44% very positive reviews of Trump's speech [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfUE_mDSjM&t=3152.68s)]
