Video Description: In the middle of the night, the House narrowly passes Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill," a witch's brew of tax cuts for the wealthiest and benefit cuts for the neediest, sending it on to the Senate. Jon and Dan talk about what Democrats can do to stop the bill—and the upside of Republicans passing something so massively unpopular, Trump's "white genocide" show-and-tell for South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, and the damning new data showing why Kamala Harris lost the 2024 presidential election. Then, Dan talks with Rep. LaMonica McIver about getting slapped with criminal charges by Trump's Justice Department, and what it means for the executive branch to be targeting legislators for doing their job.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Trump Pushes DISASTER Bill and Healthcare Cuts Through Republican House
**Pod Save America:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4)
*  Can we just for one moment just pause on the fact that they call it the one big beautiful bill act? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=0.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=5.36s)]
*  I know it's been a while since Schoolhouse Rocks has been on TV, but it's a bill until it's an act. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  It would have been so easy to just do one big beautiful act. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=12.72s)]
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Jon Favreau. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=15.52s)]
*  I'm Dan Pfeiffer. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=17.68s)]
*  On today's show, we'll talk about the big billionaire welfare bill that just passed the house. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=18.56s)]
*  Trump turning his meeting with South Africa's president into a white genocide media presentation. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=22.88s)]
*  The most corrupt dinner in presidential history that's happening Thursday night. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=29.36s)]
*  And brand new data that finally offers some definitive conclusions about why Democrats [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=33.92s)]
*  came up short in 2024 and who the party has to win back in 2026 and 2028 and beyond. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=38.239999999999995s)]
*  Then Dan talks to New Jersey representative, LaMonica MacGyver, about the Trump administration [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=45.44s)]
*  charging her with two felonies while she was conducting congressional oversight [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=49.44s)]
*  at an immigration detention facility. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=53.44s)]
*  But let's start briefly with the deeply upsetting news on Wednesday night that two staffers at the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=56.559999999999995s)]
*  Israeli embassy in Washington, a couple who were just days away from getting engaged, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=61.12s)]
*  were shot at close range and killed in an anti-Semitic attack outside an event at the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=66.24s)]
*  Capitol Jewish Museum. The gunman, born and raised in Chicago, shouted, free Palestine, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=71.2s)]
*  and posted a manifesto on Twitter titled, Escalate for Gaza, Bring the War Home. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=77.92s)]
*  He has now been charged. The killings were universally condemned by elected officials [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=83.2s)]
*  and activists across the political spectrum. Trump posted his condolences and said that, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  quote, hatred and radicalism have no place in the USA. Though some on the right, like Stephen [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  Miller, White House aide, called it an example of a, quote, growing cancer of far left domestic [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  terrorism. And here's what Republican Congressman Randy Fine said about Gaza when asked about the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=103.04s)]
*  shootings on Fox. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=108.32s)]
*  The fact of the matter is the Palestinian cause is an evil one. So the only end of the conflict [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=109.92s)]
*  is complete and total surrender by those who support Muslim terror. In World War II, we did [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=116.48s)]
*  not negotiate a surrender with the Nazis. We did not negotiate a surrender with the Japanese. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=121.52000000000001s)]
*  We nuked the Japanese twice in order to get unconditional surrender. That needs to be the same here. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=126.48s)]
*  Jesus Christ. So there's still information coming in about the killings since it's early, but [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=133.68s)]
*  what do you think the danger is in this moment beyond some of the gross and offensive takes we [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=142.24s)]
*  have read on the internet and seen on Fox? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=147.60000000000002s)]
*  It's obviously a very deeply disturbing, horrific example of violent anti-Semitism in this country. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  And it's what we have to unite to stop in this country. But what is scary about it in this moment [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=155.6s)]
*  with this president in the White House is that it is things like this, these sensational, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  emotionally evocative, violent events that authoritarians and fascists latch onto to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=171.44s)]
*  use as a pretense for a broad-based oppression or targeting of a certain population. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=178.8s)]
*  So you can see that it is inherent in the language that Stephen Miller used that you quoted, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=186.24s)]
*  that this can be used as a way to go after, as the term administration has frankly already been doing, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=190.8s)]
*  the larger Palestinian rights movement in this country, the larger, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=195.68s)]
*  almost entirely nonviolent, peaceful Palestinian rights movement in this country, as a way to go [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  after foreign students with their visas, to target universities, to target organizations, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=205.28s)]
*  to suppress people's freedom of speech and their freedom of assembly. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=212.16s)]
*  And so this is something you can easily see Trump and his minions latching onto in a very dangerous way. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=215.84s)]
*  Yeah. Anti-Semitism and anti-Semitic attacks have been on the rise for the last decade, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=223.68s)]
*  especially since October 7th, not just from the extreme left, like in this instance, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=231.6s)]
*  from the far right as well. It's also true that people who commit political violence [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=239.28s)]
*  almost always hurt the cause that they purport to care about. That's certainly true for those of us [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=244.95999999999998s)]
*  who believe the massacre of innocent civilians in Gaza is not the answer to the massacre of [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=250.16s)]
*  innocent civilians in Israel on October 7th. Yair Rosenberg wrote a piece in The Atlantic [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=256.0s)]
*  about the killings and had a good line, I thought, neither Palestine nor Israel will ever truly be [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=262.16s)]
*  free until their societies are liberated from megalomaniacal men who perpetrate demonic acts [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=268.0s)]
*  in their name. But as you said, aside from all that, the administration has been cynically [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=273.6s)]
*  exploiting anti-Semitism to further their own authoritarian project. And as you said, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=282.96s)]
*  targeting sort of the pro-Palestinian movement nationwide, but also just anyone who disagrees [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=291.2s)]
*  with them, whether it's about Gaza or not, about any other issue. And so it's universities and [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=295.59999999999997s)]
*  sometimes it's about protests, sometimes it's not about the protests, sometimes it's protests [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=303.2s)]
*  about Gaza, sometimes it's other protests. It's whatever the protest is at the moment. They just [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=306.96s)]
*  don't want people who disagree with the administration to have the freedom to speak out [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=310.72s)]
*  and to organize in this country. And that is becoming very clear. It was clear today when [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=317.20000000000005s)]
*  the Department of Homeland Security sent a letter to Harvard revoking their student exchange and [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=323.92s)]
*  visitor program certification, which means that, to quote DHS in the letter, Harvard can no longer [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=330.32000000000005s)]
*  enroll foreign students and existing foreign students must transfer or lose their legal status. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=336.96s)]
*  There are 6,800 international students at Harvard. That is roughly 27% of the student body. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=343.91999999999996s)]
*  And imagine being one of those students right now. You have to transfer schools [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=351.03999999999996s)]
*  or lose your, or worried about losing your legal status. Now there's a judge in California who [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=358.96s)]
*  issued an injunction on the administration's attempt to remove legal status from international [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=364.88s)]
*  students and it's a nationwide injunction. So unclear if it applies to this case or not. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=369.92s)]
*  I imagine Harvard will also sue in this particular case. And I imagine there'll be an injunction here [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=374.0s)]
*  as well. Otherwise you're going to have a bunch of international students who, if they don't transfer, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=378.96s)]
*  could lose their jobs and potentially lose legal status and be deported. But it's just one example [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=382.8s)]
*  of, you know, the DHS is using the protests and anti-Semitism, but that's not what they really [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=388.8s)]
*  want to do. They just don't like Harvard. Yeah, they want to send a message to people that they [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=393.44s)]
*  view as their enemies. It's disgusting. And you know, for the rest of us, whether it's a cause [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=397.04s)]
*  you care passionately about, whatever side of an issue you're on, recognize that the administration [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=403.04s)]
*  does not want to stop at pro-Palestinian protesters or media people that they don't like or [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=410.88s)]
*  different colleges that they don't like. Unless you are completely in agreement with the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=418.64s)]
*  administration and never speak out against them, you are at risk from this administration. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=424.96s)]
*  If you're one of those people who believed that freedom of speech was a real reason to [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=430.96s)]
*  vote for Donald Trump in 2024, I have some bad news for you. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=437.03999999999996s)]
*  Right. Right. Yeah. What a fucking joke that was. Okay. Biggest news of the week is that in the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=440.71999999999997s)]
*  middle of the night, House Republicans passed Donald Trump's economic plan that gives $1 trillion [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=446.72s)]
*  in tax cuts to the richest 1% of Americans. These are Americans who make over $1 million a year. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=452.08000000000004s)]
*  Just those trillion dollars in tax cuts are paid for by kicking 14 million Americans off their [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=460.16s)]
*  health insurance and cutting food assistance for nearly 11 million people, mostly children. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=465.52000000000004s)]
*  The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which I regret to inform you is the official name of the [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=471.76s)]
*  legislation. I had to look. It's actually on the paper. Would also put nearly 700,000 jobs at risk [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=477.6s)]
*  by gutting clean energy tax credits. Despite all of these cuts, because there's other tax cuts as [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=484.8s)]
*  well, this whole bill would still increase the deficit by $3 trillion, a little over $3 trillion. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=491.68s)]
*  The bill passed by a single vote, 215 to 214. Every single Democrat voted against it. Every [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=499.36s)]
*  single Republican voted for it. And it passed after Republicans made even deeper cuts and changes [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=507.12s)]
*  to win the votes of the hardliners in their caucus, many of whom still aren't happy, but got to yes [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=513.84s)]
*  after a gentle nudge from dear leader himself who said that a no vote would, quote, be the [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=520.4s)]
*  ultimate betrayal. The bill now heads to the Senate where Republicans can only afford to lose [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=527.4399999999999s)]
*  three votes. You said last week it's the Republican moderates who always cave and the hardliners who [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=534.4799999999999s)]
*  always win. What did you think of how this one ended up? That's largely how this played out. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=540.0s)]
*  The moderates who originally wanted very little, very few Medicaid changes, very little cuts to [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=544.9599999999999s)]
*  Medicaid, not people losing their health coverage through Medicaid, ruling a trade all of that away [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=550.4s)]
*  in order to get an increase in the cap for the state and local tax deduction, which mostly benefits [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=555.04s)]
*  wealthy homeowners up to $500,000 income in their states. So they traded that away for that. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=562.88s)]
*  The far right deficit hawks did not get a bill that reduced the deficit, obviously, since they [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=569.36s)]
*  got one that massively increased it. They overshot the runway there by a couple trillion dollars. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=574.88s)]
*  They were just horseshoes and hand grenades, John. They were almost there. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=579.28s)]
*  The bill moved to the right on both Medicaid. They moved forward when the work requirements [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=587.12s)]
*  would go into place to the end of 2026 and made more drastic the cuts to the clean energy [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=592.7199999999999s)]
*  tax incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act, which is something the moderates almost universally [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=599.12s)]
*  opposed. So they gave in on that. We'll see what the final vote is. We'll talk about what comes [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=604.48s)]
*  next in the final passage of this vote. But the fact that it passed by one vote means that every [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=609.76s)]
*  single vulnerable Republican, every one of those people in a purple district or the ones who want [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=614.16s)]
*  to district the Kamala Harris one, were the deciding vote for this bill. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=618.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I think that the conflict between the hardliners and the moderates was much less [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=621.36s)]
*  important than the role of Donald Trump here. I think these Republican politicians, they still [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=627.84s)]
*  have their own views about policy and they may even vote according to those views when a Democratic [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=635.36s)]
*  president is in office. But when Donald Trump is in office, the most important policy view, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=642.08s)]
*  the most important policy position that you have as a Republican is whatever the fuck Donald Trump [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=648.64s)]
*  believes. And the fact that he could go in there and tell the hardliners, oh, you're all pissed, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=654.4s)]
*  you're all threatening to vote it down if it doesn't cut the deficit more, if we don't have [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=659.92s)]
*  deeper cuts, fuck you. You're voting for the bill until the moderates, oh, you're worried about [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=663.52s)]
*  losing. Whatever. You lose, you lose. But let me tell you, you're going to have a primary if you [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=668.16s)]
*  don't get on board this. They're all just, they'll do whatever he says. It's a call the personality [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=673.76s)]
*  is the party and they all bend the knee to one person and that person has an entirely incoherent [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=680.64s)]
*  and uneducated set of policy priorities. He doesn't really know what he wants. He just [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=686.56s)]
*  wants wins. It doesn't matter what the win is, it doesn't matter what the cost is. And he believes [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=690.4s)]
*  he can lie about it. He can lie about the deficit, he can lie about the Medicaid cuts and lie about [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=694.08s)]
*  all of it and get away with it. So all he cares about is his win. What it takes to get there and [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=697.92s)]
*  who gets hurt along the way is of no concern to him. And so these members then go along and it [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=703.28s)]
*  makes no sense. And we talked about this for weeks. It was impossible to square the circle. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=707.36s)]
*  What people wanted could not happen. You could not, some people wanted Medicaid cuts. Some people [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=712.4s)]
*  wanted more Medicaid cuts. Some people wanted to reduce deficit. Some people wanted bigger tax cuts [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=717.92s)]
*  and they all just went in line because that's what Donald Trump wanted. Not because he, not because [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=722.4s)]
*  he cut some deal that met in the middle on various things. They just did, ended up going where he [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=726.16s)]
*  wanted to go because they were afraid they lose their primary. Cause the primary comes before [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=732.5600000000001s)]
*  the general. If you lose your primary, you don't even get a chance to suffer the consequences in [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=735.44s)]
*  the general for your vote to kick your constituents off healthcare and food assistance to pay for a [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=738.8000000000001s)]
*  tax cut for rich guys. Yeah. I mean, in a way they got the worst of all worlds. They have a bill that [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=744.96s)]
*  will hugely increase the deficit. We'll also deeply cut Medicaid. We'll also give tax cuts [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=751.12s)]
*  to the richest Americans. We'll also screw over poor Americans and much of Trump's base. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=757.5200000000001s)]
*  And so like, I don't know, I don't know who's leaving this with a, if the, we'll talk about [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=763.52s)]
*  what happens next, but if the house bill became law, I don't know, I don't know who wins from that [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=768.9599999999999s)]
*  except, you know, 1%, top 1%, top 0.1%. That's about it. I mean, data for progress did this polling [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=773.8399999999999s)]
*  experiment where they use some modeling, but basically they modeled support for cuts to [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=781.4399999999999s)]
*  Medicaid throughout every congressional district in the country and nowhere, nowhere was it higher [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=785.4399999999999s)]
*  than 15%. Yeah. I mean, 14 million people and you get 14 million because I think it's around, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=790.88s)]
*  around 9 million for the Medicaid cuts. And then they also declined to extend the enhanced subsidies [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=797.12s)]
*  for the affordable care act. What that means is you get, that's where you get up to 14 million. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=803.76s)]
*  When we were debating repealing the affordable care act, we were talking about how 20 million [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=808.4s)]
*  people could lose their healthcare. Well, now 14 million people could lose their healthcare. A lot [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=812.88s)]
*  of other people, by the way, that's not even counting the people who are just going to pay [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=817.6800000000001s)]
*  more for their healthcare. Medicare beneficiaries who depend on Medicaid are going to pay more for [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=820.96s)]
*  their healthcare. A lot of people are going to lose their Medicaid. Other people are going to [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=825.28s)]
*  pay more for their Medicaid. People who were buying their own health insurance on the affordable care [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=828.4s)]
*  act exchanges are going to pay a lot more. Some of them will lose their healthcare for good. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=833.04s)]
*  Rural hospitals are going to close because of this. It's like, it's probably the biggest assault on [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=836.8000000000001s)]
*  healthcare, on people's healthcare coverage that we've seen in our lifetimes. It's one of the [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=842.0s)]
*  greatest transfers of wealth from the poor to the rich in the history of this country. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=846.4s)]
*  Yeah. I mean- And guess what? We should be going the other way on the transfer of wealth. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=850.0799999999999s)]
*  We should be going, yes. Yes, exactly. Any other stuff in the bill worth knowing about? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=854.4s)]
*  It defunds Planned Parenthood by denying Medicaid funding to any organization who [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=860.0799999999999s)]
*  has abortion services as part of their offering, which is intentionally written to target Planned [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=866.72s)]
*  Parenthood. There is a massive increase in the defense budget. Good job, Fiscal Hawks. A [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=871.52s)]
*  hundred billion dollars, I think it is, for Trump's mass deportation plan. There are, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=877.52s)]
*  at one point, I don't know if this is the end of the final bill, that they were limiting the excise [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=886.48s)]
*  tax on tanning beds. A huge priority of many people. Jesus. The thing is, this bill is so big, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=889.1999999999999s)]
*  and so if people have read the whole thing, that we're going to be discovering what's in this bill [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=896.64s)]
*  for weeks. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that brings us to the Senate, which will be taking up this bill. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=900.4s)]
*  Before we get to the Senate, can we just for one moment, just pause on the fact that they call it [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=906.0799999999999s)]
*  the One Big Beautiful Bill Act? I know. Redundant. I know it's been a while since Schoolhouse Rocks [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=910.0799999999999s)]
*  has been on TV, but it's a bill until it's an act. It would have been so easy to just do one big, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=917.28s)]
*  beautiful act. You know, and I fucking hate all the acronyms on everything related to Congress. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=921.28s)]
*  I didn't know it was called this until I saw someone write, I got one of those emails from [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=927.76s)]
*  some group that was giving us, you know, what's going on with the bill. And it's like, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=932.5600000000001s)]
*  OBAAA, OBAAA. I was like, what the fuck is OBAAA? I read, kept putting that in some of his writing. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=936.64s)]
*  What? I did not know what the OBBB was for a long time. Jesus Christ. Yes. Makes us yearn [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=943.28s)]
*  for the days of the Biff. They have these MAGA accounts that for like every child born, they were [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=949.12s)]
*  going to put a thousand dollars in the stock market. Well, now I think they're not putting [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=954.88s)]
*  the thousand dollars anymore. It's just a tax-free savings account now. Right. Oh, that's cool. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=958.0s)]
*  Basically, they named it the MAGA account and I was like, they must have made MAGA stand for [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=962.4s)]
*  something, right? And they did. I think it just stands for MAGA, right? No, no. This is a small [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=967.52s)]
*  thing, but this is how they fucked this up. MAGA stood for something. It was like, I'm gonna [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=973.36s)]
*  account or something, right? I can't remember what it is now. But then in the middle of the night, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=978.0s)]
*  last night, they suddenly changed one change in the bill was changing all the instances of MAGA [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=982.16s)]
*  account in the legislation to the Trump account. They needed to change the Trump account. Right. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=988.16s)]
*  But the end result here is it sounds on paper like something like baby bonds with a child tax [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=992.48s)]
*  credit, but what it really is likely to end up being is a tax haven for wealthy people. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=997.76s)]
*  Yeah. Just like everything else in there. All right. The Senate. So John Thune said today, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1002.24s)]
*  oh, the Senate's gonna write up, we're gonna write our own bill and we're just gonna use the [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1008.72s)]
*  House bill as guidance. You got Murkowski and Collins who both said that they don't like the [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1011.6s)]
*  Medicaid cuts. Then you have other people like I think Kevin Kramer was saying he wants deeper [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1019.2s)]
*  Medicaid cuts. You got Rand Paul saying, I don't want the debt ceiling lifted in this bill. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1025.52s)]
*  Ron Johnson's a no on the whole thing. Ron Johnson's worried about the debt. He said he [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1030.72s)]
*  wants deeper cuts. So what do you think, what are the opportunities in the Senate here for [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1034.4s)]
*  Democrats to, if not kill the bill, at least improve it? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1040.72s)]
*  It's interesting because there's no negotiating with Democrats here, right? There's no Joe [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1045.8400000000001s)]
*  Manchin or anyone left that you would that that through like, so Thune can lose three votes. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1049.68s)]
*  Yeah. And he's got all sorts of problems all across the board. He hasn't similar, similar to [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1054.0s)]
*  the House in the sense that he has moderates who like Murkowski and Collins who do not want [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1059.44s)]
*  such Medicaid cuts and performative populists like Josh Hawley who also say they don't want [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1064.4s)]
*  Medicaid cuts. And then you got a bunch of people who want more Medicaid cuts. Where's that gonna [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1069.52s)]
*  come down? There's people who are gonna care about how the Medicaid cuts are, like which [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1073.44s)]
*  Medicaid cuts there are, not just the top line. And ultimately you're probably gonna, they're [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1077.92s)]
*  gonna be forced to pass something pretty close to the House I think because otherwise it's not [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1083.92s)]
*  gonna pass. And they have a ticking clock here because the debt limit is in this bill, which [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1088.08s)]
*  I did not mention when you asked me this question. And the debt limit has to be extended. Ex-date, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1092.48s)]
*  the date when we run out of cash is supposed to be in July, I believe is the last time Scott [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1097.36s)]
*  Besson said it. So before these folks leave for August recess, they have to pass something to [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1101.6s)]
*  extend the debt limit or we would default or we would mint a $1 trillion Trump coin or something [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1107.4399999999998s)]
*  to solve the problem. That'll do wonders for the bond markets, I'm sure. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1113.6799999999998s)]
*  Great. The bond markets are very excited about everything that's been happening these days. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1118.32s)]
*  The House is known to the Senate, what the Senate usually does to the House, which is [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1122.24s)]
*  send them a bill that they can't make a ton of changes to. What I would think about from the [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1125.6799999999998s)]
*  perspective of Democrats is put as much pressure as you can on senators, absolutely including the [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1129.76s)]
*  ones like Tom Tillis who were up in 2026 and use this as an opportunity and try to get some of [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1134.72s)]
*  those Medicaid cuts scaled back in some way, shape or form. But even absent that, the reason why this [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1142.48s)]
*  fight is worth having and making a big sinking fight is we know these Medicaid cuts are incredibly [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1147.52s)]
*  unpopular. We also know based on a Navigator research poll that came out this morning that [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1152.0s)]
*  most people do not know about the Medicaid cuts. They ask people what stories you've been hearing [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1156.56s)]
*  a lot of and only 27% of respondents said they've been hearing a lot about the Medicaid cuts. That's [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1160.24s)]
*  half what we've been hearing about the tariffs or the new Pope and stories like that. So we have [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1164.8s)]
*  some time here, but in every day that this bill is not yet law, we should try to put so much political [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1169.28s)]
*  pressure on them that they scale them back. But failing that, at least we'll be informing people [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1175.12s)]
*  that they exist, that they will pay the price next November. On Tuesday, Trump went to the hill [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1179.36s)]
*  and told Republicans in a closed door meeting, quote, don't fuck with Medicaid. But of course, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1185.36s)]
*  they fucked with Medicaid. Boy, did they. And he's thrilled. He's taken a victory lap. He's saying [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1192.3999999999999s)]
*  it's amazing. Clearly, you mentioned this, he just thinks he can get away with lying about it. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1198.2399999999998s)]
*  Which maybe he can with his base, at least, because you know, the way they have set it up, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1205.84s)]
*  now they moved up the work requirements, but the cuts to Medicaid and the people losing their health [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1212.3999999999999s)]
*  insurance probably won't happen until after the midterms. The work requirements are scheduled to [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1217.04s)]
*  go into effect right after the midterms. I guess if the ACA subsidies don't get extended past this [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1223.12s)]
*  year, then that'll start hitting people soon. But there is a question of, we know that when people [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1228.8s)]
*  feel the effects of policy, their political opinions can change. But when they are told [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1235.52s)]
*  the effects of policy, they may either not believe it or just not hear it, or believe the lies they're [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1241.12s)]
*  told from the people that they voted for and support. So how do you think about the most [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1247.76s)]
*  effective way to make a political case other than just screaming about Medicaid cuts? And also, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1253.28s)]
*  sorry, I'm asking a lot of questions. Medicaid versus like 14 million people losing their [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1259.28s)]
*  health care. What do you think about that? Because I never want to leave out the ACA stuff and [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1265.84s)]
*  just talk about Medicaid, because then if someone isn't on Medicaid, they might think, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1270.32s)]
*  oh, I'll be fine when they may not be fine. Right. So I think I do this in the following ways. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1274.32s)]
*  One is, it's absolutely essential to tie the cuts to Medicaid to pay for the tax cuts for the rich. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1281.84s)]
*  And the reason why this is important is, what we have to do is telling a story about who Trump and [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1288.72s)]
*  these House Republicans in particular are fighting for. And it's not for you. It's not for working [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1294.8000000000002s)]
*  class people. It is for the rich. And that was a very effective message in 2018, because Republicans [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1299.04s)]
*  wanted to pay for those tax cuts with cuts to Medicare, Social Security, and repealing the ACA. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1305.68s)]
*  They're going to lie about it. Remember all the ads in 2018 of Republicans staring into the camera [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1309.28s)]
*  saying, I would never vote to kick people with pre-existing conditions off of health care after [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1314.6399999999999s)]
*  they had just voted to kick people with pre-existing conditions off of health care. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1318.24s)]
*  And so they're going to lie about it. That didn't work then. And we can make sure it doesn't work [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1321.44s)]
*  now. Medicaid, the word Medicaid is incredibly powerful in that same Navigator poll. 75% of [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1324.8s)]
*  people, including 62% of Republicans oppose cuts to Medicaid. When you ask people to, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1333.28s)]
*  if they want to cut Medicaid a lot, cut Medicaid a little, keep it the same or increase it. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1338.48s)]
*  Most people want to increase it, increase funding for Medicaid. And so we shouldn't [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1344.24s)]
*  run away from that. But the broader story here is that the House Republicans want to, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1348.24s)]
*  and Trump and House Republicans, want to give huge tax cuts to the ultra wealthy corporation. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1354.48s)]
*  They want to pay for it by kicking people, by cutting Medicaid, kicking people off their [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1359.92s)]
*  health care and taking food off the table from school children. 18 million kids' lunches are [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1363.76s)]
*  at risk in the snap cuts in this bill. 3 million people losing food assistance. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1368.96s)]
*  And so it is that, that's the story we're telling. It's not about the specific policy. It's not the [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1372.6399999999999s)]
*  specific impacts which are going to come down the line. It is a story about who these Republicans [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1376.3999999999999s)]
*  are and who they're fighting for. Yeah. There's one thing that I think is pretty easy to understand [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1380.3999999999999s)]
*  and also just infuriating when it's put like this. If you make over $4 million a year, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1386.08s)]
*  you will get $400,000 in tax cuts. If you are the 40% of Americans making $50,000 and under, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1394.08s)]
*  your income is going to go down. So people making under, people, working people making under $50,000 [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1404.8s)]
*  are going to lose income so that fucking people who make over $4 million can get $400,000 as a [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1410.9599999999998s)]
*  tax cut. That's what our government's spending money on. $400,000 for multimillionaires. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1417.28s)]
*  Like, I don't know. It just, it seems like that is a, it's a pretty easy thing for people to [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1422.6399999999999s)]
*  understand. And if they want to defend that, great. Go defend that. Yeah. We have to make [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1428.96s)]

*  meeting between Trump and South African president Cyril Ramaphosa, which our president used as an [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1577.28s)]
*  opportunity to spread his favorite new conspiracy theory that there's a genocide against white [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1582.64s)]
*  South Africans. Trump held up a bunch of random press clippings. Then he dimmed the lights for [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1588.0s)]
*  the video portion of the presentation, which was a hard to follow montage both for viewers at home [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1594.32s)]
*  and for president Ramaphosa. Here's a sampling of what it all sounded like. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1600.8s)]
*  Terrible. That was the biggest. That was reported all the time. This is sort of the opposite of a [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1618.0s)]
*  part. What's happening now is never reported. Nobody knows about it. These are articles over [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1623.68s)]
*  the last few days. Death of people. Death. Death. Death. Horrible death. Death. I don't know. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1629.52s)]
*  Tommy and I watched the whole thing live unfold while we were in the office. First of all, it [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1648.72s)]
*  went on forever. It was the most surreal experience. A lot of the coverage tried to compare it to the [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1653.68s)]
*  Zelensky meeting, which it really was. It was also a completely batshit crazy meeting, but the [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1659.04s)]
*  Zelensky meeting was really tense and JD Vance is yelling. This one was just like he was holding a [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1665.28s)]
*  salon and all of the delegation that came with the South African president, they got involved. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1672.4s)]
*  They brought some white Afrikaner professional golfers because I guess the poor South African [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1679.2s)]
*  president must have thought to himself, oh, I must have the white golfers to potentially [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1686.4s)]
*  communicate with this white golfer who's quite racist. Maybe I will be able to break through by [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1690.8000000000002s)]
*  bringing my white golfers. Then we're going to talk about it, but he's screaming at the [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1696.56s)]
*  reporters, yelling at Peter Alexander for asking a question about the Qatari plane. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1703.04s)]
*  He's holding up the press clippings. President Ramaphosa is like, that video you just saw, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1706.96s)]
*  I don't know where those crosses are. I don't know who you're talking about. Trump's like, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1712.0s)]
*  well, it's in South Africa. He's like, no, I know. Because he's like, where did that all come from? [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1717.36s)]
*  It came from South Africa. The Zelensky meeting was pretty normal compared to this. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1722.16s)]
*  If you put aside the fact that it was- It was angrier and more tense. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1728.88s)]
*  Well, that one felt like, put aside the fact that the most surreal part of the Zelensky meeting was [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1731.76s)]
*  that you had the United States beating up on the ally we were supporting in the war in service of [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1738.72s)]
*  Vladimir Putin. Put that aside for a second. It felt like a meeting that could happen behind [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1744.48s)]
*  closed doors just with people being dicks. It is high stakes. We were sending a lot of money there. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1748.32s)]
*  This was bananas. You just have the South African president just randomly showing up here for a [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1757.28s)]
*  meeting, any normal pro forma meeting we have with world leaders all the time. The president is- You [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1760.96s)]
*  use the term press clippings. These are mostly Facebook posts that are printed out. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1767.4399999999998s)]
*  Like it is- Natalie, do you have my clips? That's what he was yelling about. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1771.9199999999998s)]
*  Natalie, who just exists with the printer, I guess. I guess she's a human printer with a real printer. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1778.24s)]
*  Then she just- I think that's her job. She's the one that prints out of the [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1782.56s)]
*  close book. That's literally her job. I read the profile of Natalie. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1785.52s)]
*  She just prints out Facebook posts and hand them over. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1788.7199999999998s)]
*  Which makes her one of the top 10 most powerful people in the government right now. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1792.0s)]
*  Fucking market Rubio would love to be able to hand Facebook posts to Donald Trump these days. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1796.32s)]
*  He can only aspire to that job. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1800.96s)]
*  Jenny Vance is kissing up to Natalie to try to get some good- [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1802.16s)]
*  It's going to be Marco's fifth job pretty soon. He's going to be a narcissist with that. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1804.16s)]
*  But yeah, no, the white genocide conspiracy theory, as much as we were just laughing, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1807.28s)]
*  is horrific. Basically what's going on here is Trump and before Trump, Elon Musk, and before [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1812.16s)]
*  Elon Musk, way before Elon Musk, I don't know, just random 4chan and 8chan trolls on the internet [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1823.3600000000001s)]
*  started this, believed that there is a genocide against South African farmers, most of whom are [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1829.28s)]
*  Afrikaners, white Afrikaners. They are worried about- they're basically- the theory is that the [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1836.08s)]
*  overwhelming majority black population of South Africa is going after the land of the white [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1844.16s)]
*  farmers because white farmers have most of the land, even though they represent a tiny [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1850.08s)]
*  percentage of the population, and are murdering white farmers all over the place and committing [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1852.8799999999999s)]
*  genocide against them. Now, white Afrikaners in South Africa in the government do not believe [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1858.16s)]
*  that a white genocide is occurring. In fact, in the Oval Office, we're like, oh no, there are [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1864.8000000000002s)]
*  murders and there is crime in South Africa, but it's nothing like a genocide. There are stats on [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1870.88s)]
*  this. There were nearly 7,000 people were murdered in South Africa between October and December of [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1877.76s)]
*  2024. Of these nearly 7,000 people murdered, 12 were killed in farm attacks and some of those people [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1883.6s)]
*  were black. So that's the white genocide theory, the opposite of apartheid, as Trump so beautifully [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1891.36s)]
*  put it. The reasons why Trump brought this up, I think, are very telling about his worldview, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1902.9599999999998s)]
*  the central premises of MAGAism and the spread of right-wing nationalism around the world. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1911.84s)]
*  This is not about what's happening in South Africa. The world is getting more diverse. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1921.28s)]
*  America is getting more diverse. We are on an inexorable path towards being a majority minority [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1924.56s)]
*  country. What Trump has always tried to weaponize is this fear that the white Christian, mostly men, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1929.52s)]
*  are going to lose their political power that they, in his view, believe is their birthright [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1940.24s)]
*  as the country becomes more diverse. That is Stephen Miller's, we're losing our American [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1945.1200000000001s)]
*  identity. Immigration is diluting who we are and all of that. This idea that somewhere across the [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1948.16s)]
*  world there is an example of a place where whites are the minority and this mythical genocide is [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1953.76s)]
*  happening is a tool to scare people here, to incite people to more racial animus, to be more [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1960.48s)]
*  racially polarized. That is ultimately how authoritarianism works, is you pick an other. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1969.76s)]
*  It could be black people, Latinos, immigrants, Jews, and they are threatening the regime. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1978.48s)]
*  You should be so scared of this happening that you are willing to voluntarily hand over [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1985.28s)]
*  your rights and freedoms in exchange for safety. When Trump talks about how we go back to the 50s [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=1991.92s)]
*  again, it's a very specific reference to a time before the Voting Rights Act, to a time when [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2001.44s)]
*  America was much more white. But you look at what happened in Hungary. Orban has a very similar [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2006.72s)]
*  playbook for how he was able to consolidate power. This is obviously tied to the fact that the world's [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2012.8799999999999s)]
*  richest man hangs out with Donald Trump all the time and he also happens to be a white South [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2017.52s)]
*  African who pushes this specific conspiracy theory. But the reason why Trump vibes with it [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2020.32s)]
*  is because it's consistent with his worldview. Well, and the key here is grievance politics, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2026.8799999999999s)]
*  which is what Trump practices and what most authoritarians practice, is fueled by a belief [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2033.12s)]
*  that they are the ones, the in-group is the ones being discriminated against. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2039.52s)]
*  Right? And so Trump doesn't say, I don't like diversity. I don't like, you know, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2046.24s)]
*  their argument is, of course, we want everyone to be equal, but we are the ones being discriminated [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2052.88s)]
*  against. It's reverse racism. And so they can point to South Africa, where, by the way, there [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2059.6s)]
*  was apartheid until 1996. And the reason there's even conflict about the land there is because [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2064.8s)]
*  this tiny percentage of white South Africans, Afrikaners own a gigantic percentage of the land. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2070.32s)]
*  And so they are trying to basically rectify what happened after decades of apartheid in the country. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2077.04s)]
*  Never mind all that. If they can look at, there's one country in the world where, oh, it's the [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2083.28s)]
*  white minority that is being discriminated against, that is being targeted, then they can say, see, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2089.28s)]
*  this is what could happen in the United States. This is what could happen in Europe, maybe not [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2094.0s)]
*  with black people from South Africa, but maybe it's immigrants from the Middle East. Maybe it's [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2098.88s)]
*  immigrants from elsewhere, right? It's just no matter how much power and wealth you have, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2104.8s)]
*  in order to fuel the grievance politics, you need to be the one who is the persecuted minority [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2110.1600000000003s)]
*  somehow. Or in this case, the persecuted majority. Right. But they don't want, I mean, that's, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2115.2000000000003s)]
*  I follow all these accounts now because of the immigration shit. And they're like, they don't [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2121.44s)]
*  think that we're there, the majority, right? It's like it is, it's 20, first it was 5 million [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2124.56s)]
*  immigrants let in and 10 million, then 20 million. And suddenly it's like, it's a trillion, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2130.56s)]
*  it pretty soon is going to be a trillion immigrants and only 10 Americans. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2134.88s)]
*  On a different date, I'd like to talk to you about the accounts you're following and why you're [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2138.64s)]
*  following them. And maybe we should just have like an intervention of sorts. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2141.2s)]
*  It's, it's, that's our friend, Stephen Miller. It's Mike Davis now, because I was arguing with him. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2143.92s)]
*  There are, it's really, you, I talked about this on, and Emma's nodding. I talked about this on [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2149.12s)]
*  offline this week, so you can listen to that. But really I'm exposed to some real bad stuff these [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2152.72s)]
*  days. Yes. I feel like Max is not doing his job, but you're still doing this. So step up Max. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2157.9199999999996s)]
*  Let me tell you, it's pretty dark. It's pretty dark. All right. So believe it or not, as I [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2162.3999999999996s)]
*  mentioned, the meeting went even further off the rails when NBC's Peter Alexander asked Trump [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2166.16s)]
*  about the $400 million Qatari luxury jet that the Department of Defense has now officially accepted [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2172.08s)]
*  as a gift. The president responded to Peter's question by losing his shit. Let's listen. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2178.88s)]
*  If there weren't fake news like this jerk that we have here, if we had real reporters, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2185.76s)]
*  they'd be covering it. But the fake news of this country doesn't talk about that. They'll have him [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2191.52s)]
*  talking about why did a country give a free thing of this? Why did a country give an airplane to the [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2197.6800000000003s)]
*  United States Air Force? That's what that idiot talks about after viewing a thing where thousands [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2205.12s)]
*  of people are dead. I'm sorry, I don't have a plane to give you. I wish you did. I would take it. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2210.4s)]
*  If your country offered the United States Air Force a plane, I would take it. Okay. Funniest [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2217.52s)]
*  moment of the meeting, maybe funniest moment of the day. And what a funny day it was. I mean, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2222.96s)]
*  great line there. Funniest moment in the meeting that featured a white genocide slideshow. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2230.08s)]
*  Yes. Yeah, basically. But don't worry, the corrupt date doesn't end there, Dan. Oh no. Corrupt date. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2235.2799999999997s)]
*  Ding ding ding. We need a sting. Why do we not have sound for this? Why do we not have a corrupt [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2243.68s)]
*  date sting, Elijah? Anyone. What is happening? This is not Elijah's responsibility. I'm just throwing him under the bus [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2248.16s)]
*  because it's fun today. On Thursday night, Trump hosted the top 220 investors in his Trump meme [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2254.88s)]
*  coin for a black tie optional dinner at his DC golf club. The top 25 buyers also had a private [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2262.08s)]
*  reception with Trump beforehand. NBC reported that the average seat ended up costing around a million [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2272.72s)]
*  dollars, which now they can afford because they just got another tax cut that's worth a million [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2278.64s)]
*  dollars. And that the approximate total those 200 plus investors spent to gain this kind of access [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2283.04s)]
*  to the president adds up to almost $400 million, which is means they can afford another Qatari [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2288.24s)]
*  jet. This time not as a gift. They can buy their own. Trump can buy his own or his sons can. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2294.9599999999996s)]
*  White House press secretary, Caroline Levitt didn't have the easiest time trying to explain [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2301.4399999999996s)]
*  all of this on Thursday. Here she is taking a question from NBC's Garrett Haake. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2305.9199999999996s)]
*  Garrett, go ahead. Caroline, you guys are very proud of your record on transparency. I have two [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2310.3199999999997s)]
*  transparency related questions for you. Sure. On the president's dinner tonight, will the [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2314.16s)]
*  White House commit to making a list of the attendees public so people can see who's paying for that [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2318.64s)]
*  kind of access to the president? Well, as you know, Garrett, this question has been raised with the [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2323.92s)]
*  president. I have also addressed the dinner tonight. The president is attending it in his personal [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2328.48s)]
*  time. It is not a White House dinner. It's not taking place here at the White House. But certainly [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2333.92s)]
*  I can raise that question and try to get you an answer for it. Okay. That's actually gonna, I don't [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2338.48s)]
*  think she's gonna try very hard. You don't think she's gonna get the answer? No, I don't think so. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2342.8s)]
*  You think it fixes everything now that it's not at the White House and it's just at his golf club? [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2345.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's personal capacity. You can do whatever you want. It's personal capacity. Someone should [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2348.2400000000002s)]
*  tell the Supreme Court who said that Trump only has immunity in his presidential capacity? [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2351.76s)]
*  Yeah, right. No, well, this is a, oh yeah, what is he gonna do here? Does he take, is it, when he [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2355.44s)]
*  takes bribes, it's personal capacity. But when he just accepts gifts to the government and I don't [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2359.2000000000003s)]
*  even know what the official capacity for the meme coin is. Like once again, not a constitutional [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2365.76s)]
*  scholar here, but it does seem like he's gonna take the money in his personal capacity. He's [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2370.4s)]
*  gonna dole out the favors in his official capacity. So falls into a gray area that probably a majority [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2374.88s)]
*  of the Supreme Court is comfortable with. We talked recently about some data that suggested [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2380.48s)]
*  the corruption message isn't breaking through to key voters yet. I guess we should keep trying [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2385.44s)]
*  harder. What do you think? Yes. I mean, if the central, one of the central themes of the Trump's [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2390.7200000000003s)]
*  presidency is about how he can get richer. And I just, just not to fact check the president [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2397.36s)]
*  of the United States, but the United States Air Force is temporarily holding the plane for him [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2401.36s)]
*  before he gets it in his personal capacity at the end. So not a gift to the government, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2404.8s)]
*  a gift to Trump that's just being held by the government for a while. Also, did you read the [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2408.6400000000003s)]
*  New York Times story about the plane being officially accepted? Because they estimate it [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2413.2000000000003s)]
*  could cost up to $1 billion to retrofit the plane so that it is ready to be used as Air Force One. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2421.44s)]
*  It's never going to be used as Air Force One. Where's that money? Where's the billion dollars [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2431.28s)]
*  coming from? Because in that the tax bill they just passed, right? I was going to say how much [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2434.48s)]
*  should we just cut from Medicaid? How much should we just cut from the ACA? How much are we jacked [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2438.64s)]
*  up defense spending in that same bill? So a billion dollars. And it's so stupid. The whole [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2443.04s)]
*  thing is so stupid. The government has already spent $3.9 billion for the two jets, the two new [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2447.92s)]
*  Air Force Ones that Boeing has been working on. So we already have a contract that we paid, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2455.6s)]
*  taxpayers paid $3.9 billion for the two jets that we thought we needed. And that was like the normal [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2460.4s)]
*  course of business. Now we get the $400 million temporary gift until Trump leaves office that [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2465.12s)]
*  they're going to spend maybe a billion dollars retrofitting. And the maintenance costs for an [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2472.4s)]
*  Air Force One, which now I guess we'll have three, is $135 million per year per plane. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2479.12s)]
*  Justin Perdue Just the idea that Trump wanted this plane because he thought it was cool, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2487.28s)]
*  and he thought Boeing was taking too long for his other new planes because the super cool plane [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2492.32s)]
*  he already had was not apparently cool enough for him. Just there's no way this other plane [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2496.8s)]
*  that they're going to have to basically tear down to the studs, one to check it for bugs, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2501.68s)]
*  other listening devices, and then do all the things you have to do to the plane will be ready [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2506.96s)]
*  before the Boeing planes is impossible to fathom the fact that I would be shocked if he flies one [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2511.04s)]
*  day as president on this plane. My guess is a bunch of taxpayer money goes into making it even [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2515.3599999999997s)]
*  cooler. And then he will accept it at the back end in his personal capacity. Yeah, that's just his [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2520.8799999999997s)]
*  to-go bag. Justin Perdue [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2527.6s)]
*  Just his gift bag at the end. Yeah, you get to take the plane with you when you leave the White [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2530.0s)]
*  House. Never flown in. So yeah, so he's just, I don't know, I really do think that the stories, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2534.56s)]
*  we talked about this before, but we just talked about the tax cuts for the rich people, stealing [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2543.3599999999997s)]
*  food off kids' plates, and healthcare from millions of Americans. Meanwhile, he's making money at these [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2549.8399999999997s)]
*  dinners. He's taking $400 million jets. We got to combine the stories. The stories are the same [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2556.88s)]
*  story. Yeah, it's all about him and not about you. And it's going to hurt your life. That's the part [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2563.04s)]
*  that is really important here. The other thing, and this is why Democrats, we talked about this [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2569.44s)]
*  a little bit last week, should be pushing this message is the problem is not just the message, [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2572.88s)]
*  it's the messenger. Is that we as a party, we actually frankly don't have the credit, [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2579.12s)]
*  we'll get to this in a minute, don't have the credibility to deliver any messages right now [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2582.8s)]
*  with great efficacy. But what especially the one we don't is corruption because we're not, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2585.12s)]
*  we are seen as defenders of that same broken system. And as opposed to people would actually [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2590.56s)]
*  take it on and fix it. There are people within our party who have the credibility to do that. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2594.72s)]
*  Bernie Sanders, AOC, Elizabeth Warren, I think in some cases, some people who are outside of [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2597.92s)]
*  government, outside of the federal government probably can, like Ruben Gage or Ruben Gage may [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2603.44s)]
*  have because he's some of the younger folks like Wes Moore, some of the governors might be able to [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2608.3199999999997s)]
*  do it. But as a party, we have to not just make, we have to show people through our actions and our [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2612.96s)]
*  policies that we would actually take on corruption when we're in charge. And if you want to make the [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2620.8s)]
*  message work, you got to fix your messenger problem. All right. Speaking of that, one last [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2627.12s)]
*  thing before we get to your interview with Representative Monica McIver, we have been [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2631.6s)]
*  saying since November that we can't draw too many decisive conclusions about what happened in the [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2636.08s)]
*  election based only on the exit polls. We have to wait for the gold standard data, which comes from [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2641.6s)]
*  two places, Catalyst and Pew. We finally got the Catalyst data and the headlines out of it were as [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2648.64s)]
*  unsurprising as they were depressing. Kamala Harris lost critical ground with young voters and people [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2655.04s)]
*  of color, especially men of color, especially young men of color. In fact, she gained ground only with [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2660.48s)]
*  married white women and not by much. One point. One point. Yeah, it's one point. And it's not clear [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2667.36s)]
*  what they rounded up from to get there. And super voters in this report, which are people who voted [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2674.0s)]
*  in the last four elections. She did one point better with Biden among the super voters, but [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2679.6s)]
*  she lost a lot of ground among the irregular voters, people who have voted in just a few of [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2686.0s)]
*  the last four elections. As Amy Walter and Carrie Dan at the Cook political report put in their [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2690.48s)]
*  headline, the main conclusion from this report is quote, the Obama coalition turned into the Trump [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2696.48s)]
*  coalition. Ouch. First off, can you explain for folks how Catalyst does what it does and why this [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2702.0s)]
*  is such good data? Sure. This is a very complicated process and I am at great risk of oversimplifying [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2709.68s)]
*  it, but Catalyst is a data firm. They ingest all the voter file data around the country. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2715.28s)]
*  Just so people understand, voter data is public in the United States. States keep records of [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2721.36s)]
*  who's registered to vote and if those people voted, which elections they voted, not who they voted [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2728.0s)]
*  for, but if they voted in the election, which primary elections, which general elections, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2732.8s)]
*  which special elections. Some states, I think it's about seven, have demographic information, [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2735.68s)]
*  race and gender information that you get on the voter file. Most states, but not all states, have [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2742.88s)]
*  partisanship. You know if someone's a Democrat or Republican or either registered independent or in [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2748.96s)]
*  some cases, just no party status. We have gotten all the precinct level data from the election, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2754.2400000000002s)]
*  so we know who voted in 2024 all across the country now. That's all commit. Catalyst then [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2762.96s)]
*  takes that data. They combine it with their vote file, which includes census data, commercial data, [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2767.92s)]
*  where they will ingest other information so you can get more information about people in parts of [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2775.28s)]
*  the country. Then they will use some modeling to help figure out, it can be based on people's names, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2780.96s)]
*  where they live, to help people understand demographic information, age, gender, and identify [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2787.2000000000003s)]
*  really all the voters in this country. They do this and then they spend months going through it [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2792.1600000000003s)]
*  to compare it to not just the last election, but every election since 2012, which is as long as [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2798.6400000000003s)]
*  they've been doing this report, to make an assessment of where Democrats gained and lost, [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2803.92s)]
*  in this case mostly lost ground, to fully understand who actually voted. In previous elections, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2809.52s)]
*  the Catalyst report has really upended some immediate post-election takes. There actually [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2815.44s)]
*  is a pretty dramatic shift into 2016 about how women voted based on the exit polls and the Catalyst [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2822.32s)]
*  data. This data gives us much more, this report, which I believe everyone who works in politics at [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2827.36s)]
*  any level should read because it really tells a story of not just how Kamala Harris lost, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2833.36s)]
*  but what has happened to the Democratic coalition over the last eight years. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2838.56s)]
*  But it actually is fairly consistent with a lot of the takes that people had after the election [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2842.4s)]
*  about where Trump gained ground in the Democratic coalition. The numbers are a little different, [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2847.6800000000003s)]
*  this is a little more precise, but the idea that Trump gained with huge core parts of the [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2852.96s)]
*  Democratic coalition, including Latino voters and young voters, is borne out by this report. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2857.92s)]
*  I think the other big, to me the biggest difference in this report when the exit polls is the gender [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2863.6800000000003s)]
*  divide. People had thought in the election there was going to be this huge gender divide, [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2871.1200000000003s)]
*  then the exit polls showed it wasn't as big of a divide as maybe polls had suggested. Turns out [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2876.08s)]
*  it was. But almost entirely because Trump gained with men. Yes, that's what I'm saying, right. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2882.8s)]
*  So Trump gained two points with women, but he gained 11 points with men, which is quite a gain. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2888.08s)]
*  Those gains with women were entirely with Latino women because Kamala Harris, [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2894.72s)]
*  she lost ground almost everywhere, but she held ground with all forms of white women and black [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2899.8399999999997s)]
*  women. Yeah. So you wrote a great message box about this, and you noted how since election day [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2904.88s)]
*  there's been this fierce argument about whether Harris lost because Biden voters didn't turn out, [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2911.04s)]
*  which some people argue means she wasn't progressive enough, or because too many Biden [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2917.12s)]
*  voters switched to Trump, which others argue means that she was too progressive. Of course, [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2922.08s)]
*  you and I have talked about how Biden voters who stayed home aren't necessarily further to the left [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2928.08s)]
*  than Biden voters who switched to Trump. So we're simplifying the argument, but that is the argument [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2934.4s)]
*  that's out there. What was your take on the turnout versus persuasion effect from the [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2938.8s)]
*  catalyst report? This will be deeply dissatisfying to Benny because it includes nuance, but she lost [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2945.7599999999998s)]
*  because of both. Yeah. It is clear in this data that a significant number of people who voted for [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2951.3599999999997s)]
*  Joe Biden in 2020 voted for Donald Trump in 2024. It's also true that 30 million voters dropped out [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2957.7599999999998s)]
*  of the electorate from 2020 to 2024. Now, some of that is people staying home, some of it's people [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2965.04s)]
*  not voting intentionally, some of it's people whose registration gets messed up because they [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2971.36s)]
*  moved or got purged off the rolls. Some of it's because people die in a four-year period. Yeah, [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2975.44s)]
*  we should say that every election there's a huge number of people who fall out of the electorate. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2979.92s)]
*  This is a larger than normal drop-off. It's not like twice as many, but I think it was like 26 [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2985.44s)]
*  million in the previous election drop-off, but this is a large number. Catalyst estimates that [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2993.1200000000003s)]
*  that group is 55% Democrat. What this report cannot tell you is that they were 55% progressive. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=2997.68s)]
*  That's the thing. The raw numbers make it clear that to win, she had to do better with the people [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3009.2s)]
*  who didn't vote and stayed home and the people who did vote and switched their votes. This report [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3015.44s)]
*  doesn't look at why people vote. It's not a poll. They're not asking you all these questions. They're [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3020.08s)]
*  just analyzing existing data. You can't tell you the answer. But either way, the way the math works [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3023.28s)]
*  is she has to do better with both in Denver. We are being squeezed as a party. We are losing people [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3031.52s)]
*  in the middle and we are not getting... I guess the way I'd say this is I reject the entire premise, [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3036.0800000000004s)]
*  and I think you do as well, that ideology is the way to look at this, that you can assume [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3045.0400000000004s)]
*  that being more moderate is going to help you with swing voters in a way that being more progressive [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3050.24s)]
*  is going to help you with these drop-off voters or these new voters. There's not real evidence [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3056.16s)]
*  to prove that. I reject the argument on its face, but either way, both sides are wrong and both [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3062.3199999999997s)]
*  sides are right. We need to do both. I also think that the drop-off in the non-Battleground [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3069.12s)]
*  states was much larger. There was a narrative out there after the election that there was like, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3073.84s)]
*  I forget how many million it was, this many million Biden voters stayed home. 19 million Biden [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3082.48s)]
*  voters stayed home and she ended the race with Liz Cheney. People weren't inspired and they stayed [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3086.8s)]
*  home and there's all these reasons that she moved too much to the center. That's not true. That [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3094.96s)]
*  narrative is just not true. This report bears it out. Every single piece of data bears that out. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3103.52s)]
*  That is not to say that there aren't some people who stayed home, but one way to think about it is [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3107.7599999999998s)]
*  a Biden voter, let's say there's a young black man or young Latino man. That's where basically [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3114.24s)]
*  she lost the most ground. There's a young Latino man who decides to stay home and he stays home [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3122.56s)]
*  because he's pissed about inflation. He thinks that Joe Biden fucked up. He thinks Joe Biden's [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3130.2400000000002s)]
*  too old. He thinks that it was too much inflation, prices were too high, but he doesn't like Donald [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3136.32s)]
*  Trump, so he's going to stay home. Then there's another young Latino man who says, I don't like [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3140.16s)]
*  Joe Biden because of inflation and I think he's too old and I don't really like Donald Trump, but [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3146.0s)]
*  maybe he'll bring prices down a little bit. So I'll vote for Donald Trump. Not much difference [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3152.16s)]
*  ideologically between those two voters, but one gets counted as a I'm staying home and one gets [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3157.28s)]
*  counted as a switcher. So I think that's one way to think about all this. Anything else jump out [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3162.6400000000003s)]
*  at you from the report? There are two things. One, the main story of this is that Democrats are in [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3167.76s)]
*  a huge bit of trouble. There's no way to look at this without recognizing the massive scale of [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3176.0800000000004s)]
*  our problems. You can kind of tell yourself that things might be kind of okay by looking at just [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3181.84s)]
*  the shift from 20 to 24, but if you really want to assess where we are as a party, you have to look [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3187.28s)]
*  at the shift from 2016 to 2024. This is particularly true with Latino voters. In 2012, even with Latino [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3192.6400000000003s)]
*  voters actually is the one group where Hillary Clinton did better than Obama. She's two points [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3203.76s)]
*  better. But so in 2016, Hillary Clinton won 70% of Latino vote. Kamala Harris won 54%. It's a 16 [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3209.2s)]
*  point drop. And then you would like to think that gender, this is all about men. It's not all about [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3218.72s)]
*  men. Latinas moved 17 points in eight years. Latino men went 14 points in eight years. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3223.9199999999996s)]
*  There is no path to that. Latinos are the fastest growing population in the country. They are [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3233.04s)]
*  particularly politically powerful because of how the population is distributed in [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3239.52s)]
*  electoral rich sunbelt states like Texas, Florida, Arizona, Nevada, etc. And so they're becoming more [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3246.8s)]
*  of the electorate and we are losing more of them at a very fast rate. If that trend continues, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3258.08s)]
*  there is no path to Democrats winning elections. And so we have to take that. Everyone was telling [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3262.0s)]
*  themselves stories that maybe 2020 was an aberration because Trump made gains there because of COVID. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3267.76s)]
*  There's a big talk about COVID. This is something bigger than that and we have to address that. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3275.6s)]
*  The second thing in here is that Democrats lost new voters for the first time. Obama got 58% [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3279.28s)]
*  of new voters in 2012. Biden and Clinton got 55%. Kamala Harris only got 49.5% of new voters, [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3285.84s)]
*  which speaks to the gains that Trump made with younger people and particularly young people of [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3293.52s)]
*  color who are coming into the electorate. And if that trend continues, we're in huge trouble. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3299.6800000000003s)]
*  And so the message I take from this is anyone who thinks that we can get away with just tinkering [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3304.6400000000003s)]
*  around the edges, just hoping that Donald Trump becomes unpopular, they nominate some [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3309.68s)]
*  Yahoo in 2028, or we're going to ride the wave of tariffs and inflation to a narrow house victory, [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3315.2799999999997s)]
*  is just re-erasing the dicks on the Titanic. We have to be willing to ask very hard questions. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3322.56s)]
*  We have to be willing to evaluate every premise, look at how we govern campaign [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3330.72s)]
*  message across the board because right now, and this is where the Obama coalition, the Trump [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3335.92s)]
*  coalition point matters, is we are on the wrong side of political history right now. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3340.56s)]
*  We are the party that is hoping for lower turnout, that the fewer people that vote, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3347.12s)]
*  we have a better chance of winning, that we are losing ground with the fastest growing parts of [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3350.96s)]
*  the population, younger voters and Latinos. And that is a party that can win an election every [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3355.2000000000003s)]
*  once in a while if the stars align correctly. But that is a party that will look a lot like [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3361.44s)]
*  the Democratic Party from the 60s until the 90s. And maybe can win when Nixon gets impeached and [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3365.84s)]
*  Nixon resigns and we win that election and then we lose the next 12 years. There has to be a [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3375.12s)]
*  fundamental change in approach, change in the, just in all that we have to really look at it [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3380.16s)]
*  because there is no easy answer here to what is happening. And adding to the challenge is [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3387.2799999999997s)]
*  those same voters are the voters most likely to not even hear what we are saying because [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3391.8399999999997s)]
*  we are doing poorly with irregular voters, meaning the voters who do not always show up. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3400.7999999999997s)]
*  Irregular voters also tend to be the voters who do not pay close attention to politics or consume [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3405.12s)]
*  a lot of political news. And so what happened with Trump is, and we have talked about this [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3411.44s)]
*  before, but people who follow politics closely, follow the news closely, who vote in all the [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3417.12s)]
*  recent elections, Kamala Harris wins those voters by quite a big margin. All the people we are [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3423.28s)]
*  talking to, we are all talking to each other. And Democrats have those people, have the supervoters. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3428.08s)]
*  But Trump won with people who do not follow politics that closely or people who get most [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3434.88s)]
*  of their political news and information from social media. And they are not necessarily getting [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3440.4s)]
*  their information from social media, from political media on social media. It is information and media [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3446.2400000000002s)]
*  on social media that may touch on politics once in a while, but it may not. It may be cultural [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3452.88s)]
*  content, sports content, entertainment, whatever. And they are just getting sort of [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3458.64s)]
*  vibes from the information that they are consuming. And yet, they are still showing up [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3464.0s)]
*  in presidential elections. So it is not like they are apathetic, disconnected, and then they do not [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3470.1600000000003s)]
*  vote. They are voting without fully hearing the Democratic message. Yes, that is true. I mean, [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3475.28s)]
*  we can honestly talk about this for literally hours and perhaps probably should. Yeah, we could [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3481.44s)]
*  talk about it for hours and we will continue to talk about it. But we know that the answer is just [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3486.08s)]
*  finding a Joe Rogan of the left. Yes, that is exactly right. We are one, I have always said [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3491.44s)]
*  we are one podcast away from a sustainable governing majority. Isn't it funny? I was like, [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3496.96s)]
*  I thought that the Joe Rogan of the left cliché, like we left it behind a couple of months ago. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3501.92s)]
*  And then just this week, I am like on Twitter, I am looking around, I am like, why is it back? [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3507.76s)]
*  What happened? Why are we talking about Joe Rogan of the fucking left again? [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3511.92s)]
*  It was that New York Times story. Yeah, I am glad we are not talking about that. Go read it if you [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3515.2000000000003s)]
*  want. You are not going to hear about it from us. But you mentioned talking about this for hours. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3519.2s)]
*  One way people can listen to you talk about this more is by listening to this week's Polar Coaster. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3524.24s)]
*  I am so glad you did this. You did it so smoothly because in our outline, it actually says, [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3529.2799999999997s)]

*  candidates that can win Senate seats in the red states that Democrats used to have back in the [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3563.92s)]

*  Save America. Thank you so much, Dan, for having me. It's such a pleasure to be on with you today. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3830.48s)]
*  Well, thank you so much for joining us. And why don't you just start by telling me what happened [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3836.32s)]
*  on that day at the ICE facility in your district? So we were basically there for an oversight visit. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3840.5600000000004s)]
*  Myself, along with Bonnie Watson Coleman and Rodman and Des both representatives in New Jersey, [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3847.2s)]
*  we were going on an oversight visit. We've done this before. We actually visited a location not [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3853.92s)]
*  too far from there, which wears another ICE facility in our community. Used to doing this. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3858.48s)]
*  People know it as congressional members, we have the right to go to an ICE facility without an [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3864.96s)]
*  appointment and ask for a tour of this facility. This facility has been open since May 1st. They've [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3870.72s)]
*  been receiving detainees, but there was a lot of back and forth with the city, the city administration, [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3877.2s)]
*  because they didn't necessarily have the proper permits. They didn't have the CEO. It's not a [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3882.3999999999996s)]
*  federal jail or prison. It's not a state jail or prison. So they have to abide by local requirements. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3886.9599999999996s)]
*  And so we went there, showed up for our oversight visit. We're waiting. We were immediately [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3894.8799999999997s)]
*  greeted with disrespect, confrontation. They were giving us the run around telling us, [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3900.7999999999997s)]
*  hey, we got to call this person, that person. You got to wait. I mean, it was back and forth to [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3904.9599999999996s)]
*  over an hour plus of waiting. And then obviously the video shows this whole commotion of a situation [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3910.3199999999997s)]
*  happening. And that is when ICE officials arrived, multiple, over a dozen masked individuals, [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3917.12s)]
*  uniformed, camouflage, as well as administrators and Homeland Security arrived and [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3925.44s)]
*  immediately forgot about us, who were waiting there for a tour and went to go confront the mayor. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3931.6800000000003s)]
*  It was crazy. It was an intense situation. We were trying to get answers. We were trying to speak [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3938.0s)]
*  with them. And they basically disregarded us. They had no regard for us. They did not want to talk [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3943.36s)]
*  with us, explain anything. I mean, let alone address the fact that we are here for an oversight [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3948.8s)]
*  visit. This is what we're here for. Whatever you got going on, we don't know anything about that. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3954.72s)]
*  We're just trying to go and have our oversight visit. And so it was just super unfortunate. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3959.4399999999996s)]
*  And the chaos that is seen in all of the videos, ICE created that. They created the chaos. They [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3964.48s)]
*  created the confrontation. And it didn't have to be like that. Once again, we've done this before [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3970.64s)]
*  and we were simply there to do our jobs. So you're a member of Congress at a facility to do your [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3975.6s)]
*  oversight responsibilities. Coming out of that are criminal charges against you. What is your [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3981.2s)]
*  reaction to those charges and what are the next steps? I mean, honestly, it is a very scary moment. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3986.16s)]
*  I think it's really unfortunate. I'm a mom. I have a family. And to have these charges put against me [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=3992.8799999999997s)]
*  to see the possibility of being in prison for such a long time for these charges, it's really [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4000.96s)]
*  unfortunate. But at the same time, it's truly sad for America for something like this to be happening [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4007.84s)]
*  to a person that is not appointed by Donald Trump. I'm not appointed by Elena Haba. I am an elected [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4013.84s)]
*  official where thousands of people in New Jersey expect for me to do my job. And so to know that I [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4019.92s)]
*  showed up there to do my job and then I come out of this situation having felony charges charged [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4025.28s)]
*  against me is crazy. I went to court obviously yesterday via Zoom because I'm here in [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4031.44s)]
*  Washington, D.C. working. And that was a formality. And now I'm looking forward to my day in court, [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4037.44s)]
*  looking for the next process and the next step of this all. But honestly, it's truly a scary time [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4043.28s)]
*  when doing your job, showing up to your job as a member of Congress can land you with felony [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4049.6s)]
*  assault charges. You're a new member of Congress. Have your colleagues that you're with, the [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4055.6s)]
*  colleagues you've spoken with, have they ever had an experience like the one you guys had where you [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4060.08s)]
*  were denied access to a facility before? Not that I know of. I mean, I haven't heard anyone say it. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4065.28s)]
*  Like I said, me, Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman and Representative Rodman, and as we've [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4071.44s)]
*  been to a location before where we got a tour of a facility, it's ran by a different group, [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4076.88s)]
*  a different private group. But we might have had some delay, but we were able to get a tour. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4083.76s)]
*  We've never experienced that before, like the situation that we experienced at Delaney Hall. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4088.7200000000003s)]
*  But at the same time, it's just unbelievable that something like that can happen. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4094.56s)]
*  What are we doing? Why is this happening? Why can't we just show up and do our job [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4103.2s)]
*  as congressional members? It's just super unfortunate. If you can, can you talk a little [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4108.24s)]
*  bit about the specific interaction with the agent that this government has alleged that you pushed? [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4113.12s)]
*  I've seen the video, but if you could just talk a little bit about what happened in that moment, [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4122.32s)]
*  I think it'd be helpful for our listeners. Well, it was a very tense situation. Once again, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4126.08s)]
*  this was a situation when you had three members of Congress. You had the mayor of the largest city [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4131.2s)]
*  in New Jersey, and you had protesters, which were peaceful protesters. This was something. They [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4137.2s)]
*  had been protesting for days and days at this location peacefully. To have that interaction [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4142.16s)]
*  happen, literally there was a lot of shoving and pushing that was going on, but I have no idea [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4148.88s)]
*  what agent they're talking about or what they're claiming. We don't know from the [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4155.28s)]
*  complaint that they submitted. We don't have an agent's name. People do not identify themselves [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4160.16s)]
*  to us where I can say, oh, this was agent such and such. I have no idea about the complaint. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4164.8s)]
*  Can you talk a little bit about how you view these charges against you in the larger Trump [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4170.72s)]
*  administration effort to silence critics? Do you see this as part of a larger assault on democracy? [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4176.32s)]
*  This is a pretty unprecedented situation where you have the federal government, the executive branch [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4183.84s)]
*  from the other party pressing criminal charges against a member of Congress for something [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4191.28s)]
*  involving their use of their actual exercise of their duties and free speech and prior to assembly [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4197.28s)]
*  and all of those things. Can you talk a little bit about that? Well, it's a political intimidation. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4204.24s)]
*  We've seen it over and over and over again with this administration since January 20th. We've seen [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4209.5199999999995s)]
*  it with judges. We've seen it with other leaders. We see him opening up investigations on people [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4215.28s)]
*  just because these are political figures that he doesn't agree with what they say or they criticize [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4220.88s)]
*  the administration. He has literally weaponized every department, especially the DOJ, against [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4226.24s)]
*  people that he disagrees with. I'm the latest victim of that and I am watching this play out. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4233.76s)]
*  If it can happen to me as a member who's just doing her job, it can happen to any member, [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4240.72s)]
*  but specifically just regular individuals who've been expressing their concerns with us about how [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4245.84s)]
*  they're being treated by ICE and Homeland Security. We can understand their concerns and their [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4251.599999999999s)]
*  complaints based off what I personally experienced and the other members of Congress that were with [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4257.12s)]
*  me experienced. It's definitely political intimidation. They want to make me, shut me up, [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4261.92s)]
*  stop me from doing my job, put fear in me, scare me, but at the end of the day, I will not wait for [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4268.4s)]
*  a Dan. I am in this job. I signed up for this. I ran for office. The people of New Jersey elected [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4273.52s)]
*  me and so I must serve. I must do my job and they're not going to shut me up. Donald Trump is not [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4279.68s)]
*  going to prosecute me because I'm woke, whatever that means. They're just not going to do that [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4285.4400000000005s)]
*  to me. What is the reaction of your colleagues? You've obviously been in Congress all night [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4291.76s)]
*  for the last, you probably haven't been to bed in a very long time. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4297.4400000000005s)]
*  I had a sleep and a nap today, Dan. At least you woke up for the vote on like that Republican who [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4301.84s)]
*  missed his vote. What have you heard from, you've been with all of your colleagues, have you heard [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4306.96s)]
*  anything? What's the reaction from Democratic colleagues? Have you heard anything from [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4312.24s)]
*  Republican colleagues perhaps? Well, my Democratic colleagues have been extremely [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4315.68s)]
*  helpful. I mean, the support of just them having my back, it's really been appreciative. I think [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4321.2s)]
*  that the caucus understands, the Democratic caucus understands that if they can use this new tool [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4328.72s)]
*  to charge Congress members for doing their job or for being a critic or speaking out against [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4335.28s)]
*  the administration, they know we are in deeper trouble. We know that our democracy is at stake [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4340.8s)]
*  here. We've seen Trump strip away pieces and pieces of our democracy each and every day. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4346.48s)]
*  And this is a bigger situation than just me. It's a bigger situation than just the judge in [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4351.919999999999s)]
*  Wisconsin. This is a situation where we have a president who has taken away the basic things [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4357.44s)]
*  that we love about America, the right to due process, the right to freedoms, the right to [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4362.959999999999s)]
*  believe what we want to believe in and do how we want to do in this world that we call America. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4369.28s)]
*  This is why we're here. And to have this president stripping away our democracy every chance he gets [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4375.6s)]
*  every hour on the hour, sometimes it's dangerous. We're heading down the wrong path and we have to [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4381.280000000001s)]
*  push back against this. I think people need to stay woke and they need to stay awake and they need [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4389.200000000001s)]
*  to stay engaged and informed regarding this situation. I think from the Republican caucus, [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4394.96s)]
*  obviously we're seeing exactly what we expect. They rather serve Trump than serve their [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4400.4s)]
*  constituents. And so what are they doing to me? They are putting in resolutions to get me kicked [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4406.32s)]
*  off committees. They're asking for me to be censured. Yesterday, Nancy Mays, who's more [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4412.5599999999995s)]
*  concerned about me than serving her constituents, asked for me to put in a resolution for me to be [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4417.36s)]
*  expelled from Congress. These are the same people who said that January 6 rioters were good people. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4422.96s)]
*  They supported Trump pardoning these individuals who beat police officers, who were hurt very badly, [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4430.4s)]
*  who stormed the Capitol. But today they want to see me kicked out of Congress for doing my job. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4437.839999999999s)]
*  So this is what I'm seeing across the board. And like I said, Dan, I am committed to this work. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4444.48s)]
*  I'm committed to my job. And none of this will bully me or waver or make me stop doing my job. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4450.16s)]
*  Last question for you. As we mentioned earlier, the House just passed the one big, beautiful bill, [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4457.84s)]
*  as Trump calls it, otherwise known as a bill to cut taxes of the rich and pay forward by taking [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4466.5599999999995s)]
*  food and health care away from working class and poor Americans. What's your reaction to that [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4471.2s)]
*  passage of the bill? Where does it go from here? Sad time. I honestly can't believe that Republicans [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4476.08s)]
*  are just more concerned and scared of Donald Trump than scared of the voters in their districts. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4482.64s)]
*  To say that you're taking food off the table, cutting SNAP benefits, cutting Medicaid. I mean, [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4488.96s)]
*  people are going to die, Dan. Like hospitals are going to close. Funding is being stripped away [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4494.4800000000005s)]
*  from communities and specifically many of these communities that Republicans represent. And the [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4500.08s)]
*  fact that they're more scared of Donald Trump and they're serving him than serving the people that [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4506.160000000001s)]

*  everything that we're seeing play out right now, today, tomorrow, yesterday, I hope that it really [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4517.68s)]
*  reflects for 2026 midterms. And I hope that voters remember what their members did to them [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4523.6s)]
*  and what they voted on, what they supported. Them serving Donald Trump and serving the people. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4529.280000000001s)]
*  I really hope that they have a good memory on this era that we're in. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThregX7d4G4&t=4534.160000000001s)]
