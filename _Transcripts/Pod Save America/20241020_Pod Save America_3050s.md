Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

*  the state of the house and Senate races and Democrats chances of winning [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=35.96s)]
*  a trifecta in this election. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=38.72s)]
*  Amy Walter, welcome to Pod Save America. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=40.42s)]
*  How are you? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=42.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=42.92s)]
*  I'm pretty good, you know, for what are we 20 days out? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=43.64s)]
*  I'm, I'm still here. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  So really that's the goal. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=50.84s)]
*  That is the goal that I am upright and, you know, just trying to, to pace myself. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=52.24s)]
*  While we have you all know, I want to talk about the presidential race, but [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=59.64s)]
*  also the Senate and the house, something, both of all three of which are an [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=61.64s)]
*  expert in, let's start with the presidential. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=64.76s)]
*  Three weeks ago or so Democrats were feeling ecstatic. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=67.28s)]
*  They were feeling confident over the last week or so the Democrats have gotten [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=70.84s)]
*  anxious with this is the phase we get in every year. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=76.36s)]
*  Have you seen anything in what you've seen in the race and the polling and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=79.36s)]
*  people you're talking to that would justify the vibe shift among Democrats? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=83.36s)]
*  Yeah, then it's a really good question. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=89.0s)]
*  And I, I dug into this myself because I, I, I always wonder, all right, how much [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=91.24s)]
*  of this is real and how much of this is just sort of a mood that's not backed [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=97.91999999999999s)]
*  up by actual data. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=102.36s)]
*  And so if you look at the national average, like things haven't moved that [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=104.24s)]
*  much, they're moving around the edges. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=108.11999999999999s)]
*  At the state level, I think the reason for the frustration, depression, whatever [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=111.16s)]
*  you want to call it, anxiety among Democrats is that you can see, and if you [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=117.0s)]
*  go to the five 38 site, which does a great job with this, right, because they [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=122.6s)]
*  have the trend line and you, uh, as well as many of the folks in your business, in [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=125.88s)]
*  our business, appreciate a good trend line, right? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=133.64s)]
*  And what you can see though, it is a very small trend line, but that the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=137.32s)]
*  peak for Harris was basically, not surprisingly close to the end of September, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=141.84s)]
*  right? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  That was after she had the strong debate performance. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=147.32000000000002s)]
*  You had the DNC that went really well. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=152.08s)]
*  The wall rollout went well, right? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=155.08s)]
*  Like that was, I would say peak for Harris. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=157.12s)]
*  And since then it's kind of gone down. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=160.60000000000002s)]
*  And so instead of being ahead in a state like Michigan, by an average of two points, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=163.60000000000002s)]
*  she's now ahead by nine tenths of a point, right? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=169.52s)]
*  Or one point. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  So we're really talking about movement of a point or a half a point in most of [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=173.60000000000002s)]
*  those battleground states. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=178.12s)]
*  But as you know, half a point or a point is the difference between winning and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=179.68s)]
*  losing in these states. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=185.04000000000002s)]
*  So it seems there, there is some reason to, again, if you're just looking at the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=185.96s)]
*  poll averages to say, well, boy, was that a peak? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=192.20000000000002s)]
*  Did you peak too early? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  That's the thing Democrats also love to talk about. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=197.36s)]
*  Oh, we think we think too early. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=199.32s)]
*  We need to pick up the election. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=201.35999999999999s)]
*  But it's also a sign that, you know, coalescing the base has gotten her to a [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=203.84s)]
*  certain place, but it's not getting her as far as she needs to to win this thing [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=210.6s)]
*  outright. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=217.44s)]
*  The other thing I noticed, and we noticed this in our own data, as well as just [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=218.35999999999999s)]
*  looking at all of those national, the network polls that came out last weekend, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=223.32s)]
*  that her slipping is with independent voters. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=229.92s)]
*  And so, you know, that's something to keep aware of. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=234.72s)]
*  But again, we're talking about a movement of half a point to a point. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=238.44s)]
*  So freak out about that as you will. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=248.44s)]
*  Choose your level of panic based on that information. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=249.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=251.84s)]
*  It's so hard because we've never seen a race this close in all the states. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=252.12s)]
*  Usually the margins are a little bit larger and usually they're larger in some states [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=257.92s)]
*  and maybe narrow in just the tipping point state, for instance. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=261.24s)]
*  But here it's all seven and nationally are within the margin of error. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=264.04s)]
*  So it's so hard to separate real movement. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=267.88s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=271.68s)]
*  From statistical noise. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=272.24s)]
*  From noise. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=273.2s)]
*  And then, right. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=273.92s)]
*  And from what is, to me, it kind of comes back to, all right, well, how likely do you [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=274.96s)]
*  think these people who are answering the polls or who we're waiting the polls to [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=281.36s)]
*  are going to show up, right? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=286.52000000000004s)]
*  And that's where we really get into the difficult prediction part because, you [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=288.12s)]
*  know, we all talk about it comes down, it all comes down to turnout, but nobody [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=296.52000000000004s)]
*  really knows what that's going to look like. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=302.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=304.8s)]
*  And you, you know, it's part of your Quick Political Report, Swing State [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=305.0s)]
*  Polling Project. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=308.40000000000003s)]
*  You had an analysis that showed that Kamala Harris is doing much better with [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=309.08000000000004s)]
*  highly engaged voters and that Trump is depending on low to mid-propensity. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=314.16s)]
*  Can you talk a little bit about what you guys found? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=320.32s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=321.68s)]
*  Thanks for bringing that up. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=322.32000000000005s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=323.96000000000004s)]
*  We did this project. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=324.16s)]
*  We've had three different polls. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  We're doing them with BSG, the Bennet & Sons Strategy Group, a democratic polling [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=328.72s)]
*  firm, and GS Strategy Group, which is a Republican firm. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=332.52000000000004s)]
*  And these guys have been fantastic partners in part because they both work [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=336.2s)]
*  in states that are purple or sometimes in states that aren't friendly to their [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=341.0s)]
*  side, so they appreciate a real swing state. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=345.88s)]
*  But what we did is we broke up the overall electorate in those seven states [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=348.84s)]
*  into basically three buckets. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=354.36s)]
*  One being people who show up in every, who've shown up in the last four elections. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=356.52s)]
*  And what we know about people who show up in election after election is they're [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=361.48s)]
*  going to show up in this election. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=365.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=367.8s)]
*  If you voted in four out of the last four elections, there's a 90 plus percent chance [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=368.03999999999996s)]
*  you're showing up in this election, as long as you're physically able to do so. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=372.52s)]
*  The next, and by the way, that group of voters, that's somewhere around 60% of the [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=377.92s)]
*  electorate, right? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=383.36s)]
*  So they're the biggest share, but just over a majority. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=384.4s)]
*  And then another 30-ish percent fall into the category. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=390.4s)]
*  They voted in anywhere from one to three of the last four elections. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=393.64000000000004s)]
*  And then the final bucket, which is the smallest bucket, are people who said [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=397.96000000000004s)]
*  they've registered since 2022. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=401.84000000000003s)]
*  So they weren't able to vote in any of those four elections. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=403.88s)]
*  Now, the one consistent for me through this last poll we did in September is those [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=407.12s)]
*  most engaged voters were voting for the Democrat, whether that's Biden or Harris [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=414.16s)]
*  by four points. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=418.48s)]
*  And that goes to kind of the makeup of that electorate, which we know is it's an [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=419.52s)]
*  older group. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=426.24s)]
*  It is whiter than average, right? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=427.68s)]
*  It's less diverse than the overall electorate. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=430.71999999999997s)]
*  And it's probably going to be more college educated than the overall electorate. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=433.92s)]
*  And these are the voters that are propelling and have propelled Democrats to success in [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=440.88s)]
*  2018, in 2020, but certainly most, I think, most notably in 2022. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=448.23999999999995s)]
*  And if those were the only voters that turned out in this election, that would be pretty [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=458.23999999999995s)]
*  good news for Kamala Harris to be ahead by four points in the battleground states, right? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=462.71999999999997s)]
*  This isn't nationally, this is a battleground state. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=467.03999999999996s)]
*  But then you put in those low-propensity voters, and Trump has about a seven-point lead [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=469.35999999999996s)]
*  with those voters. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=475.03999999999996s)]
*  His lead among them has varied between five and ten points. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=476.16s)]
*  And those voters, again, not surprisingly, younger, they are going to identify more as [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=481.04s)]
*  independent, more diverse in terms of the electorate. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=489.76000000000005s)]
*  And what's funny, Dan, is when you and I came up in politics, we would look at that [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=493.04s)]
*  group of voters, we'd say younger, more diverse. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=497.04s)]
*  Those are Democrats. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=500.56s)]
*  You just need to get them out to vote. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=502.32000000000005s)]
*  Right now, they're leaning more to Trump. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=506.0s)]
*  Now, I don't know, I think a big piece of his success has been from the, really from [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=509.76s)]
*  the very beginning, from 2016, is turning out people who are not traditional voters, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=518.4s)]
*  right? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=523.36s)]
*  People who are either tuned out of politics or who are really cynical about politics. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=523.68s)]
*  And so if we think about, all right, what's motivating those voters and how does Harris [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=530.9599999999999s)]
*  sort of shop into that group of voters? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=541.12s)]
*  You know, some of them are going to be motivated by something that she does or says that also [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=544.7199999999999s)]
*  feels like it's different, like she is going after the status quo as well, that she's [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=553.12s)]
*  skeptical of, you know, a lot of the institutions out there. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=559.52s)]
*  And so her message, when I see her message on things like, you know, we're taking on [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=566.56s)]
*  price gouging, we're taking on big pharma, right? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=574.64s)]
*  It is aimed at a lot of the voters out there who are in that camp of, yeah, I'm the little [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=578.48s)]
*  guy, I'm getting picked on by the big guy. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=586.64s)]
*  Where Trump wins them over, of course, is by saying, I am the great disrupter. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=589.52s)]
*  I am not beholden to anyone or anything. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=594.48s)]
*  I am unlike any other politician and that makes me able to do things that no other [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=598.16s)]
*  politician's been able to do. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=604.16s)]
*  It's very interesting you say, like the reversal in the parties I had, I was interviewing, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=606.3199999999999s)]
*  which is an awkward experience for me, but I was interviewing David Plouffe last week, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=610.48s)]
*  and he was making a space about it. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=613.4399999999999s)]
*  And it is like an out of body experience because that was the Obama coalition. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=615.9200000000001s)]
*  That was the argument against Obama's electability both in the primaries and the [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=620.8000000000001s)]
*  general was relying on all these young people. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=623.6s)]
*  Young people never vote. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=625.44s)]
*  And they turn out. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=626.5600000000001s)]
*  But what is interesting, though, is like we knew that challenge and we built a campaign [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=627.12s)]
*  to account for that. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=632.08s)]
*  A massive volunteer driven feared organization we had, you know, we had organized everywhere. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=632.96s)]
*  And the Trump folks are taking a very different approach. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=637.76s)]
*  Like they don't have a traditional food organization. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=640.8000000000001s)]
*  They have outsourced it to Elon Musk and others. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=643.44s)]
*  I'm sure you're hearing plenty of concerns, as everyone does from Republicans, about the [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=646.96s)]
*  status of that. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=650.48s)]
*  What have you heard? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=651.12s)]
*  That's right. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=651.9200000000001s)]
*  You know, I do hear that it's not as loud as say it was in 2020 when there was a lot of [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=653.2s)]
*  hand wringing about the fact that Trump was actively discouraging people from doing mail [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=661.2s)]
*  in voting. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=666.1600000000001s)]
*  You know, I would talk to folks in Pennsylvania who are like, you know, we the mail in vote [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=667.0400000000001s)]
*  piece, we're trying to put a mail in vote program in place, but we are getting pushback [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=673.5200000000001s)]
*  from the very people who are supposed to be helping us institute it because Trump told [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=678.8800000000001s)]
*  them that it was it was rigged. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=683.7600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=686.8000000000001s)]
*  So they are now doing more of a an outside groups are doing more of a mail in process [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=687.2800000000001s)]
*  with their voters. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=696.32s)]
*  Now, does that mean they're picking up those low propensity voters with the mail in program? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=697.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=701.6800000000001s)]
*  That's a that is a very, that is very, very good question. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=702.72s)]
*  And, you know, it also comes back to look, how much do you believe that the reason that, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=707.76s)]
*  say, Trump did better in 2020 than many expected was because they did doors and and traditional [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=718.48s)]
*  field and Democrats did not. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=726.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=728.4s)]
*  I mean, I'm not here to say that field doesn't matter or that all those people who are working [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=728.96s)]
*  really hard on both sides, on the ground, going to doors, that it doesn't make a difference. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=734.0s)]
*  What I wonder, though, is whether what Trump has has shown time and time again is his ability [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=740.08s)]
*  to infiltrate into areas of the electorate that nobody else can. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=746.88s)]
*  No traditional politician can is what allows him to, you know, get turnout among voters, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=753.76s)]
*  even without the quote unquote traditional field programs. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=765.28s)]
*  It's really interesting because in 16 and 20, 16 in particular, his turnout, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=770.2399999999999s)]
*  the sort of his turnout boost was primarily among white, non-college educated, primarily [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=775.76s)]
*  rural voters who are true, who are profiled, they come from Republican parts of the country. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=780.48s)]
*  They they profiles Republican. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=783.6800000000001s)]
*  They adjust not. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=785.2s)]
*  There were people who found Mitt Romney to be not someone who could speak to them. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=786.4s)]
*  And Trump could. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=789.12s)]
*  We can probably spend six years trying to understand why that is. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=790.0s)]
*  But that is the case here. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=792.88s)]
*  He's trying to do something a little bit different is he's trying to get people who [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=794.8000000000001s)]
*  are come from Democratic parts of the country in some cases who are have agreed with Democrats [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=799.6800000000001s)]
*  on some issues to do it. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=805.2s)]
*  So it's just it's interesting. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=806.48s)]
*  They were obviously not going to. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=807.6s)]
*  No, it's really I know it. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=808.24s)]
*  And this is the really fascinating question, right? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=810.0s)]
*  Which is I mean, if you I was just looking through today, the support that Trump is getting [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=812.32s)]
*  from black voters, right? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=820.32s)]
*  And and, you know, he's getting somewhere like 20% of black men now. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=823.04s)]
*  That's nationally. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=831.84s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=833.12s)]
*  You know, you'd have to get into some of the cross tabs of these other polls to see how [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=834.08s)]
*  he's doing in states like Georgia, et cetera. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=839.12s)]
*  But essentially what the polls seem to be telling us and the reason that Trump is doing [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=841.68s)]
*  better in Georgia, let's say, than in Pennsylvania or in Wisconsin is that exact thing, Dan, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=846.88s)]
*  is that he's doing that much better with black voters. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=855.04s)]
*  And I would assume that it's going to be with black men. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=858.48s)]
*  The thing that I keep coming back to, and I know your conversation with with David Plouffe [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=860.8s)]
*  kind of centered on this too, is this idea of, you know, looking at Trump's vote share [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=865.84s)]
*  rather than focusing on the margin. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=874.5600000000001s)]
*  So I was just looking at, for example, the Pew poll out from early October. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=877.44s)]
*  And if you look at the support that Donald Trump is getting from, say, men under 50 in 2020, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=886.96s)]
*  Biden won those voters by 10 men under 50. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=898.96s)]
*  And right now, Trump is only losing them by one. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=902.48s)]
*  So that's, you know, a nine point swing. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=906.32s)]
*  But if you look just at the share of the vote that Trump is getting from those voters, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=909.28s)]
*  it's not any different. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=914.64s)]
*  I can't remember the exact number. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=915.68s)]
*  Let's call it 39%. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=916.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=920.0799999999999s)]
*  And now he's getting 40% of those voters. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=920.4s)]
*  So what you have is a whole chunk of younger voters who are sitting out there who are not [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=923.04s)]
*  committed to Trump, but they're not giving their votes to Harris yet either. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=929.12s)]
*  And that goes to this point about who would you rather be in this scenario? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=933.5999999999999s)]
*  Would you rather be the Harris campaign, who's basically, then it seems like their challenge [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=938.2399999999999s)]
*  is getting those voters to come out for them rather than sitting at home instead of worrying [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=945.2s)]
*  about whether those voters are going to actually go to Donald Trump. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=952.88s)]
*  In other words, he is looking stronger with those voters in part because Harris's numbers [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=956.4000000000001s)]
*  look that much weaker than where Biden was at the end of 2020. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=962.8000000000001s)]
*  And so that's the thing that I keep sort of grappling with to your point about like, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=967.76s)]
*  well, what does this really, really look like? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=973.12s)]
*  And how many of these people actually do come out and go to the polls? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=976.32s)]
*  So I think there is a real underperformance for Harris at this moment. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=980.88s)]
*  But what we don't know is if that's going to result in an overperformance at the end of the day by Trump. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=987.28s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=995.52s)]
*  This is such a confusing election in so many ways. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=997.6800000000001s)]
*  But one of the ways is that I think in order to adjust for the anti-Trump polling error last time, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1001.4399999999999s)]
*  is everyone is trying to, most people are trying to model their vision of the 2024 [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1009.12s)]
*  electorate based on the 2020 electorate. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1017.04s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1018.56s)]
*  We're getting to the very esoteric debate about whether you weight your poll based on [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1020.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1023.2s)]
*  the past people voted in 2020. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1023.92s)]
*  And that could be right, that could be wrong, but that was in itself a Black Swan election [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1027.92s)]
*  because of the pandemic. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1033.68s)]
*  And the changes in voting behavior turnout was so high. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1035.36s)]
*  And so it's just the margins and the vote share and how this actually looks is there is this feeling [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1038.96s)]
*  and I've never seen an election where so few people are confident in saying anything about [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1044.16s)]
*  what could possibly happen. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1048.32s)]
*  Because we're all just we're on a very, we're on a very rickety ledge with how we're looking [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1049.2s)]
*  at it's possible that how we're thinking about it and how we're and it's been so long, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1055.52s)]
*  like even 16 was a very bizarre election too. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1061.6s)]
*  Low turnout relative, huge third party participation that tilted these states. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1063.68s)]
*  Then you have 2020 and now here we are with a brand new candidate who started four months ago [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1068.72s)]
*  that they keep, you know, there's never been a less known candidate this close to the end. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1073.2s)]
*  You know, growing up in politics, you always say, well, all right, what's a presidential election [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1077.2s)]
*  about? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1081.28s)]
*  Do you want to stay the course or do you want to go in a different direction? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1081.84s)]
*  And what's fascinating about this election is we have the guy who is the challenger. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1085.0400000000002s)]
*  So the different direction is the semi incumbent, right? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1090.4s)]
*  People, this is not brand new to anybody about what direction he wants to go in and what it [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1094.24s)]
*  would be like to have a term with him in office. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1098.24s)]
*  And then you have Harris, who's also new. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1103.52s)]
*  As you said, people don't, there's still a lot to fill in about her. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1106.8000000000002s)]
*  And yet she's the incumbent and having to defend the status quo. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1111.2s)]
*  So you can't really put either one of them cleanly into that. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1114.96s)]
*  I'm the change candidate. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1118.88s)]
*  They are both trying to grab onto that. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1120.96s)]
*  And then they both have their past, their past votes, their past behaviors that are [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1123.44s)]
*  tethering them to this idea that they're really not change. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1129.1200000000001s)]
*  So I think that's what's also hard about it because you're right. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1133.8400000000001s)]
*  If you were in a cave, Dan, for the last 10 years, or maybe let's not call it a cave. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1137.44s)]
*  Let's say you were just in a luxurious, wonderful place for 10 years. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1144.48s)]
*  You knew nothing about our politics. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1148.0s)]
*  The last campaign you did was 2008 and you came out and you said, and I told you there's [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1150.32s)]
*  an incumbent president not running again, but with an approval rating in the 40s. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1157.04s)]
*  And we're coming off really high inflationary period where people are still pretty [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1162.0s)]
*  frustrated about the state of the economy. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1166.88s)]
*  Oh, and 70% of people think the country's headed in the wrong direction. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1170.5600000000002s)]
*  Do you think that incumbent party would win? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1174.3200000000002s)]
*  You'd be like, no, probably not. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1176.8000000000002s)]
*  I mean, I'd rather be the out party. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1178.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1181.1200000000001s)]
*  If that was a poli sci 101 test and you wrote yes, the incumbent party. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1181.3600000000001s)]
*  I think that's just an, no one knows what's going to happen, but there is this, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1186.64s)]
*  you can hear it in some of the critiques that's happening. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1190.72s)]
*  Like this is a race that Kamala Harris should be running away with. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1192.56s)]
*  Now put aside that bespeaks a real misunderstanding of how polarization works [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1194.48s)]
*  and how the electoral college works, but even then on paper, this is Trump's election to. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1199.68s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1205.28s)]
*  That's right. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1206.16s)]
*  And she's being asked to do something unprecedented to go from a standing start to [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1206.64s)]
*  running against not just some random schmoe nominated by the Republican Iowa caucus, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1215.3600000000001s)]
*  but by the former incumbent president of the United States running again. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1220.48s)]
*  And so it just, I think are every, a lot of sort of the, the framework of analysis [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1225.1200000000001s)]
*  that's come to this election, I think is off because Trump is such a unique figure. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1231.3600000000001s)]
*  But when you do the fundamentals and it's interesting because of the fundamentals of [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1234.72s)]
*  the political environment, massively favor Trump for all the reasons you said, we can put aside [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1238.08s)]
*  the fact that unemployment is at a historic low, but anybody because of inflation, because of [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1242.72s)]
*  Biden's approval rating, because of the wrong direction number, but the fundamentals of her [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1247.6s)]
*  candidacy favor her, right? She's more popular and in general, in a normal world, you would, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1250.8s)]
*  she's significantly more popular. You would say undecided break for the better like candidate. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1256.56s)]
*  You would say she has, who has more money, who has a better campaign and a better organization. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1262.1599999999999s)]
*  So she is, so it is like these two big, you know, these, these two forces going against each other, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1267.1999999999998s)]
*  right? It, it between the political environment for Trump and the candidacy and the candidate [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1272.32s)]
*  skills for her. Yeah. And that, and that makes, right, that makes it all the harder to figure out [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1276.08s)]
*  where these last batch of people who are not yet committed to voting slash committed to a candidate [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1283.6799999999998s)]
*  are going to, you know, what is it that's going to push those voters over the edge? And, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1292.8s)]
*  you know, again, in the old days, you'd say, well, there's going to be, you know, what is it? What [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1300.24s)]
*  are we, what's the issue environment going into the last three weeks of this election again? And [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1304.48s)]
*  who is that going to favor? So, I mean, there's a lot that's happened. And we've had two assassination [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1310.64s)]
*  attempts on one candidate. We have a growing war in the Middle East. We've got, you know, let's see, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1318.16s)]
*  major disasters, natural disasters in North Carolina and Florida. None of those things alone [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1328.8s)]
*  are making much of a dent in terms of the race, in terms of the just the overall polling or the [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1338.48s)]
*  sense that, oh, this is a political environment that is going to be beneficial to one candidate [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1345.1200000000001s)]
*  or the other. There's so much about the October surprise. What's the October surprise? Maybe we [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1351.68s)]
*  already had it when we had two hurricanes first week of October. But what's different now is not [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1355.44s)]
*  only do we have this small group of voters inside this election, but the media environment is so [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1360.64s)]
*  different now. Like I think all the time about 2004 and the last weekend when that audio tape of [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1366.56s)]
*  Bin Laden came out and leading every newspaper, every news story was about Bin Laden pledging to [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1371.76s)]
*  attack America again. And I don't know whether John Kerry would have wanted that had not come out, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1378.56s)]
*  but that definitely puts in people's head an issue. This is a security election. Exactly. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1382.4s)]
*  Let's move into the Senate. The narrative is that the Democratic chance of holding the Senate has [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1388.88s)]
*  gone way down. This was spurred in large part by your publication, the Cook Political Report, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1392.96s)]
*  moving John Tester from a toss up race to a lean Republican race. How do you see the overall Senate [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1399.2800000000002s)]
*  map right now? And I assume you agree with that assessment. Yeah, it is. You know, look, this was [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1405.76s)]
*  always going to be a challenging map for Democrats. We've known that since the very beginning of the [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1411.92s)]
*  cycle. So holding on to three red states in a presidential year is tough. Tester's challenge [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1417.2s)]
*  in Montana is even a little bit harder than, say, Jared Brown's challenge in Ohio, because [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1424.24s)]
*  Trump is going to win the state of Montana by probably twice as much as he will win Ohio. So [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1433.2s)]
*  for Tester to win, he's going to need to get one in five Trump voters or something like that. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1441.04s)]
*  I think there was a time, again, going back, I feel like this old person now, back in my day, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1447.2s)]
*  but where Montana was a more parochial place and where you could be a Max Baucus, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1452.16s)]
*  a John Tester, where you are a Montana Democrat, you are distinguished by people in that state from [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1459.84s)]
*  national Democrats, in part because of your voting record, but also how you look and act, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1467.68s)]
*  right? The farmer and the buzz cut and the whole deal, which in an era of more nationalized politics [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1474.24s)]
*  and in a state that is growing really, really quickly. I think the number now is only half the [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1482.72s)]
*  people who are in Montana right now were actually born there. And so that makes it really hard for [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1489.44s)]
*  Tester to outrun the national environment like he was able to do in previous years. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1497.2s)]
*  I think the remarkable thing to watch though is how well-shared Brown has been holding on in a [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1503.8400000000001s)]
*  state that Trump's probably going to carry by 10 points. And I think some of that is Brown's own [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1509.6000000000001s)]
*  brand. But the fact that he has been able to outspend and in fact, went on the air early, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1516.4s)]
*  and his Republican opponent was dark for a good chunk of the summer, allowing Brown to really [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1525.28s)]
*  control the narrative around this race. Now, at the end of the day, Moreno may be able to just [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1532.16s)]
*  count on a strong Trump performance to pull him up over the line. So it's not as dangerous to [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1538.24s)]
*  be trailing an incumbent like Moreno is right now or be tied with an incumbent as it would be [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1546.16s)]
*  in a purple state or a bluer state. So you put those three states in really dangerous territory. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1558.48s)]
*  That means that Democrats are going to have to find two states. Or if we just say Montana is the [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1568.0s)]
*  only one that flips, they've got to pick up one state and Harris win the presidency in order to [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1573.92s)]
*  hold the Senate. And if we look at the map, we see Texas coming in there. Nebraska has been quite the [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1580.3200000000002s)]
*  surprise, even though he is not technically a Democrat. He's an independent who hasn't said [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1586.96s)]
*  who he's going to caucus with. But it would definitely make the politics of the Senate even [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1592.8000000000002s)]
*  more interesting should you have another independent in there. But look, I think [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1600.16s)]
*  Colin Allred has run a very, very strong race in Texas, driven in part by the fact that it is, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1606.8000000000002s)]
*  as we've seen since 2018, if you're a Democrat running against Ted Cruz, you can raise a lot [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1613.76s)]
*  of money. Ted Cruz raises you a lot of money. Just out of sheer spite, people like to donate to people [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1620.48s)]
*  running against Cruz. And Texas generally don't like, right? Exactly. So it's, you know, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1630.3200000000002s)]
*  already I'm not taking anything away from him. But if you're running against Ted Cruz, there's a lot [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1636.4s)]
*  of money sitting out there from people who just don't like Ted Cruz. But that's still a tough, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1642.3200000000002s)]
*  that's a tough haul to get from, you know, 46, 47% as a Democrat to 50 in the state of Texas. Every [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1647.92s)]
*  1% is just brutal. Yeah. And it's going to depend a lot on what happens with a Latino vote, right? Are [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1657.6s)]
*  we snapping back some to where we were before 2020? Are we staying at 2020? And is there erosion? [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1666.08s)]
*  Back in my day, it was Texas is on its inexorable path to be a state because of the margins Obama [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1674.24s)]
*  and then Hillary were getting with Latino voters. Then that changed after 2020. And now we are in a [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1680.8s)]
*  much different place. Would you have a feel for Nebraska? I've never seen a place race for people. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1686.72s)]
*  There's been such conflicting polling. And like there are some polls that showed incredibly close. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1692.32s)]
*  I've seen polls that not the highest of quality polls I think that have shown, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1696.56s)]
*  they've shown the Democrat and shown Dan Osborne ahead. I've seen polls that have shown huge leads [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1701.68s)]
*  for Fisher. I think you guys have Fisher as a lean Republican or is that right? Yeah, I think we [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1707.04s)]
*  have it in likely right now. Yeah. Yeah. And this feels in some ways, it feels somewhat familiar. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1712.8s)]
*  We've seen this in other plains states. We saw it in Kansas, right? With Pat Roberts, where [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1722.08s)]
*  an independent candidate who was really a Democrat but ran as an independent, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1728.56s)]
*  it got very close until it wasn't close at all. And so there's a formula here for a Republican to, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1733.2s)]
*  you just have to make the case that this person who calls themselves an independent is actually [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1741.36s)]
*  aligned with the Democrat, make it a national partisan race. And you pull out a win. I think [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1745.84s)]
*  Osborne has been successful for a couple of reasons. The first is he just doesn't look or act like [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1752.0s)]
*  your typical politician. The fact that he's not aligned with the party, I think helps. He's a [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1757.36s)]
*  former labor leader and has a good story to tell. And Fisher, I think is not as particularly well [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1763.04s)]
*  known and not well defined in that state. So he kind of snuck up on her. It's hard to sneak up [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1772.6399999999999s)]
*  on a Senator, right? They have six years to prepare for this thing. It's hard to sneak up [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1779.76s)]
*  on anybody in politics these days, but he did just that. And so, look, at the end of the day, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1784.8s)]
*  it is still Nebraska. But the fact that this race is where it is, it's also notable that his last [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1792.24s)]
*  name is Osborne. Now, you may remember there was a very famous football coach named Tom Osborne, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1800.4s)]
*  the football coach for the University of Nebraska, who he had an E at the end of his name. This [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1807.84s)]
*  Osborne does not, who was also a member of Congress. So the name Osborne in Nebraska is actually, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1812.8s)]
*  it's a good name. It's a good brand to have. So I don't know how much of it he's benefiting there. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1820.0s)]
*  But it is clear that he's picking up some level of support from people who are also voting for [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1827.76s)]
*  Donald Trump, right? The kinds of people who I think would say, yeah, I like Donald Trump because [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1836.64s)]
*  he shakes it up and he's not one of the insiders. This guy seems like a not insider-y kind of guy [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1843.12s)]
*  to me too. And she's part of the system and part of the establishment, so to speak. So yeah, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1849.36s)]
*  every year you've got one of these races, there's usually one in the house too, or an incumbent that [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1856.2399999999998s)]
*  nobody was paying attention to, all of a sudden looks like they are in a lot of trouble. And [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1861.36s)]
*  the money is starting to flow to her, but he has been able to raise an incredible amount of money. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1869.68s)]
*  And this is where the nationalization of politics actually helps candidates because a candidate in [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1876.56s)]
*  Nebraska is now able to raise money from people around the country in a way you couldn't back in [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1882.72s)]
*  the pre-internet, pre-yeah. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1889.3600000000001s)]
*  There's no grassroots money for a new Nebraska Senate candidate. You're just counting on [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1892.8s)]
*  PACs to decide whether your side is going to be the majority or not. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1896.8s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1901.28s)]
*  So let's talk about the house. In all the various models I've seen, Democrats have a slight [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1901.9199999999998s)]
*  or slight favorites to take the house. I find the house fascinating because we spent some time [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1908.96s)]
*  talking about the red states there, but the Senate map mostly overlays over the presidential map. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1914.6399999999999s)]
*  And so the same trends are affecting Kamala Harris in Wisconsin or affecting Tammy Baldwin [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1920.0s)]
*  in Wisconsin, same thing for Bob Casey and Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1924.3200000000002s)]
*  So there's a lot of that. The house is very different. There are obviously some [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1927.2s)]
*  battleground house districts in Pennsylvania and states like that, but it's really going to be [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1930.4s)]
*  decided in New York and California. Two states were kind of underperformed in 2022. What do you [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1935.04s)]
*  guys think of the house? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1941.2s)]
*  Well, I'm really glad you brought up New York and California because the one thing we're noticing [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1942.5600000000002s)]
*  in both of those states, which you're right, if you look at, if I told you that, look, Democrats [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1947.44s)]
*  chances run through California and New York in a presidential year, normally you'd say, well, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1953.04s)]
*  that's great for Democrats because those are two great states for us. And certainly we'll have [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1958.48s)]
*  higher turnout than we did in 2022, which was a weird year. And you have an unpopular governor [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1964.0s)]
*  in New York and a not very inspired top of the ticket race in California. And so we had really [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1969.84s)]
*  low turnout. At the same time, we're seeing, at least right now, that there's still some sign that [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1975.04s)]
*  Republican, I don't know if I would call it momentum, but Republican success in New York [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1987.12s)]
*  and California wasn't just about low turnout in 2022. This is especially true if you're looking at [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=1994.6399999999999s)]
*  the districts that Democrats need to pick off in California where you have a significant Latino [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2002.56s)]
*  population. It goes back to that question of how well will Trump and Republicans do with Latino [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2007.9199999999998s)]
*  voters in a presidential election cycle compared to, say, an off year? Again, in the not so distant [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2015.6s)]
*  past, you would say, oh, if it's an overwhelmingly Latino district, it will perform better for [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2027.52s)]
*  Democrats in a presidential year than in a midterm year. But you can't take that to the bank now, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2033.52s)]
*  not certainly with where we've seen some of these trends with Latino voters going. And in New York, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2039.04s)]
*  the redrawing of the map that Democrats did didn't really do much to harm Republicans. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2047.92s)]
*  It shored up a couple of their Democrats, which, you know, playing defense is important too. But [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2055.44s)]
*  there still are signs that Long Island and some of the places in upstate, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2064.4s)]
*  slash Hudson Valley, they're not going to perform as well for Harris as they did for Biden. At least [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2070.0s)]
*  they're not right now. Again, it doesn't mean Harris loses these places. It's just that instead [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2077.6800000000003s)]
*  of winning them by 10 or 12, it's, you know, six or four. And that means that these challengers, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2082.96s)]
*  you know, they have a bit of a tailwind, but not as strong of a tailwind as you would expect. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2095.12s)]
*  To me, it's also like, you know, you've got some quirky races in there too. We've got [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2102.08s)]
*  Democrats holding on in red places and they look pretty strong now. Marcy Kaptur in Toledo, who was [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2108.96s)]
*  supposed to be toast. Absolutely. They drew her a terrible district and she's still holding on. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2117.92s)]
*  And you've got Matt Cartwright in another district that has shifted dramatically to the right. He's [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2126.0s)]
*  still holding on. Jared Golden, I haven't seen any data up there recently, but you know, up in Maine. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2135.2799999999997s)]
*  So the incumbent Democrats in those red districts are holding on too. And so to me, it's really [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2143.3599999999997s)]
*  where Democrats are defending some of these open seats, like in Michigan. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2153.2s)]
*  Let's just lock in seat. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2158.08s)]
*  Those are those two, the Slock and seat and the Kildee seat up there. Those are going to be [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2158.96s)]
*  critically important. Abigail Spanberger's district in Virginia. Normally these races, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2167.04s)]
*  the closest races all break one way. So you see our toss up category, usually, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2174.72s)]
*  I think we have 24 in there and usually 70% of the races would go one direction or the other. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2181.52s)]
*  So that still may happen in this case, but you're right, they're all in different areas. So you [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2188.08s)]
*  could see something like, yeah, the New York races go one way, the California races go one way, but [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2194.08s)]
*  North Carolina and Ohio and Michigan go a different way. So it makes for a [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2201.28s)]
*  really close, close call on who has an advantage here. And if these things play out the way they [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2211.76s)]
*  have in recent years, where the top of the ticket is as important as the, it's not more important, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2224.4s)]
*  but it is incredibly important to what happens below, you know, the races below it, you know, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2233.52s)]
*  outrunning your presidential nominee becomes really challenging. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2240.24s)]
*  And it's interesting because in the Senate, in a lot of the races, you're seeing [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2245.6s)]
*  Senate Democratic candidates outrun Harris. Now, I think that's narrowed some. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2249.12s)]
*  It's definitely narrowed some. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2253.52s)]
*  In Wisconsin and Pennsylvania in particular. And I think there's kind of unique situations in [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2254.8799999999997s)]
*  Arizona. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2260.24s)]
*  Arizona and Nevada. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2260.72s)]
*  In particular, in Nevada and a little bit in Michigan, I think, because Mike Rogers is not, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2261.8399999999997s)]
*  he has some challenges in reinventing himself as a Trump Republican. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2268.64s)]
*  CNN contributors to Trump Republican is a tough pivot over the course of a couple of years [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2274.16s)]
*  with a way station and living in Florida, I think, to get there. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2278.64s)]
*  But you're seeing them come together. And so I guess you would say the most likely scenario is [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2282.24s)]
*  the winner of the presidential wins the House as well. That's probably what you would expect. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2287.12s)]
*  That's what we have seen forever and ever and ever. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2290.7999999999997s)]
*  But wouldn't this be the right year for that to be abended? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2294.08s)]
*  And so we have a whole bunch of this has never happened before scenarios that could happen, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2299.12s)]
*  which is a double flip, right? The Senate and the House going different ways. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2305.6s)]
*  You could see that the presidential goes one way and the House goes the other, which, again, [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2311.2s)]
*  haven't seen. I think the last time the House flipped control in a presidential year [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2318.24s)]
*  was in the 1950s. So Eisenhower was president the last time that happened. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2325.6s)]
*  I think the one thing we can feel somewhat confident in is that we're not going to get [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2331.04s)]
*  an answer on election night, the day after the election, or maybe two days after the election. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2336.72s)]

*  It could be weeks, frankly, as it was in 2018. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2345.2799999999997s)]
*  And then if it's really close, then we're going to have recounts on top of recounts. So that should [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2348.96s)]

*  Dan, I'm happy to be here on Pod Save. I was told by Elijah to downplay my banter by 50%. So if you [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2421.44s)]
*  guys want full. You know what that means? I want you to double your banter. Okay. So we have a few [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2427.68s)]
*  questions here from the discord. The first one we got asked many, many times. So I'm eagerly [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2432.7999999999997s)]
*  awaiting your answer. CNN was reporting on record early voting in Georgia. And Dan, you previously [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2438.3199999999997s)]
*  have talked about that the more people that vote, the better it probably is for Trump. What are these [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2444.48s)]
*  early voting numbers saying? Do not read anything into this. Early vote is we spend a [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2450.16s)]
*  lot of time trying to parse early vote numbers and it tells us very little because this could mean [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2457.6s)]
*  really high turnout or it could mean that a lot of people who had previously voted [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2463.6s)]
*  on election day have decided that for the purposes of convenience to vote early vote. So you're not [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2470.56s)]
*  adding any new voters. Turnouts may not necessarily be any higher. You're just shifting from election [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2476.72s)]
*  day voters to early vote voters. Also, how enthusiastic people are. They will often just [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2481.36s)]
*  vote on the first day as early vote and vote in mail becomes more normalized in this country. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2486.08s)]
*  You're going to have more people doing that. It could tell us something great. It could tell us [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2490.88s)]
*  something terrible. We just don't know. Over the course of time, the campaigns will be able to [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2493.84s)]
*  analyze, take the number of who voted, run it through their database and determine whether these [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2498.24s)]
*  are just typical voters who were going to vote anyway and now they're voting early. Are they new [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2503.12s)]
*  voters? People who we did not think were going to vote. Are they low propensity voters that we were [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2507.04s)]
*  hoping to get to the polls? But based on what we know right now, you can't really read into it one [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2511.2s)]
*  thing good or bad. Great answer to that question. We don't know. But don't freak out. Here's another [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2515.2s)]
*  question. I saw that Republicans have completely outpaced Democrats in voter registration in swing [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2520.08s)]
*  states. How much should we be worried about this? How much is it due to people changing the [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2525.9199999999996s)]
*  registration to match their 2020 preferences versus a legitimate operation to recruit more [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2530.0s)]
*  Republicans? It is something to worry about. Now, I would state that for a long time, people [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2535.2s)]
*  don't change their voter registration. They may have registered as a Democrat when Bill Clinton [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2541.92s)]
*  was President and they've been voting Republican ever since, but they've remained a Democrat because [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2548.16s)]
*  they don't vote in primaries. So there's no point in changing registration. You will often see [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2551.36s)]
*  in an election where there's no primary on one side and a presidential primary on the other, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2557.12s)]
*  the side having the presidential primary will usually gain registrants because people will [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2561.28s)]
*  register to participate in the primary through the registered independents who have always voted [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2565.52s)]
*  Republican, maybe even a few Democrats who register as Republicans to vote in that primary. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2569.84s)]
*  And so, look, you want to have more registered voters. Democrats for a long time had a huge edge. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2576.0s)]
*  That edge was larger than our typical edge in statewide races. So there were some people who [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2580.48s)]
*  were registered as Democrats but voting as Republicans. But it's not as bad as it sounds, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2585.1200000000003s)]
*  but in general, you want to be gaining more registrants, not losing your advantage. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2590.48s)]
*  Okay. People are asking very extensive questions on this discord, which is great, [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2594.96s)]
*  but reading these are quite a mouthful. That's why you should subscribe to Friends of the Pot [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2598.88s)]
*  and join the discord because there's some really smart people asking smart questions. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2602.32s)]
*  They really are. Should the Democrats prioritize energizing their base rather than focusing heavily [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2604.8s)]
*  on swing voters? This is how the press portrays swing voters. The avatar of the swing voter [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2610.96s)]
*  in traditional political media narratives is usually a white man or woman in their 40s to 50s [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2618.6400000000003s)]
*  in Wisconsin. They go to a diner, they print out the white papers of the Republicans and the [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2627.12s)]
*  white papers of the Democrats, and they go through them to see whose policies would benefit them more. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2631.6s)]
*  And that's not what... There are some voters like that. They're definitely... I don't know [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2636.3199999999997s)]
*  about the printing out of things anymore, but there are people choosing between Trump and [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2640.88s)]
*  Harris. That does exist. But the largest swath of quote unquote swing voters or persuasion targets [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2644.3199999999997s)]
*  are people choosing between your candidate and the couch. People who don't like Donald Trump, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2649.44s)]
*  they kind of like Kamala Harris, but they don't know if politics works for them. And so that is [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2654.32s)]
*  who both campaigns are actually focusing on. Trump is not focusing on his base. To the extent they [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2658.0s)]
*  have any sort of GOTV operation, it is to try to get low engagement voters, people who profile as [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2663.1200000000003s)]
*  Republican, but do not typically vote. And those could be young men are a huge part, including [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2670.2400000000002s)]
*  black and Latino men are a huge part of Trump's target there. Democrats have a much wider swath [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2675.84s)]
*  of voters that we're going to do that with also includes young voters, men and women, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2680.56s)]
*  people who have never voted before who were trying to get registered. And so the idea that [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2685.12s)]
*  swing voters in the base are these two entirely different things, I think is a [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2692.4s)]
*  misnomer born of some pretty lazy political writing over the years. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2696.24s)]
*  Dan, if my memory serves me well, you once said that donating to campaigns directly is more [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2700.4s)]
*  impactful than donating to PACs. Explain further. Yes, your memory does serve you well. And let me [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2706.24s)]
*  I'll offer some context for that. But the reason why donating to campaigns is more [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2714.24s)]
*  cost efficient and effective than donating to PACs is when it comes to television ads, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2720.4799999999996s)]
*  not digital ads, but television ads, the stations are required to offer the lowest available rate [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2726.0s)]
*  to the campaigns themselves. And they can gouge the living shit out of super PACs, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2732.4s)]
*  or any PAC, frankly. And so right now, based on what I've heard, a super PACs are spending five [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2737.84s)]
*  to six times the amount of money per commercial as the Harrison Trump campaigns or congressional [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2744.08s)]
*  and Senate campaigns are paying. And so when it comes to actual, this sort of campaign like super PACs [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2750.08s)]
*  and others that are going to run ads on television, donating to the campaign is much more efficient. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2756.64s)]
*  Now, there are a lot of great organizations, many of them, we support in votes in America, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2761.2s)]
*  who are PACs that do organizing, right? They're going, they're doing deep canvassing, [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2765.7599999999998s)]
*  they're registering voters, they're getting voters to the poll, and those groups pay the same [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2770.16s)]
*  amount of money as per, you know, whatever it is they're buying as the campaign does. But for the [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2773.68s)]
*  purpose of who's spending money on television, give your money to the campaign because that's [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2780.64s)]
*  you're going to get much more bang for your buck that way. Okay, Dan, another question. If you could [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2784.72s)]
*  design your ideal three week out polling that doesn't already exist or isn't publicly shared, [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2789.36s)]
*  and your only budget and scale constraints are that you cannot collect info from any true swing [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2796.48s)]
*  states, what states would you be pulling and what measures and what differentials would you be [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2802.96s)]
*  watching with the greatest degree of interest? What a question. I'm going to simplify that question. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2808.6400000000003s)]
*  I think I would look at there are two states that are not getting a lot of polling that I would like [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2816.32s)]
*  to see poll because I think they tell us something about what could be happening nationally with [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2823.12s)]
*  certain groups. And so one of them is New Mexico. This is a state that was in play when Biden was [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2829.2s)]
*  the nominee, so much so that Trump was leading in some internal campaign polls in New Mexico. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2837.36s)]
*  From the limited polling I've seen, it has reverted back to its relatively safe status [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2843.04s)]
*  from 2020 and before. But I'd like to know that for sure. I'd like to see what's happening there. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2849.1200000000003s)]
*  So much of the election depends on whether Trump can get to 40% of the Latino vote. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2854.96s)]
*  Looking at New Mexico would be a very interesting place to do that. And I think looking at the [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2861.92s)]
*  Latino vote in a state that's not seeing a ton of campaign ads would be helpful to give us some [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2866.6400000000003s)]
*  hint in what's happening in other parts of the country like California and New York, [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2872.3999999999996s)]
*  where you have huge swaths of Latino vote that are going to side the House. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2877.68s)]
*  Then I'd like to see New Jersey. New Jersey is another state that moved towards [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2880.72s)]
*  Trump when Biden was the nominee. It's theoretically snapback. There's almost no [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2889.8399999999997s)]
*  polling there. We have an important Senate race there where Andy Kim is running to take [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2892.8799999999997s)]
*  Bob Menendez's seat as Bob Menendez heads off to prison or wherever he's going. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2897.92s)]
*  In 2021, a Republican almost won the governorship there. A Republican former truck driver who had [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2904.6400000000003s)]
*  no money and ran no real campaign almost beat Governor Phil Murphy. New York has moved a little [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2910.96s)]
*  to the right. I'd like to see if that was happening in New Jersey as well. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2917.04s)]
*  It's an interesting time for your last name to be Menendez. Dan, I had to get that into one episode [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2919.1200000000003s)]
*  of Pod Save America. Okay, Dan, last question, arguably the most important one on stage for [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2924.4s)]
*  39 minutes. What song would you choose to dance to? I don't think I can answer this question. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2929.92s)]
*  All of my dancing is awkwardly swaying. There's no other. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2936.2400000000002s)]
*  What's your ideal song? My ideal song to sway to? [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2939.52s)]
*  Yeah. In front of a really big awkward crowd. Is it going to be the same song for 30 minutes [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2945.44s)]
*  or is it going to be a genre of music? No, it has to be. We're going to put it on repeat. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2949.36s)]
*  One song on repeat for 39 minutes. I don't know. There's no song I'm going to listen to for 39 [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2953.76s)]
*  straight minutes. I would say Bohemian Rhapsody because it's a long song. You're only really [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2964.1600000000003s)]
*  getting it in three times. Is it 13 minutes long? [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2968.32s)]
*  It's pretty long. I don't know if it's 13, but it's quite long. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2972.8s)]
*  Okay. Yeah, I would say I prepared for the differential question. What would my ideal [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2975.6s)]
*  poll be? I did not prepare for it. I would say in my defense, the actual question as submitted, [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2983.68s)]
*  although you edited it, was Dan, if you had to awkwardly sway on stage to an aria. I'm not sure [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2988.96s)]
*  I could name an aria. Ave Maria, I guess, because that's the one Trump did. Okay, I didn't know [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2993.68s)]
*  what that meant. I just slide it right out of rep. You just take the questioners' questions and [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=2997.7599999999998s)]
*  change them to fit what you're interested in. I absolutely can. Okay, Dan, All Too Well, 10-minute [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=3004.8s)]
*  version would be your sway song. Thanks so much for taking Discord questions. Thank you, Discord. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cs5B3pj8Pk&t=3010.6400000000003s)]
