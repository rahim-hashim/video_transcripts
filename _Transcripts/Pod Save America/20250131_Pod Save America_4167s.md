Video Description: Finally, a president willing to blame a devastating air crash on diversity hiring and two of his predecessors! Nearly two weeks into his second term, Trump continues to sow bitterness, fear, and chaos everywhere he turns: issuing a spending freeze so drastic and haphazard that his team has to rescind it after three days, demanding that more than two million federal workers resign or face loyalty tests, and vowing to send 30,000 immigrants to Guantanamo Bay. Meanwhile, three of his most extreme cabinet picks face tough questions in their confirmation hearings—but will it matter? Jon and Dan reflect on a dismal week, what's next, and signs of life in the opposition party. Then, Jon checks in with Senator Chris Murphy about the threats that Democratic leaders are getting, and why it's so important to fight back anyway.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Trump Heals Grieving Nation By Making Deadly DC Plane Crash About DEI
**Pod Save America:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o)
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Jon Favreau. I'm Dan Pfeiffer. On today's show, three of Donald Trump's most extreme cabinet nominees [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=0.0s)]
*  were peppered with questions at their confirmation hearings this week. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=6.88s)]
*  We'll talk about the nuttiest moments and whether any of it will matter in the end. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=9.84s)]
*  We'll also get into the nationwide chaos caused by Trump's [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=15.88s)]
*  spending freeze, which the White House backed away from after a judge blocked the order. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=19.84s)]
*  But even as Trump cut bait on that dangerous and terrible idea, he moved ahead with [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=24.48s)]
*  many more, including forcing every federal employee to resign or face loyalty tests and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=29.48s)]
*  preparing to house thousands of immigrants at Guantanamo Bay. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=35.34s)]
*  What a wonderful country. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  But first, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  we shouldn't have to talk about the plane crash in DC on this show because there [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=43.68s)]
*  usually isn't an immediate political angle to a mid-air collision that hasn't yet been investigated. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=47.8s)]
*  But half the voters decided to make Donald Trump president again, so here we are. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=53.72s)]
*  The American Airlines flight from Wichita was about to land at DCA when it collided with an army helicopter on a training mission, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=58.44s)]
*  killing all 64 people on the plane and three in the helicopter. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=65.12s)]
*  Trump held a press conference the next morning before anyone had any real information about what actually happened. So of course, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=69.36s)]
*  being president, he took the opportunity to console the nation and reassure the public that air travel is safe. Let's listen. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=76.32s)]
*  We do not know what led to this crash, but we have some very strong opinions. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=82.28s)]
*  And ideas, and I think we'll probably state those opinions now. I put safety first. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=87.48s)]
*  Obama, Biden, and the Democrats put policy first. Their policy was horrible, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=92.76s)]
*  and their politics was even worse as they put a big push to put [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=97.82s)]
*  diversity into the FAA's program. And I assume maybe this is the reason. The FAA, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=103.12s)]
*  which is overseen by Secretary Pete [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=110.52s)]
*  Budachev, a [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=113.32s)]
*  real winner. That's the guy, he's a real winner. Do you know how badly everything's run since he's run this Department of Transportation? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=114.84s)]
*  He's a disaster. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=121.16s)]
*  On DEI and the claims that you've made, are you saying this crash was somehow [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=123.16s)]
*  caused and the result of diversity hiring? And what evidence have you seen to support these claims? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=127.0s)]
*  It just could have been. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=132.72s)]
*  That's why I'm trying to figure out how you can come to the conclusion right now that [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=133.92s)]
*  diversity had something to do with this crash. Because I have common sense, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=138.16s)]
*  okay, and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=142.6s)]
*  unfortunately a lot of people don't. He does have common sense. Later in the day [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=144.44s)]
*  he did a press event where he signed a memo to the FAA blaming the crash again on [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=147.84s)]
*  diversity programs under Obama and Biden and ordering the administrator to roll them back. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=152.4s)]
*  So Trump has been president for two weeks, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=157.28s)]
*  signed a record number of executive orders, fired a record number of federal workers, and is blaming his own [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=159.84s)]
*  FAA on the first fatal commercial plane crash on American soil in 16 years. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=166.6s)]
*  Because the FAA says on its website that they want to make sure that people of different backgrounds have equal opportunity to get hired, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=171.24s)]
*  including people with disabilities, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  language that was there during Trump's entire first term. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=180.52s)]
*  I mean, it seems like Trump got what he wanted, which was to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=185.88s)]
*  you know, pick a fight about whether the plane crash was caused by diversity. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=189.56s)]
*  So he got what he wanted because that is what everyone has had to talk about all day, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=195.36s)]
*  arguing about whether the plane crash [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=200.44s)]
*  that has yet to be investigated, the investigation has just started, was caused by [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=202.96s)]
*  diversity. Dan, your thoughts? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=208.88s)]
*  We have to begin with just pointing out and saying out loud [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=215.32s)]
*  just how absolutely disgusting and cynical what Trump did is, right? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=220.12s)]
*  There are upwards of 70 families who are dealing with loss, who are trying to find out what happened. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=225.4s)]
*  There are communities across this country and the world who have lost community members because of this. It is a traumatic [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=230.12s)]
*  thing for the entire nation to deal with when we have a plane crash like this. And instead of [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=237.32s)]
*  consoling people, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=242.88s)]
*  instead of trying to comfort people, what Trump did as he does with every tragedy is [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=244.2s)]
*  immediately try to exploit it for his own gain. And I know we're gonna have this is gonna happen, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=249.6s)]
*  all the time over the next four years. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=254.2s)]
*  I do think we have to continue to call it out when he does it, even if it is only [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=255.76s)]
*  maybe for our benefit. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=259.8s)]
*  But we cannot like, there is something dangerous about allowing this to just become the normal way in which we do things. Just reading some [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=261.0s)]
*  rote [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=268.28s)]
*  pablum that your speech writers wrote for you that you didn't clearly did not care about before launching into this absurd unfounded attack. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=269.4s)]
*  That is not sufficient, right? And which should be, it should be called out for. And I do think [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=276.8s)]
*  we, you say he got the debate because we are all talking about it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=281.32s)]
*  We as a select group of people of which we are part of, the rest of the country did tune in for this, right? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=284.56s)]
*  The plane crash is something that people, gets people who do not pay attention to the news to pay attention to the news. It is when [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=290.35999999999996s)]
*  historically CNN's ratings go way up as during a plane crash because people, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=295.96s)]
*  they fly, they think about flying. It is a big deal. And so people who saw Trump do that today, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=300.2s)]
*  I am not convinced that this is some giant political winner for him to see him doing that hours after the plane crash. And so, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=306.59999999999997s)]
*  like yes, there will be a big debate about DI and we can talk about how Democrats should talk about the plane crash and that [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=313.52s)]
*  going forward. But in the moment, what he did was repellent. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=317.84s)]
*  And I think a lot of people will find it that way. Sarah Longwell had done some focus groups last year early on and [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=322.35999999999996s)]
*  she was talking to some voters in the focus group who said that they were, they didn't like Trump, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=329.47999999999996s)]
*  but they were going to vote for Trump. And I think there's this guy who said, you know, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=335.44s)]
*  I'm just gonna close my eyes for the next four years, not watch them on TV and just enjoy the Trump policies. And [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=339.28s)]
*  the reason that has never been a [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=347.35999999999996s)]
*  real option is [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=351.52s)]
*  because every president faces crises and disasters. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=353.64s)]
*  And I started thinking about this when the fires hit LA a couple weeks ago before he was president and [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=358.08s)]
*  as [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=364.20000000000005s)]
*  people are still fleeing from their homes as we were all figuring out who should evacuate where and we were trying to get alerts. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=365.36s)]
*  Donald Trump [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=372.72s)]
*  immediately kicked off this whole thing blaming Gavin Newsom for the fires, talking about fucking water in Northern California, that bullshit. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=374.24s)]
*  And I thought to myself like this is, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=381.88000000000005s)]
*  this is gonna be the next four years and even in the, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=383.72s)]
*  even in the best case scenario that any of us can imagine with the Trump presidency, right? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=386.72s)]
*  He does a bunch of corruption, still pretty bad, but we all make it, we survive a second term like, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=392.08000000000004s)]
*  there are still gonna be crises, there are gonna be disasters, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=396.48s)]
*  there's gonna be tragedies and when the country tunes in, we're not gonna be able to get good information from him. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=399.6s)]
*  He's going to pick fights with people he doesn't like and his political enemies and blame people and divide people and make people angrier. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=405.32000000000005s)]
*  And he is going to compound [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=411.72s)]
*  every single fucking tragedy that this country faces. And God forbid [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=414.72s)]
*  when there is a crisis that depends on all of us getting good information [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=419.44s)]
*  like there was last time he was president during the fucking pandemic, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=424.03999999999996s)]
*  we're not gonna know what to do because we don't have, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=428.15999999999997s)]
*  the media has been splintered, balkanized, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=431.47999999999996s)]
*  like no one knows where to go for good information. We can't trust our president, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=435.4s)]
*  we can't trust the government because there's a bunch of fucking bozos that are running the government now and [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=439.0s)]
*  you know like last night when this first broke I was like [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=444.8s)]
*  terrified as you all know, very nervous flyer, it's like worst nightmare, you know, and I saw on Twitter immediately [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=448.16s)]
*  some people on the left were like, oh this is Trump's fault because he got at the aviation safety committee last week and [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=456.12s)]
*  also that maybe the freeze affected this and that thing and I thought to myself, look, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=464.16s)]
*  maybe some of this could be true, maybe it's not but like I wouldn't want to say this right now, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=469.32s)]
*  like the plane just crashed. Let's just like have a fucking moment. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=474.24s)]
*  Let's not be like him and not because like we should be nice, you know, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=477.40000000000003s)]
*  like let's if we want to present people with an alternative and with a real choice [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=481.16s)]
*  then that requires not acting like Trump when a disaster happens and like immediately just throwing around accusations without [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=485.40000000000003s)]
*  knowing all the facts and also by the way, like let's give the country and each other a moment to collectively [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=492.12s)]
*  grieve and mourn and also like find out, you know, reliable information and so I was like, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=499.28000000000003s)]
*  oh, it's just like it's so annoying but whatever it's like random accounts on Twitter who the fuck cares and then wake up today, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=504.52000000000004s)]
*  Thursday and the fucking president of the United States is out there. The first thing he does is blame [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=510.88s)]
*  diversity, doesn't even know who the air traffic controllers were, what caused the plane, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=516.8s)]
*  whether it was the air traffic controller's fault, whether it was the FAA's fault, whether it was the pilot's fault, the helicopter's fault [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=521.8s)]
*  or whether it was no one's fault because sometimes tragedies just fucking happen, fires just fucking happen, sometimes just things happen and [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=526.9599999999999s)]
*  like it's just it is, oh, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=534.04s)]
*  it's gonna be a long four years, man. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=536.76s)]
*  Two thoughts on this one, obviously Trump without any evidence as reporters, I think did a very good job of calling out, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=538.52s)]
*  blaming this on [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=545.0s)]
*  diversity, like it's obviously a lie that this is DEI's fault, like Trump doesn't know that, no one knows that and [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=546.5600000000001s)]
*  it's not, it's not how the world works, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=552.5600000000001s)]
*  but it's also the most true thing that Trump and Republicans ever say because what they truly believe is [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=554.28s)]
*  that what makes America weaker is diversity, right? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=559.64s)]
*  That everything that is different from what they view as inherent American culture, right? White male Christian culture [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=563.2s)]
*  makes us weaker, right? It is like probably the most true thing. I think, I think this was Charlie Kirk who tweeted this, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=570.1999999999999s)]
*  I would say I apologize, but I don't if it was someone else, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=575.9599999999999s)]
*  but was if you want to go back to the 50s, you have to get rid of the 60s, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=580.56s)]
*  you have to undo the 60s and that is what this is all about, this idea that [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=584.12s)]
*  like in their mind, they truly believe that any effort that seeks to add diverse points of view, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=588.4s)]
*  diverse backgrounds to an institution, which means that it is less white, less male, is there for a weaker institution, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=595.28s)]
*  like that is what they truly believe. Well, though, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=602.64s)]
*  I mean what they are saying now is, the new thing now is if you are a woman or [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=604.68s)]
*  a black American or Latino or Asian or gay or [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=611.76s)]
*  anything but a white man and you have a [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=617.1999999999999s)]
*  job that is a senior position, whether it is in government or media or politics or anything else, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=620.52s)]
*  you got there because of diversity efforts, because of DEI. There is no way you could have earned that job. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=625.7199999999999s)]
*  It is, they start with you got the job because of DEI [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=631.12s)]
*  and then you have to somehow prove that you did not get the job because of DEI, but that you got it because of merit. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=635.4799999999999s)]
*  I mean that they called Kamala Harris the DEI vice president. Right, that is where they are now. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=641.4s)]
*  The second thing here and this goes a little bit to the politics of this is there was this surreal thing of me sitting on my couch [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=645.32s)]
*  in my house in the middle of the day watching Donald Trump in the briefing room, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=652.2s)]
*  stage managing a press conference with a bunch of fucking adults. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=657.8000000000001s)]
*  Right, I was like back in the 2020 and that is the stuff that people don't like about Trump. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=661.2800000000001s)]
*  Right, when they are tuning in and he is acting like a clown, when he is clearly unable to meet the moment, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=665.9200000000001s)]
*  when he is background noise to low gas prices and cheaper milk, he is fine. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=671.76s)]
*  When he is in your face, when you want information and he is making about himself, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=676.84s)]
*  that is what causes people to take a step back to not like about it and that is what that was today. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=681.56s)]
*  Yeah, and he's got luminaries like Pete Hegseth and JD Vance and Sean Duffy, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=687.88s)]
*  former real world contestant who is now the transportation secretary, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=692.96s)]
*  you know, all parroting the exact same line. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=697.28s)]
*  They are all taken, they all have to take turns going up to the podium and just parroting exactly what Trump said. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=699.16s)]
*  And you know, idiots like Sean Duffy and Pete Hegseth, they probably believe it too. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=705.04s)]
*  JD Vance, he knows better. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=709.64s)]
*  He knows better and he has signed up for it and he is just going to fucking parrot the line, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=712.72s)]
*  the Trump line and just be the guy that Trump calls up and says, yeah, go ahead and say what I just said. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=717.5600000000001s)]
*  I mean, that was it was a press conference of two reality stars, one cable host and a former CNN pundit all together to lead our government. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=723.6s)]
*  So I wanted to ask you about the Democratic response. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=731.72s)]
*  Pete Buttigieg, for example, he posted a tweet calling Trump's comments despicable, which they were, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=734.72s)]
*  and pointing out that there were zero fatal airline crashes in the four years that he was secretary and then saying, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=740.96s)]
*  quote, President Trump now oversees the military and the FAA. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=745.64s)]
*  One of his first acts was to fire and suspend some of the key personnel who helped keep our skies safe. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=749.28s)]
*  Time for the president to show actual leadership and explain what he will do to prevent this from happening again. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=755.0s)]
*  And of course, I mentioned there were pieces circulating among Trump critics about the gutted Aviation Safety Committee and also how the head of the FAA resigned last week. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=761.0799999999999s)]
*  And this was after, you know, this couple of months ago, Elon Musk went after him on Twitter and said he should resign because the FAA sort of demanded some kind of safety fix to a SpaceX rocket. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=772.1999999999999s)]
*  And Elon was very pissed about that. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=786.3199999999999s)]
*  He thought it was he thought it was regulatory overreach and said that he threatened he was going to sue the FAA. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=788.0799999999999s)]
*  So, you know, that guy's out. So there's no FAA administrator. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=792.56s)]
*  How do you think Democrats should handle all of this? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=795.8s)]
*  I think Pete handled it exactly right, which is we do. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=798.5600000000001s)]
*  Trump wants a big fight about DEI. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=801.92s)]
*  That's the fight he wants to have. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=804.12s)]
*  We don't have to take the bait on that. Right. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=805.6s)]
*  We don't have to get down. We don't have to fight on his chosen territory every time. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=807.12s)]
*  We just have to always remind ourselves that Trump is in charge of everything. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=810.96s)]
*  He owns it all. And he's in this plane crash. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=813.64s)]
*  He's the person responsible for the FAA that was whose air traffic controllers were giving direction to the airplane. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=816.6800000000001s)]
*  He was in charge of the military whose helicopter was involved in the accident. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=822.04s)]
*  He's in charge of the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating it. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=826.08s)]
*  And after the end of this investigation, if they find out that there were insufficient [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=830.0s)]
*  number of air traffic controllers, as is very possible, that the few air traffic controllers we have were deployed incorrectly. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=834.12s)]
*  Donald Trump's the person for fixing that problem. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=841.5600000000001s)]
*  Like he ran promising to fix all of our problems, to put us in a golden age. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=843.9200000000001s)]
*  And he did not do that. And we should hold him accountable for that. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=847.44s)]
*  I'm not saying that voters are going to blame him on his ninth or tenth day for a plane crash that happens on his watch. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=850.72s)]
*  I don't think they would they hold presidents responsible for crashing planes, but they do hold presidents accountable for how they [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=855.5999999999999s)]
*  address the crisis itself and how they solve the problems that led to that crisis. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=862.3599999999999s)]
*  Right. The voters did not blame George W. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=866.68s)]
*  Bush for the hurricane hitting New Orleans. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=869.3199999999999s)]
*  They blamed him for the fact that we weren't prepared for it and now probably responded to it. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=871.56s)]
*  And the way that he is responsible, we have to hold him accountable for what happens from this point forward. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=875.0s)]
*  Also, I think it's it is useful to our point that we've been making, which is like Democrats don't want to just defend [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=880.68s)]
*  institutions, but want to be the part we should be the party of reform. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=888.24s)]
*  Like, have the investigation and whatever reforms need to be made to the FAA, they should be made and we should push for them. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=891.0799999999999s)]
*  And if there are reforms that should have been made under the Biden and Obama administrations, then like, let's find that out. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=899.4s)]
*  You know, and look, every single this was, by the way, a former FAA official sent this message to David [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=905.48s)]
*  Sheppardson at Reuters who covers aviation for Reuters. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=913.72s)]
*  And just so people know, he said every single air traffic controller candidate goes under the same rigorous testing. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=916.7600000000001s)]
*  Very few applicants even make it to the training stage because the process is so difficult. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=922.84s)]
*  And those diversity initiatives that Trump mentioned don't even apply to air traffic controller hiring. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=928.2s)]
*  So that's a former FAA official. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=934.72s)]
*  So that's just complete bullshit from Trump. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=936.24s)]
*  And then, you know, Juliette Cayenne in the Atlantic, she's a former DHS official. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=939.32s)]
*  You know, she pointed out that in 2023, FAA identified 19 serious runway incursions, which is the most in almost a decade. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=943.6800000000001s)]
*  So there's this is not like completely out of the blue. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=950.4000000000001s)]
*  There have been there was a series of close calls over the last couple of years that alarmed a lot of, you know, air safety experts. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=953.84s)]
*  And the causes have been varied. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=961.6400000000001s)]
*  It's either air traffic control staffing shortages, which, by the way, the New York Times reports there was one air traffic controller at DCA the night of the crash when there should have been two. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=963.52s)]
*  Pilot inexperience, demand for air travel, outdated technology. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=974.16s)]
*  And of course, knowing all of this and knowing that DCA is already a very crowded airport and there's also like military flights and training flights like the one that took place the night of the crash that happened. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=977.96s)]
*  The FAA actually added flights to Reagan last year over the objections of a lot of local lawmakers. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=991.8s)]
*  And why do they do that, John? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=997.72s)]
*  Why do you think? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1000.36s)]
*  Well, Congress did it. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1000.88s)]
*  And why do they do it? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1001.8s)]
*  Because they want to land at DCA instead of Dallas when they come in for work. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1002.6s)]
*  But again, it's like, and you know what? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1009.5600000000001s)]
*  So just find out what we need to have safe fucking air travel and do it. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1011.32s)]
*  And it doesn't matter like whose politics that fucks up. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1016.48s)]
*  Just do it. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1019.5600000000001s)]
*  But I will say that in just two weeks, the Trump administration is, you know, we're going to talk about the freezing all spending. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1020.52s)]
*  We're going to cut government. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1027.24s)]
*  Elon Musk is telling people to quit and to take buyouts. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1028.8s)]
*  And if you there's there is waste in government, there is efficiencies to be had. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1032.08s)]
*  There's an abuse. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1037.24s)]
*  There's fraud. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1037.92s)]
*  All that stuff is good, right? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1038.4s)]
*  We should all clean up government. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1039.76s)]
*  We should make it more efficient. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1041.24s)]
*  But they are gutting government and want to gut government so badly that it's going to get to the point where basic government functions that all of us depend on, like air safety, like the FAA, like air traffic control are going to be in jeopardy because these fucking people don't think we need government. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1042.8400000000001s)]
*  They think that government is there for them to get rich and for them to like, you know, do favors for their friends and punish their enemies. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1062.8000000000002s)]
*  And they don't see a real use for government in helping protect the American people. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1069.16s)]
*  I mean, we're going to get to the freeze and the hiring thing in a second. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1074.76s)]
*  But just on this point, there are the shortage of air traffic controllers. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1077.6000000000001s)]
*  You know, it's gonna make it harder to get more air traffic controllers, cutting federal spending, making it higher to hire higher people, and then just shitting on the federal government so much that no one wants to work there.

*  Yes. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1090.28s)]
*  How are you going to get enough people qualified people who can do the job in the pipeline? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1091.0800000000002s)]
*  Because as this FAA official pointed out, it's hard to become an air traffic controller. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1095.16s)]
*  You need people of a certain training and qualifications. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1099.28s)]
*  And so you need a very big funnel to get them in. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1102.2s)]
*  And you're not going to get enough people qualified people do the job if you are making it. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1104.8000000000002s)]
*  You don't have the money to recruit them. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1108.76s)]

*  And you make working in the federal government seem like it sucks. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1110.96s)]
*  Especially if a lot of people who are trained to be air traffic controllers who are in school to be air traffic controllers and the ones who aren't white men, what are they going to why are they going to want to be in the federal government? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1113.68s)]
*  When now anytime that they you know, if they get the job of air traffic controller, the Donald Trump and his administration or potentially future Republican administrations are going to call them DEI hires. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1124.6s)]
*  And if something goes wrong, they're going to get blamed because they're DEI hires. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1133.48s)]

*  I don't think that's a secret. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1291.24s)]
*  And so I had left it. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1292.0s)]
*  I just had left it. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1293.3999999999999s)]
*  I never even invested it. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1294.1599999999999s)]
*  I was just sitting in cash. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1295.16s)]
*  And then the whole economy crashed. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1296.3600000000001s)]

*  So on the day the stock market hit the absolute bottom, I put whatever a few thousand dollars I had put aside into the stock market. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1302.0400000000002s)]

*  So let's talk about the freeze. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1337.88s)]
*  The other big news this week was the completely out of the blue Trump administration memo announcing a freeze on all government grants and loans. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1339.0s)]
*  The memo followed executive orders last week calling for the government to stop spending money on woke projects. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1345.48s)]
*  Not really defined well and it immediately plunged nearly every function of the federal government into complete chaos. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1352.36s)]
*  Democratic and Republican officials all over the country were fielding panicked calls from people in their states who were worried about not being able to access funding for Medicaid. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1358.8799999999999s)]
*  The Medicaid portal was briefly shut down. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1368.24s)]
*  Head start classes free school lunches college financial aid medical research and a lot of other programs at the White House said. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1372.36s)]
*  We're not part of the freeze but somehow we're still temporarily interrupted a bunch of nonprofit groups immediately challenged the memo and a federal judge agreed to put it on hold for six days. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1379.92s)]
*  The White House then rescinded the memo after the judge agreed to put it on hold so they could comply with the judge's order. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1390.24s)]
*  But then White House press secretary Caroline Levitt tweeted that they weren't actually backing down and that the rescinded memo was only intended to avoid confusion with the judge's order. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1395.88s)]
*  Then a second federal judge considering a lawsuit brought by the Democratic attorneys general said of Levitt's post quote I can't cross examine the tweet. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1406.44s)]
*  Not yet not yet but said but said he may need to grant a longer term restraining order because Levitt is making quote a distinction without a difference. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1417.3600000000001s)]
*  We later learned from reporting in the New York Times and the Washington Post that the White House Office of Management and Budget. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1426.48s)]
*  Put out the memo without getting approval from senior officials like White House Chief of Staff Suzy Wiles or even Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller and they were all pretty pissed about the fallout. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1432.44s)]
*  The entire episode gave Democrats a chance to show the fight that they'd been lacking over the last two weeks and let me tell you Dan they were pretty happy with themselves. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1443.76s)]
*  Let's listen to Chuck Schumer. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1453.44s)]
*  People are aroused I haven't seen people so aroused in a very very long time. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1454.8s)]
*  Dan I want to know when when's the last time you can remember being this aroused by a rescinded OMB memo. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1462.0s)]
*  Look John everyone has their thing and I would say that OMB memos have never been my thing but I am also not going to kink shame people I'm not kink shaming anyone especially the Senate minority leader. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1469.96s)]
*  So let's live your life Chuck Schumer whatever floats your boat. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1481.08s)]
*  Wow wow. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1485.72s)]
*  On the process point about how the White House rushed this decision and generally stepped on a rake what happened to the whole this is a professional White House now Suzy Wiles is running it like SEAL Team 6 you know. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1487.6399999999999s)]
*  What what happened I thought we were I thought this was the Trump White House that was finally figuring it all out. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1499.68s)]
*  RIP to all of those beats sweetener pieces written by all those White House reporters about how what an amazing job Suzy Wiles would do now she'd make all the trains run on time. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1505.84s)]
*  Look to be fair here. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1516.24s)]
*  It is true that this version of the Trump White House is better run. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1519.36s)]
*  Oh yeah for sure. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1524.44s)]
*  Than the first version but that doesn't mean it's well run. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1525.08s)]
*  The fact that some minion in the Office of Management and Budget which currently does not have a director can put out a memo. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1529.3999999999999s)]
*  That vaguely shuts down trillions of dollars of federal funding in a moment without running it by anyone is one of the most. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1537.56s)]
*  Evocative examples of incompetence I've ever seen in my life and then the fact that they put this memo out it's not even like this was a bad idea this was like a well executed bad idea. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1548.9599999999998s)]
*  The memo was so vague no one had any idea what it meant it really shut the spigot off and caused mass chaos across the country one memo written by once again. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1559.12s)]
*  And a one be nerd which is what we always call them we work with them and nerd like a nerd deep in the OMB says out this memo shuts down Medicaid funding housing vouchers everything total disaster. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1567.96s)]
*  Then the White House instead of just being like throw the OMB minion under the bus all the fence this Stephen Miller who did not say on off sign off on it went on CNN to defend it. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1578.6s)]
*  And they defended it up until the moment a judge took it away and Trump got upset about the bad press coverage and they rescinded the memo. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1588.16s)]
*  Not only Stephen Miller who like works on the White House but Republican politicians all over the country defended the speaker of the House Glenn Yonkin governor Virginia was like this is the media spreading false missing this is misinformation spread by the media and partisans and all these Democrats are. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1595.2800000000002s)]
*  This is hysteria and blah blah blah and then the White House is like oh yeah we take it back actually. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1612.44s)]
*  But I do think that it is revealing about like the argument that Stephen Miller was making and Russ vote who is going to run the Office of Management and Budget the man who authored project 2025. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1617.64s)]
*  They believe that the president does have the power to control all federal spending and decide who gets what money even though it is the job of Congress according to the Constitution to appropriate money to appropriate funding and. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1631.24s)]
*  Donald Trump and Donald Trump's White House now believe that they have the power of the purse not Congress. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1648.44s)]
*  In contradiction to the Constitution and that they get to just not spend money that they don't agree with that Congress has appropriate so I do think that they are gearing up to eventually challenge. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1654.2s)]
*  The this is known as the impoundment act which just makes clear because it was clear in the Constitution before that but makes clear that presidents may be able to delay spending certain money or they can maybe not spend extra money if they have achieved the goals of the law. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1667.04s)]
*  With the with the money that they already spent but they are not allowed presidents are not allowed to just not spend money because it doesn't comport with their political positions if Congress has passed a law appropriating it. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1682.3999999999999s)]
*  And Stephen Miller and Russ vote don't think that's they just they think that the president is king and gets to do whatever he wants with his power and so it's going to go they're going to eventually challenges and it's going to go to the Supreme Court. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1693.52s)]
*  I mean that's fine they work for the king so maybe that's less surprising right the person who should who is more surprising alarming this is Mike Johnson the speaker of the House. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1702.96s)]
*  The power of the purse is their singular power it is the greatest check and balance they have over the functioning of the executive branch is how they control dictate policy have influence on what happens and Trump is like no and he's like okay more please sir. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1711.44s)]
*  It's just absolutely embarrassing they have all decided except for I don't know maybe three Republican senators at most four and I haven't seen anything from any House members that that Donald Trump. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1725.44s)]
*  Because he was elected he he can do whatever he wants and that their role is just to cheer him on and go on TV I guess. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1739.6000000000001s)]
*  On all their favorite you know regime media channels and talk about how wonderful dear leader is like I don't know why do these people want their jobs. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1748.24s)]
*  Just like go go make money somewhere you probably make more money in the private sector what are you doing you're not making any decisions on your own you're just there to like fluff Donald Trump. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1757.2s)]
*  I mean that's a it's an image you're painting yes it's you know Chuck Schumer it's just chasing your head. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1767.28s)]
*  Yeah he's right you risk out you go unfortunately unfortunately. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1774.72s)]
*  So let's start with the Democrats now that we're back on Chuck Schumer's arousal the the times had a story on Wednesday about how democratic governors got on a call with Schumer. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1778.8s)]
*  To push him and the democratic caucus to do more to oppose Trump and his cabinet nominees more about them in a minute. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1787.9199999999998s)]
*  Because you know things like the spending freeze or pummeling the states but the governors themselves can't really take action to stop it. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1794.0s)]
*  Presumably the details of the call were leaked presumably by the governors or their staff to the New York Times reporter read Epstein. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1802.08s)]
*  What do you make of this piece the blame shifting and just zooming out sort of like the democratic response in general and you know it does appear like the party has found its footing. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1809.92s)]
*  On on their response to the to the OMB spending freeze. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1821.3600000000001s)]
*  Basically I think read Epstein got a window into a lot of the conversations that are happening in the Democratic Party right now there has been. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1825.52s)]
*  Particularly in the first at least the first week of the Trump presidency a tremendous amount of frustration. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1833.6000000000001s)]
*  At elected Democrats more generally but congressional Democrats in particular have acted I have rented I believe on this podcast and in multiple other forums on the Internet about. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1837.92s)]
*  Democrats voting for Trump nominees like to what end like what it like what do you think the upside of that is why would you why would you want to put your name like you really want. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1847.4399999999998s)]
*  To be have endorsed Sean Duffy like is that really what you want is that an ad you're going to run in your race about your bipartisan credentials I did support I did support Sean Duffy no one knows. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1856.3999999999999s)]
*  Or Scott or the hedge fund the billionaire hedge fund manager who's going to help implement the Trump tariffs like is that just like what's the what's the upside right what's the argument for it. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1867.36s)]
*  And just this like some of it is unfair in the sense that there's nothing Chuck Schumer and the Senate Democrats could do to stop any of these appointments from happening. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1876.24s)]
*  No Senate no Senate Democrat voted for Pete Hickseth right he's the no Democrats been the 50th vote for one of these people like that has not happened they've just voted like I don't understand the votes but they've been the 50th vote. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1883.92s)]
*  I mean they have very limited legislative authority to stop stuff but there is this just this frustration that. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1895.28s)]
*  There's just been too much silence and too much equivocation from Democrats and their messaging or it's like. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1901.6s)]
*  We just can't figure out like the right way to talk about Trump because now before it was seemed easy to us because we felt like we had all the political high ground because even if we lost the presidency in 2016. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1906.96s)]
*  We had the majority of voters were anti Trump now the priority voters pick Trump and we and we're just like everything is on one hand. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1917.12s)]
*  We disagree with Trump on the other hand we also agree the border should be secure right it's just there's a lot like all this equivocation. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1926.8799999999999s)]
*  And in the response to the federal funding freeze Democrats did better right they got they got louder they spoke more strongly about the issue of the federal funding freeze. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1933.04s)]
*  Democrats did better right they got they got louder if they spoke more strongly and spoke with one voice now I don't think we should break our arm patting ourselves on the back over it because. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1941.6s)]
*  But there I think there you should get credit they it was better than had been today like and I think if there's a lesson to take from it. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1951.12s)]
*  It is that the things that Democrats were saying about the federal funding freeze was not our. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1958.6399999999999s)]
*  Typical like pay on to institutions that sort of sounds like something on the cutting room floor from Hamilton. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1966.48s)]
*  But instead we just talked about like how people are getting hurt right this program in my district can't get my these people can't pay their rent. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1974.56s)]
*  The this head start program is closed because in parents don't ever take their kids because of this like it's just like very simple granular. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1981.76s)]
*  Real world impacts on real humans and I think there is a lesson in that going forward that with more of that in less of the stem winders about democracy. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=1990.56s)]
*  And just I think a good lesson to is like just say what you feel just go to the mic good get to your favorite platform all the platforms whatever and just say how you feel about this and. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2002.8s)]
*  There was plenty of things I heard Democrats say over the last couple days about it that. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2014.24s)]
*  Were cheesy or maybe cringe I'm not going to criticize any of it because it is more important to get out there and talk quickly. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2018.32s)]
*  And show some emotion show some anger over this on behalf of the people that you represent. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2025.68s)]
*  Not just anger at Trump anger on behalf of people who are getting screwed by Trump. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2031.6s)]
*  I think that's an important distinction and just do it and sometimes it's going to hit sometimes it's not. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2035.84s)]
*  Sometimes you're going to say things that that resonate sometimes you're going to say things that make people cringe it's okay like this is going to be it's going to long for years but I think just getting out there. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2040.64s)]
*  And talking and doing it you always say like everything everywhere all at once like that is better than sitting and waiting and thinking about what how's this going to pull and what should I say and we need a caucus meeting first and we need to just just go out there go out there and talk. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2050.32s)]
*  This is a really important point because I think one thing to help Democrats back as we were waiting for the message we don't know what it is we haven't analyzed all of the results yet we haven't done a bunch of exit polls or focus groups with. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2065.3599999999997s)]
*  First time Trump voters whatever else and just and people are we're flummoxed. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2076.64s)]
*  We're all going to fucking die waiting for the catalyst results. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2080.16s)]
*  I mean they're supposed to come in like six weeks so I hope not. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2083.2s)]
*  But the election shook Democrats to the core like what we thought worked. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2088.7999999999997s)]
*  Did not work in any way shape or form and blow up in our face and so they're waiting for the right thing to say but if there is one lesson of the Trump era. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2094.0s)]
*  Is that volume in frequency is much more important than precision when it comes to messaging. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2102.4s)]
*  You just get out there and start talking by the way because that's the game he's playing it is just it just talk all the time because if you're talking all the time. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2110.0800000000004s)]
*  The creates the increases the number of chances that someone watch you hear what you're saying and if you happen to fuck up and say the wrong thing. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2118.7999999999997s)]
*  If you're out there five minutes later you're going to pay less or price for this is one of the things that really hurt Kamala Harris was she was out there so much less than Trump so when she did make a mistake. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2127.7599999999998s)]
*  Like she did on the view it haunted her ways Trump was out there saying crazy shit on a podcast three times a day but because he was doing it there was always a one a new thing coming after it there was less political consequences for doing it same problem with Biden over the last four years. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2138.0s)]
*  I mean let's not like I know every six months like right right but yeah no it is a volume game and just someone. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2152.4s)]
*  Added this up but apparently like in Trump's first term in his first week he was in front of the press or in front of cameras. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2160.8s)]
*  Speaking for like four hours the first week Biden in his first week was a little less maybe like three hours or something this the first week of Trump's second term it was like eight hours. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2168.8s)]
*  He was in front of camera I mean even he did that fucking awful press conference about the plane crash this morning Thursday morning and he did like another press avail as he was signing the more executive orders blaming Biden and Obama for the plane crash later in the day and he was taking more questions. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2180.7200000000003s)]
*  For even as nuts as Trump was in twenty seventeen that he was still abiding sort of by a. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2196.56s)]
*  What is now an anachronistic model of political communications we try to stage manage stuff right we're gonna like this is the story of the day we. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2204.44s)]
*  If we do X we can't do Y later because it'll ruin our headlines about our EOS it's like nope. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2211.7599999999998s)]
*  Just do it all it's always happening it's never ending there is no new cycle and Democrats could learn some lessons that like we obviously have a huge megaphone. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2218.84s)]
*  Disparity here like we don't have we have a very small handful politicians can get real attention it's great if we can all speak with one voice because that will help about one thing but. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2226.6800000000003s)]
*  That's not gonna happen every time so just get out there yeah so the spending freeze fiasco has done little to slow Trump down. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2236.32s)]
*  Keep signing orders and memos targeting immigrants government workers trans kids educators parents just about everyone in the past few days he's issued the following executive orders that will. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2243.32s)]
*  Deny federal funding for schools that teach kids about racism and discrimination. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2255.36s)]
*  Penalized schools that don't teach content that is patriotic enough I guess Trump gets to define what that means an executive order that will deport. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2260.96s)]
*  International students who protested the war in Gaza will revoke their visas. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2271.04s)]
*  ban gender affirming care for trans children and send 10s of thousands of undocumented immigrants to detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2276.6s)]
*  The White House also sent a mass email offering more than 2 million federal employees a buyout if they just reply to the email and write the word resign. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2288.64s)]
*  Resign. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2300.4s)]
*  We're gonna talk about the email in a second but on the executive orders which one of these seems real which of them seem like bullshit. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2303.36s)]
*  Most of them are bullshit in the traditional sense of actually have a the president having the authority to implement what he said he is going to do. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2311.6400000000003s)]
*  Right across the board does not just once you mentioned here across the board most of these. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2322.04s)]
*  Executive orders are there even really executive orders they're really presidential memorandums are just their missives right they are press releases with signatures. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2326.96s)]
*  He doesn't have the authority to do the things he's saying there's a legal precedent for him from somewhere very clearly in violation of the constitution. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2333.6s)]
*  Well, I mean, hopefully be struck down, but who knows, but they just there there is not a ton of actual legal power in it, but I think that really undersells the danger here. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2342.36s)]
*  Right so let's take the example of the the ones in education, trying to deal with you know quote unquote critical race theory or forcing patriotic education. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2352.44s)]
*  The federal government has almost no role in what local schools teach the even if they were to use federal funding to try to put those put policies in place that's very limited 90% of school funding comes from state and local communities. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2361.44s)]
*  If in even in the states where they have actually passed laws putting some of the stuff in a place. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2380.08s)]
*  There are like studies have shown that they've had very little impact on what I mean so many cases are have not been as impactful as the conservative legislators would think because teachers still you know there's not someone in the school telling teachers what to do, but. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2384.96s)]
*  There there is a chilling effect of these sternly worded but very vague missives declaring that things are now illegal or not allowed or if you do them there will be retribution right like, for example. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2398.2s)]
*  Michigan State University this week canceled their lunar new year celebration because they thought it according to reporting from this in the Lansing journal that it might violate DEI policy anti DEI policies. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2411.12s)]
*  Right it's because they're confused they don't know that here's this thing we have no idea what it actually means are we going to get ourselves in trouble are we going to face political blowback. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2426.8399999999997s)]
*  Could we that could be a big fight over this could you know there be retribution from the government and even if you like the. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2435.52s)]
*  I'm sure that if the general counsel of the university looked at it and was like obviously we would win this fight you don't want the fight you can't afford the fight you don't financially time wise and so. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2443.04s)]
*  You're going to see people making a lot of decisions to avoid getting on the wrong side of Trump on some of these things and I think about here in. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2454.2799999999997s)]
*  California like up where I live the public schools every fall do Ruby bridges day to celebrate the. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2463.04s)]
*  Ruby bridges and the D and talk and to teach about desegregation about segregation and desegregating the schools and. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2469.52s)]
*  Everyone is if you can is to walk to school that day like Ruby bridges did like I don't think this would happen here, but you can see in another part of the country. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2474.2799999999997s)]
*  People wondering whether that that was too woke to have right is our black is black history month can be too woke people going to trim some of that stuff back because they're worried about violating angering. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2481.96s)]
*  A federal government even the federal government has no statutory authority to enforce these policies on you. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2492.8s)]
*  Yeah, and it just another example that just popped up that I think is even more consequential, which is the the EO on banning gender affirming care for children again. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2499.1600000000003s)]
*  The that is not something that you can do by executive order i'm fairly certain, though I do not have a legal degree. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2512.2000000000003s)]
*  But a children's hospital and health care provider in Richmond just said that they have suspended all gender affirming care. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2519.6800000000003s)]
*  For those under 19 years old, because they feel like they have gotten very specific guidance on this from the state, I assume that means that a lot of these Republican governors. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2528.6400000000003s)]
*  Who like Trump like Glen Young can in Virginia probably see the the federal EO match it with a state EO now what's ultimately going to happen with gender affirming care for children. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2539.44s)]
*  it's a case at the Supreme Court right now so it's gonna be decided there I don't I don't have a lot of hope about how that's going to turn out also Congress with the Republican Congress i'm sure they're going to try to. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2550.5600000000004s)]
*  include there's been some reporting that they might include like a hide like amendment. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2562.1600000000003s)]
*  In the budget bill that sort of you know threatens to cut off all federal aid to hospitals and healthcare providers that provide gender affirming care. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2567.2000000000003s)]
*  Like they currently do for hospitals that provide abortions that's the height amendment. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2575.7200000000003s)]
*  So I don't think that like I don't think that's the last word here but you're right that the chilling effect is there's going to be. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2580.7599999999998s)]
*  there's going to be schools and hospitals and organizations all across the country and red states and and maybe in some blue states or red areas of blue states that just take these seriously because it's a fucking executive order from the federal government. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2587.04s)]
*  On Guantanamo. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2602.96s)]
*  Are we really going to build a 30,000 person detention facility in Guantanamo Bay just for context the Cook County jail in Chicago is one of the largest single site facilities in the country. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2604.08s)]
*  And it has an average daily population of 9000 we're going to build a 30,000 person detention facility. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2615.04s)]
*  That who's going to run and we're just going to send what we're just going to send undocumented immigrants that don't know where where they're from where they came from we're just going to put them in a detention Center for what indefinitely like what. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2621.72s)]
*  The fuck we would hold migrants in one of the most notorious prisons in the world right something that has been at Guantanamo Bay has been a recruiting. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2634.08s)]
*  tool for terrorists for 20 years now and I assume would be run by the military because Guantanamo is a military base, so you would have. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2645.8399999999997s)]
*  A military run prison camp for migrants who came to America, I know Tom home and said this is the worst of the worst which. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2653.92s)]
*  Which, by the way, they you know they've been saying that we thought it was going to be bullshit is bullshit, I think the the rate for. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2661.36s)]
*  How many undocumented immigrants have been rounded up and deported with. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2668.3199999999997s)]
*  criminal records versus undocumented immigrants who the only law they broke was illegally crossing in the first place is like like Joe Biden had a higher percentage of deportations that were actually. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2673.48s)]
*  immigrants with criminal records than trump has in his first week already so it's just the whole thing was bullshit they're not just going after. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2685.8s)]
*  undocumented immigrants with criminal records they're going after every undocumented immigrant that they find it, I mean, this is something that Tommy and Ben can talk about much better than I could at least is. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2693.16s)]
*  It was not like the US reputations like doing fucking great right now, but I mean with down terms, our President, both what is you know our role and what is happening Gaza has been deeply damaging to our reputation around the world. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2704.08s)]
*  But the idea that we're going to house migrants in a prison camp is no like a one of the like I said a notorious prison camp is going to be deeply deeply damaging to our reputation around the world. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2715.64s)]
*  Also, this just like happened this week in a speech that dumb trump gave and no one paid a lot of attention to it. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2728.0s)]
*  But in the as he was asked after he finished his whole anti immigrant thing he was like and then there's some people. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2733.28s)]
*  And maybe they didn't come here illegally, but they're just they're just you know criminals in this country America there's criminals and they're here and they're really bad criminals and you know what. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2738.52s)]
*  I think we're going to get approval to just deport them we're going to we're going to send them to some other foreign countries and i'm like you're going to send. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2747.88s)]
*  American citizens who are convicted of crimes to fear and deport them to foreign countries like are we going to send now we're going to like when is the line that he's going to start trying to send Americans to Guantanamo Bay American citizens to Guantanamo Bay like what. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2754.76s)]
*  There any particular American citizens that you were been worried about over the recent years of being sent to Guantanamo Bay. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2769.36s)]
*  I mean. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2775.44s)]
*  It's been alright, I mean this for the thing is it has been a running joke for nearly a decade among about us about being sent to Guantanamo about various people who have been a Trump has been sent to Guantanamo and. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2776.56s)]
*  They're building now is it be interesting like you would feel like you're going to need money to build a lot of money to build the largest prison. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2787.2400000000002s)]
*  Under American control at a military base. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2794.92s)]
*  I presume you probably have to appropriate money for that maybe they can find it in the couch cushions the way they found money for the wall, but there would be there will likely be a big congressional debate about this. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2798.2799999999997s)]
*  A big congressional debate the courts will have a role as well, and look I think that the scary moment here is what happens when the Supreme Court if the Supreme Court. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2808.2s)]
*  You know hands down a decision that Trump is opposed to and what Trump does and you know so far they you know the White House complied with the. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2820.0s)]
*  Federal judge that blocked their spending freeze and you know I guess it was kind of a fuck up in OMB anyway so whatever they were fine with it, but you know it's a very conservative court and a lot of times they give Trump exactly what he wants, but they hand down a decision that he opposes and then he says. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2829.44s)]
*  Not going to listen to the court you know JD Vance was on a fucking podcast a couple years ago it said they told you said oh my advice for Trump in a second term would be to fire everyone in the federal government and replace them with all your people and when John Roberts tells you you can't do it you say. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2846.2799999999997s)]
*  You and what army and JD Vance is on on the record saying that so like what happens that that's the real constitutional crisis that's when that's when people start going to Guantanamo so that's something to watch for coming attractions in. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2859.16s)]
*  Cool cool listen with the buyout the email had the subject line fork in the road which was. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2871.56s)]
*  Exactly what the email that Elon Musk sent to Twitter employees had said fork in the road. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2877.36s)]
*  Right after he took over the company do you have a sense of whether this move is serious whether the federal government is authorized to spend money on on a buyout for federal employees who decide not to come back to the federal government to work. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2882.96s)]
*  I have no idea whether they are technically authorized to do it but I imagine this is quite serious right this is as you point out this is exactly what Elon Musk. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2895.72s)]
*  Did at Twitter he has installed some of his closest allies people who helped him with all of the layoffs at Twitter at the office of personnel management which is an obscure but incredibly powerful agency which staffs the government. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2904.56s)]
*  I imagine that there probably is some sort of authority that allows you to because these people are choosing. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2917.32s)]
*  They by doing this they were not firing them right this is a way to get around civil service protections right you're not firing them you are giving them the opportunity to. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2922.32s)]
*  Leave now Judd Legum in his newsletter of popular information is pointed out he's read the actual missive that the OPM posted on their website and it's not actually a buyout. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2931.44s)]
*  For the next nine months and you stop working tomorrow. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2941.48s)]
*  What they are saying is basically you leave in September and made your job duties will change but you're not free of working. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2945.24s)]
*  You might still work like it there's a lot of gray area into what would happen you'd be free of some in person responsibilities but it is incorrect in Judd's view and it's not a good thing to do. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2953.7999999999997s)]
*  This is a buyout it's actually just a way to get people to forcible resignation or encourage resignation. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2965.32s)]
*  Well there's also video uncovered of Russ vote again project 2025 guy who's going to be the director who basically said we want to make working in the federal government as traumatic as possible for bureaucrats that we want to get rid of so that this is and clearly that's what they've been trying to do the last couple weeks. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2971.8s)]
*  And I think it is just the reason why we should take this very seriously regardless of what their the specific. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2989.04s)]
*  Powers they may have is this is the full conservative project of decades now which is to how about the federal government so we can do less stuff then on the things that continues to do it does them less well which makes the public. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=2996.24s)]
*  More dissatisfied with government which causes them to elect more anti government politicians who then how about the government some more rinse repeat in the end goal of this right is not just. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3008.84s)]
*  Though that you the government's doing less in health care and education is what these hardcore conservatives who are not just trump types this is like this is these are Paul Ryan people. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3019.76s)]
*  Is they're going after social security and Medicare when they do not want is the federal government to be giving people. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3028.08s)]
*  Health care and retirement security and the only in those are sacrosanct programs Trump voters love them the only way you ever get to be able to take those down is to reduce people's faith in government to such an extent that they're not going to be able to do that. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3035.2799999999997s)]
*  Health care and retirement security and the only in those are sacrosanct programs Trump voters love them the only way you ever get to be able to take those down is to reduce people's faith in government to such an extent that they're unwilling to trust it with their health care and the retirement security and so this is this is what this project is. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3046.84s)]
*  Yeah and and and social security and Medicare probably come at the end you know. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3063.84s)]
*  Yeah that's the last thing you get you make you make it so that everything else is hated they can do nothing else well that people are willing to say put my retirement in the stock market right or awful or privatize my Medicare to insurance companies. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3067.68s)]
*  And by the way I think this is part of the reason that they walked back the the spending freeze because it caused the kind of uproar around the country that they know is unpopular and they want to cut government cut all those programs and benefits in a much sneakier quieter way. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3081.64s)]
*  Then what happened with like an all out spending freeze that freaked everybody out so it is it's something to watch. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3099.48s)]

*  So basically these two days boil down to Democrats trying to paint Kennedy as anti-vax and also unqualified. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3428.68s)]
*  Which he is. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3436.64s)]
*  Kennedy's trying to say no not anti-vax. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3437.8s)]
*  I never was. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3440.88s)]
*  I'm being misconstrued. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3441.64s)]
*  Who do you think came out on top and are we getting a we're getting a vaccines optional HHS secretary. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3444.44s)]
*  That seems like I mean if we just got a Fox weekend host as our Secretary of Defense and everything's on the table here. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3449.64s)]
*  I don't know I don't know what's going to happen here. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3459.52s)]
*  I think there is one yes Democrats focus a lot on vaccines that is the most that is. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3461.0s)]
*  RFK juniors Achilles heel politically with the public like that's the that is the part of him that they are most skeptical of that they do not like. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3466.96s)]
*  But I thought some of the smartest questioning came from Michael Bennett in the first day on the finance committee Michael Bennett the senator from Colorado. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3474.68s)]
*  He did a he did this the right way he went he did a lightning round basically with RFK junior where he asked him he read him quotes and he read him in context and said. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3481.92s)]
*  Did you say this or did you not say this and it was some of the things we've heard about vaccines about various conspiracy theories. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3493.08s)]
*  But the last one he asked was basically do you believe a a pro abortion access comment of his and the reason why that was smart is that's how you defeat RFK juniors you have to get some of the only way to actually defeat him. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3498.52s)]
*  There are ways to score political points with the public but you actually defeat him you need to get a Republican you need to get four Republicans to vote against them. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3510.48s)]
*  And and one area of concern and this is a weird thing to say Mike Pence's political organization is running ads attacking RF trying to get Republicans to oppose RFK junior because he has been. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3518.3599999999997s)]
*  In favor of abortion access prior to becoming Trump's buddy here and so like that's a way that that is a smart way to do it was he was going to confirmed. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3529.7999999999997s)]
*  Probably but I thought that was that at least showed a savvy way to try to actually get some Republican votes or make it more uncomfortable for Republicans to do it with their constituents which is going to matter more than making them uncomfortable than just getting more Democrats who are already opposed and riled up. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3540.0s)]
*  Well I thought some bad news on that front was he basically said that he would look at the safety of Miffy Pristone. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3554.6s)]
*  The abortion pill and so that's on the table and then after the hearings the Susan B Anthony group which is an anti abortion group said that they now favor RFK junior because they think he's going to help them pull Miffy Pristone off the market and ban the abortion pill. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3564.0s)]
*  So that is pretty pretty frightening. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3579.64s)]
*  It's not good if he gets confirmed I was trying to find a bright spot for Democrats trying to keep him from getting confirmed. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3582.92s)]
*  My only bright spot will see what happens is Bill Cassidy the senator from Louisiana Republican Senator from Louisiana who's a doctor and who voted to impeach Trump. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3587.7599999999998s)]
*  Add some really tough questioning about RFK juniors anti vaccine stances and positions and what he said and basically ended the hearing leaving it up in the air whether or not he was going to vote for him. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3597.16s)]
*  I mean he's theoretically potentially the fourth because we know there's three possibles and Mikulski Collins and McConnell although not that I have any evidence that. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3610.3199999999997s)]
*  I know that's the thing is like also you could see Cassidy be a no but then like maybe McConnell doesn't vote no on this one right. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3618.48s)]
*  So it's like it's tough to figure out. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3624.16s)]
*  It's not like those are automatic nodes at all you know so but I guess Cassidy would be the hope there. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3625.8399999999997s)]
*  We're not going to subject you to separate sections on Tulsi Gabbard and Cash Patel. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3631.96s)]
*  Reminder here if you need them Gabbard is an Assad and Putin sympathizer with no intelligence experience and Patel is a Trump adoring hatchet man with no FBI experience. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3636.68s)]
*  Both hearings were pretty tense. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3646.3999999999996s)]
*  Let's take a listen. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3648.24s)]
*  Scabbert is simple yes or no question. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3649.2s)]
*  Do you still think Edward Snowden is brave. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3650.8399999999997s)]
*  Mr. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3654.2s)]
*  Vice chairman Edward Snowden broke the law. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3654.52s)]
*  I do not agree with or support with all of the information and intelligence that he released nor the way in which he did it. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3658.16s)]
*  My understanding is that the performers on this J six choir were the rioters who are in prison. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3664.84s)]
*  I'm not aware of that sir I didn't have anything to do with the recording. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3671.24s)]
*  You weren't aware of who made the recording. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3675.04s)]
*  No center. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3677.84s)]
*  Your boss said that General Milley who served us with great distinction I happen to have great admiration for should be tried for treason. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3678.52s)]
*  You agree with that. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3687.04s)]
*  Senator everybody's entitled to their opinion. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3688.0s)]
*  Who put away the Unabomber. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3690.48s)]
*  The FBI. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3692.52s)]
*  Who put away Tim Timothy McVeigh and his. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3693.48s)]
*  His Stalin's stomach for blood. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3697.72s)]
*  Break agents at the FBI. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3700.92s)]
*  Who helped investigate Jesse Smollett. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3702.6s)]
*  What. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3705.64s)]
*  Who. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3706.6s)]
*  How did he get in there. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3707.52s)]
*  An effort of self aggrandizement set back the fight for minority rights for years. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3708.52s)]
*  I think that was local authorities. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3715.36s)]
*  Because the FBI had opened an investigation wasn't it. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3717.48s)]
*  Wow I hadn't heard that. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3720.92s)]
*  That was quite the turn that I was not expecting. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3722.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3725.0s)]
*  What was the point he was trying to make up even up into that point. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3725.88s)]
*  I guess that the FBI is great. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3729.04s)]
*  I mean sure sure I don't know. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3732.16s)]
*  So cash Patel has just decided like. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3735.44s)]
*  The old cash Patel is just got he's gone. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3738.8s)]
*  There's I don't know what you're talking about I don't know this guy. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3741.88s)]
*  I didn't go on this podcast with all these white nationalist racists. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3744.7200000000003s)]
*  With Nazi sympathizing views didn't do any of that. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3749.44s)]
*  Never heard of that person Jan six choir I don't know what you're talking about. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3753.48s)]
*  He also he broke with Trump on the January 6 pardons for the violent offenders the people who were there for. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3757.24s)]
*  I just disagree with that and he was very much like you know no retribution not going to be looking backwards. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3762.4s)]
*  So that's cash Patel I guess he's I guess he's getting through. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3769.3599999999997s)]
*  It seems that way he I mean all the reporting has been he has really a swing of the. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3772.72s)]
*  A lot of the very obvious concerns about him with Republicans by just by just lying and just pretending yes or just saying like I was just I was just saying some crazy shit on podcast which I guess I guess if if we're ever confirmed we can say that too. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3777.6s)]
*  Where there's not a chance that either of us are ever seeking play let me just play something you responded to from John love it that was fairly. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3789.12s)]
*  Oh no not the Pundits 2018 no. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3797.52s)]
*  2018 no. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3800.2s)]
*  Be like I don't know any of those people I don't know what you're talking about the San Francisco live show. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3802.04s)]
*  Fuck sounds like my voice not my voice. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3806.7599999999998s)]
*  With the people mix our voices up all the time so you just say that was Tommy. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3810.16s)]
*  Yes so cash Patel FBI great. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3813.3999999999996s)]
*  Seems seems like that's happening. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3815.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean the fact that one of like whenever you're doing the list of people who are possible no votes Tom Tillis would be on that list because he is a senator who has to run for reelection has been. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3817.12s)]
*  Has had moments of sanity in his brief career but he introduced cash Patel so it seems like it seems like we're not going to get him. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3826.3999999999996s)]
*  And then I guess Tulsi Gabbard then is the one who's in most jeopardy. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3833.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah because she wasn't mean enough to Edward Snowden. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3838.68s)]
*  Actually John you know the most fucked up thing is is the person in the most jeopardy may actually be. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3843.52s)]
*  Though his nominee for Secretary of Labor because she wants endorsed the proact. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3850.12s)]
*  Oh God she's actually not even like OK enough for Trump like she's actually a decent like a like any Republican president who nominated her Democrats would be like wow that's pretty cool. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3853.8799999999997s)]
*  On one specific issue. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3864.08s)]
*  She's pretty pro labor as the next labor. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3867.4s)]
*  Yes there are a lot of Democrats who didn't endorse the proact. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3869.7999999999997s)]
*  So right. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3871.8799999999997s)]
*  Exactly exactly. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3872.8399999999997s)]
*  So she's in the most danger. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3874.32s)]
*  It was I'm not entirely sure the strategy of focusing most of our ire on Tulsi Gabbard on the Edward Snowden trader thing. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3875.32s)]
*  I don't. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3883.44s)]
*  What. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3884.0s)]
*  I don't get that either. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3885.44s)]
*  I don't get that either. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3886.6400000000003s)]
*  She has plenty plenty plenty of targets there for Tulsi Gabbard. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3887.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean that's obviously it's the Intel committee. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3891.1200000000003s)]
*  They this is like they're they're very closely aligned with the Intel community. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3893.0s)]
*  And I mean I obviously have very strong feelings about what Edward Snowden did to them. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3898.48s)]
*  But it's just from a public perspective or even trying to peel off Republicans. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3902.32s)]
*  It seems like I'd be curious to know what the reasoning was because there were smart people who were making that case. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3906.32s)]
*  I was surprised by it. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3912.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3913.6800000000003s)]
*  So well and those are all the most controversial picks. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3914.04s)]
*  I think Pam Bondi is also getting through which is fucking crazy. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3917.6000000000004s)]
*  She did. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3919.92s)]
*  She made it through committee on party line vote. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3920.2400000000002s)]
*  Last week. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3922.76s)]
*  So well we'll see. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3923.1600000000003s)]
*  We'll see if any of these see if we can take down the pro labor labor secretary. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3924.32s)]
*  One last thing before we go. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3928.7200000000003s)]
*  So right before this recording I interviewed Chris Murphy Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut for offline which will be out this Sunday. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3930.32s)]
*  It's a great interview. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3936.84s)]
*  He won't he wanted to talk about big tech and regulation. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3937.92s)]
*  He's been talking a lot about social media and loneliness and all the all the topics we love discussing on offline. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3940.52s)]
*  But because I had him for the interview I at the top I asked him all about these last two weeks and how they were responding and how Democrats were responding. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3947.04s)]
*  He's someone who has not been afraid to be out there being very forceful sounding the alarm. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3954.04s)]
*  And so I asked him about all that and I thought his answers were interesting enough that wanted to play it here on Pods of America as a preview of Sunday's offline episode. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3960.84s)]
*  So you'll be hearing that right now. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3970.6s)]
*  Do you think some of the reticence about speaking up has to do with the fact that some of your colleagues are just personally afraid. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3972.76s)]
*  Like do you sense any fear among your either your Democratic colleagues or even the Republican colleagues. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3980.76s)]
*  Listen that is not a conversation that we have out loud but I don't know how what has happened in the last week doesn't have an impact. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3986.1600000000003s)]
*  I haven't shared this yet but it is just true. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3995.96s)]
*  My office has received phone calls and threats that are different than anything we had received prior to the pardoning of the January 6 protesters. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=3999.0s)]
*  We have had to have very different conversations internally about how we protect me my family and my staff. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=4010.76s)]
*  I assume other offices are getting those calls. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=4017.08s)]
*  I assume those calls are reaching other Democratic activists who speak up online all around the country. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=4020.08s)]
*  And whether or not that reaches the level of consciousness. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=4026.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=4030.36s)]
*  But when your family is threatened with harm of course it may at the very least subconsciously depress your interest in fighting as hard as you can. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=4031.44s)]
*  Given the fact that Elon Musk can can sort of rouse those people with one or two or three tweets. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=4044.56s)]
*  It probably also has to do with why there hasn't been a concentrated effort to take him on personally because folks don't want to end up as I have been and many others on the receiving end of sort of his social media storms because what comes with that is an implicit threat of violence. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=4051.52s)]
*  Those threats do not seem to have slowed you down. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=4068.3999999999996s)]
*  How are you personally sort of handling that. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=4072.6800000000003s)]
*  Well I just feel like I have a unique responsibility. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=4076.36s)]
*  I mean I'm one of 47 Democratic senators. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=4079.6400000000003s)]
*  I I'm going to take some precautions to make sure that me and my family and my staff are protected. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=4083.04s)]
*  But if if I mute my voice you know then all is lost. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=4089.72s)]
*  And yes I don't completely understand why everybody isn't fighting as hard as you know as some of us have been. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=4096.08s)]
*  So I feel like my role right now is to model a kind of vigorous organic authentic anger at what is happening to hopefully inspire others to join. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=4105.2s)]
*  Good for Chris Murphy. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=4117.28s)]
*  Huh. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=4118.28s)]
*  Yeah Chris Murphy is great. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=4118.84s)]
*  First of all terrifying that that's happening that he's getting those threats and that other people are and then people are scared now of speaking out. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=4120.08s)]
*  But I'm glad he's out there and I'm glad he's not backing down. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=4127.76s)]
*  So all right. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=4131.84s)]
*  That is our show for today. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=4133.2s)]
*  Everyone have a great weekend because because the news is so wonderful and we'll be we'll be back in your feeds with a new show on Tuesday. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=4135.44s)]
*  Bye everyone. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-IU6IhH-o&t=4145.96s)]
