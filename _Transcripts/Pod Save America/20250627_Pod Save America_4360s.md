Video Description: As New York City celebrates Zohran Mamdani's primary win, MAGA, Wall Street, a handful of Democrats succumb to socialist paranoia. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth lashes out at the press after CNN reports that last weekend's airstrikes barely set back Iran's nuclear program. President Trump pressures Congress to pass his Big Bullshit Bill by July 4th, despite a new ruling from the Senate Parliamentarian that could sink it altogether. Jon and Dan react to Senator Mitch McConnell's claim that "people back home" will "get over" Medicaid cuts, the administration's desperate attempt to make their Iran strikes look like a success, and offer Zohran-skeptical Democrats some honest advice about what their voters want. Then, Jon talks to Congressman Robert Garcia, the new top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, about investigating ICE and why he thinks Stephen Miller is the "biggest piece of shit in the country."

# Trump RAGES Over Leaked Report EXPOSING His Lies
**Pod Save America:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A)
*  So Trump had a big event on the White House on Thursday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=0.0s)]
*  The point was to sell his big bill of bullsh**. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3.24s)]
*  Look at you with your new BBBBB. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=7.24s)]
*  Honestly, I just found myself saying it. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=9.84s)]
*  I hate saying it, as I said earlier today in our meeting. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=13.44s)]
*  And so bullsh** was just the easiest thing to come out of my mouth just then. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=15.84s)]
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Jon Favreau. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=18.96s)]
*  I'm Dan Pfeiffer. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=20.96s)]
*  On today's show, we're going to talk about the Republican plan to gut people's health care, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=21.96s)]
*  which is running into some roadblocks. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=24.96s)]
*  We'll cover the absolute meltdown over Zoran Mamdani's big win in New York City on Tuesday. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=26.72s)]
*  And then later I chat with California Congressman Robert Garcia about his big win in the race to be the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=32.36s)]
*  what fights he plans to pick and what he really thinks about Stephen Miller, your friend and mine. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=38.72s)]
*  But let's start with the military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities that Donald Trump wants us to believe was the most perfect, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=45.32s)]
*  successful operation in the history of the United States. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=52.8s)]
*  Eat s**t, D-Day. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=56.8s)]
*  This is it. This is the most perfect strike you've ever seen. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=60.08s)]
*  Can I give you some D-Day numbers? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=64.24s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=65.56s)]
*  While we're here, just to put this in perspective and not to demean this very excellent strike that happened. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=66.6s)]
*  But there were 5000 ships in D-Day, 13000 planes, 156000 troops and 600000 pounds of equipment removed on that day. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=71.68s)]
*  OK, I think you've I think you've wandered into the wrong podcast. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=82.28s)]
*  The Podcast Save the World records on Tuesday. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  Look, I don't know what podcast I'm on. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  I thought it was a fact based podcast that wanted to push back against misinformation from the Trump administration. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=91.92s)]
*  So the president started crashing out about this when CNN broke the news earlier this week that the Defense Department's initial intelligence assessment [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=97.68s)]
*  found that the strike only set back around nuclear program by a few months, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=107.44000000000001s)]
*  that their stockpile of enriched uranium was not destroyed and that their centrifuges are largely intact. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  Trump responded by rage posting 21 times on Wednesday while he was at the NATO summit, I guess in Europe. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=118.28s)]
*  He also responded by attacking CNN's Natasha Bertrand for breaking the story. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=125.44s)]
*  He has ordered an FBI leak investigation. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=130.44s)]
*  He's limiting access to classified information for Congress. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=133.52s)]
*  And the White House has orchestrated an aggressive PR campaign where Trump officials in the White House and the cabinet are now saying that actually, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=137.64000000000001s)]
*  the intelligence says that the nuclear program was obliterated, that the centrifuges were destroyed. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=148.44s)]
*  The enriched uranium wasn't moved. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=153.8s)]
*  The program was set back years and anyone who says otherwise is basically a lying traitor who hates the troops. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=155.68s)]
*  Let's listen to Pete Hegseth's early morning presser from today. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=162.8s)]
*  Are you certain none of that highly enriched uranium was moved? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=166.4s)]
*  Of course, we're watching every single aspect. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=169.56s)]
*  But, Jennifer, you've been about the worst, the one who misrepresents the most intentionally. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  How many stories have been written about how hard it is to, I don't know, fly a plane for 36 hours? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=177.52s)]
*  Has MSNBC done that story? Has Fox? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=183.95999999999998s)]
*  Have we done the story how hard that is? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=187.16s)]
*  Have we done it two or three times? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=189.23999999999998s)]
*  Because you cheer against Trump so hard. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  It's like in your DNA and in your blood to cheer against Trump. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=194.64s)]
*  I haven't heard Pete that mad since he missed last call. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=198.04s)]
*  No? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=200.51999999999998s)]
*  That's pretty good. I like it. I laughed. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=203.67999999999998s)]
*  He was talking there to Jennifer Griffin of Fox News, his former home where he was the weekend anchor on Fox and Friends, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  for just asking a very legitimate question. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  What did you think about Hegseth? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=217.23999999999998s)]
*  What do you think about this whole freakout that the Trump administration and the president are having over the aftermath of the strikes? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=219.28s)]
*  In the event that Hegseth had with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was pitiful. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=230.12s)]
*  Like they made everyone go to the Pentagon at 8 a.m. for this press conference at no point. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=236.0s)]
*  This is a press conference that was touted by the president of the United States on one of the many truths he sent while sitting in a NATO summit. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=241.4s)]
*  And yet they didn't talk at all about the damage assessments, right? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=247.8s)]
*  As General Cain said, the military doesn't grade their own homework. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=251.36s)]
*  So all they did, they didn't push back on the thing. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=255.48000000000002s)]
*  They did not talk about the actual results or success of the mission. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  They detailed the tremendous difficulty it takes to fly those planes, to successfully launch the missiles or to drop the bombs, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=262.12s)]
*  whether they're supposed to be dropped at all of that, but doesn't get at the question everyone had, which is what next for Iran's nuclear program? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=271.2s)]
*  Where is the highly enriched uranium? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=278.88s)]
*  Like you played that point. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=280.76s)]
*  He was asked the question of where it was. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=281.68s)]
*  He didn't answer that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=283.88s)]
*  They don't know. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=284.88s)]
*  And that's the big thing. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=286.0s)]
*  It is very pitiful. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=286.92s)]
*  And it is how we've seen this. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=288.03999999999996s)]
*  It's the intellectual Zamboni to use Levitt's phrase of Trump goes out before there's a single battlefield damage assessment and says, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=291.08s)]
*  we obliterated the whole thing. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  And now it turns out that's not the case. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=300.28s)]
*  And the entire government intelligence apparatus has to run behind Trump and try to make that true, even though it's obviously not true. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=301.88s)]
*  There was one excellent explanation for why they're spinning this so hard from a surprising source. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=309.0s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=313.84s)]
*  When you have a totalitarian regime, you have to save face. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=314.44s)]
*  That was Caroline Levitt from today's briefing. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=322.71999999999997s)]
*  She kept up the party line. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=325.4s)]
*  It's the most successful operation ever. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=328.16s)]
*  The president has now also threatened to sue the New York Times, which confirmed CNN's reporting. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=331.0s)]
*  He's gone after Natasha Bertrand of CNN personally, directly. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=336.56s)]
*  They're all going after her. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=341.24s)]
*  So did Caroline Levitt going after the New York Times. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=343.12s)]
*  The New York Times, I was proud to see that they put out a statement that said there will be no apology. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=345.64s)]
*  There will be no retraction. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=351.68s)]
*  There will be nothing. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=353.16s)]
*  We reported the truth the best we could. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=354.6s)]
*  But it's the whole thing is so bizarre because at no point are they saying that this report does not exist or that the way it was characterized is wrong. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=356.48s)]
*  Which well, and you know that it exists because they've started a leak investigation and have complained publicly about who leaked it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=365.16s)]
*  So they have admitted that the report exists. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=371.8s)]
*  What they're trying to say now is that it was an early assessment. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=375.96000000000004s)]
*  And lo and behold, since new assessments have come out, much different now, much different. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=381.6s)]
*  But they had those assessments have not been shared. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=387.76s)]
*  No, of course not. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=389.92s)]
*  In fact, in fact, they had a closed door classified briefing, I believe, with Democrats and Republicans in Congress today. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=390.88s)]
*  Chris Murphy walked out of the briefing and he told reporters that he is, quote, still under the belief that we have not obliterated the program. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=399.36s)]
*  It's certain there's still significant capability and equipment that remain. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=406.12s)]
*  So in the end, what the report said, it's worth noting, the New York Times and CNN said it was an early assessment in the reporting. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=410.96s)]
*  I think the headline was early assessment, but we are where we are. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=417.44s)]
*  And all the rest is just fucking noise. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=422.0s)]
*  And it's a press conference with an audience of one. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=424.76s)]
*  It's just like lying all over the place and people that you can't trust have lost their credibility all over the place. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=427.24s)]
*  Because in the original story, even before the early Intel assessment that leaked, David Sanger wrote a piece. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=433.52s)]
*  About everything that happened, the strike, the aftermath of the strike, like a day or two after. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=440.96000000000004s)]
*  And that was the piece that has had Israeli officials saying that they think that the enriched uranium was moved and all that kind of stuff. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=446.40000000000003s)]
*  And then Barack Ravid, the Axios reporter, said, oh, now Israeli officials telling him that actually they agree with Trump, that it was completely obliterated and it's been set back years. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=455.24s)]
*  But it's like, who can trust Netanyahu and his government now? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=468.04s)]
*  And there's a report today that European countries were given an assessment that seemed very similar to the early one from the United States. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=471.03999999999996s)]
*  Right. All of this is so stupid. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=478.0s)]
*  It's so dumb because it's all beyond the point. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=480.36s)]
*  We're arguing about how far the bombs went down the hole. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=483.59999999999997s)]
*  Right. We're not having like and how the how damaged facilities were, which I guess is somewhat relevant. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=489.52s)]
*  The bigger question, there are two bigger questions. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=495.8s)]
*  One is, where is the highly enriched uranium? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=498.08s)]
*  Right. No one has an answer to that. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=501.15999999999997s)]
*  Seems like a problem. No one is contending it was destroyed. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=502.76s)]
*  I mean, other than Trump. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=505.08s)]
*  But like no one, there's no report saying that. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=506.32s)]
*  No one seems to know. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=508.88s)]
*  There's no one explaining why it wasn't moved, because obviously it was moved. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=510.0s)]
*  But to where and were we able to destroy it? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=515.9599999999999s)]
*  And the second point here is, even if this was the most, this really was the perfect strike, the most successful possible version of this mission. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=518.3199999999999s)]
*  All you're doing is delaying Iran's ambitions longer. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=527.96s)]
*  Maybe it's not a few months. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=533.8000000000001s)]
*  Maybe it's a year. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=535.0s)]
*  Maybe it's two years. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=536.2s)]
*  But you're going to end up in the same place. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=537.08s)]
*  Is why this was an ill fated decision from the very beginning, because you're going to end up back in the place where they are on the cusp of having a nuclear weapon. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=539.12s)]
*  And now, because we took this strike, the chances of resolving that through diplomatic means are greatly reduced. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=546.88s)]
*  Yeah, because they Trump Trump believed he could bomb them back to the table. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=554.0s)]
*  Which seems unlikely, or it seems unlikely that if they do come back to the table, they'll have any level of credibility, any level of trust in the Trump administration. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=558.32s)]
*  And why should they? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=566.1600000000001s)]
*  And and this is the whole like no one is suggesting that it was the military or the pilots that didn't successfully obliterated. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=568.52s)]
*  They did everything they were told to do. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=578.2800000000001s)]
*  The person who told them to do it made a dumb fucking move by deciding to bomb these sites without letting more diplomacy take hold or having no plan for what happens after the sites were bombed. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=580.32s)]
*  And also, by the way, blabbing his fucking mouth about the fact that he might bomb them. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=593.68s)]
*  And so they could move the enriched uranium in time, which he did and which the Defense Department told the New York Times on background that, by the way, he was their biggest. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=599.8s)]
*  He was their biggest opsec problem. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=610.36s)]
*  The president of the United States. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=612.68s)]
*  It's such this is like the this is a pre Trump Republican playbook movement, which is if you disagree with a military operation, you're anti-tribe. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=613.88s)]
*  You oppose the Iraq War, you were anti-tribe. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=622.0s)]
*  And they're doing the same thing here. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=624.28s)]
*  And it's like it doesn't wear very well. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=625.44s)]
*  It's it's it was like a I guess a somewhat effective cudgel in the early 2000s. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=627.16s)]
*  But right now it looks ridiculous. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=631.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's also they're all because Trump has to say everything is perfect and everything was obliterated. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=633.12s)]
*  And it's the greatest operation in history. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=639.6s)]
*  Imagine if Trump had come out and just said, like, yeah, I think we set back their program for a few years. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=641.4s)]
*  No one's going to say, like, actually, it was a few months. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=646.52s)]
*  Like, you might get a little reporting on that, but just say that the mission was successful. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=648.5600000000001s)]
*  We severely, you know, hampered their ability to make a nuclear weapon. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=654.0s)]
*  And now we're going to do X, Y and Z. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=658.6800000000001s)]
*  But they can't do it because they don't have a plan and because all they want is a short term success to brag about. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=660.28s)]
*  That's it. That's all they think. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=665.48s)]
*  That's all. That's how Trump thinks. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=666.32s)]
*  And Trump can only speak in superlatives. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=667.72s)]
*  Yes. Everything's the greatest best ever. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=669.2800000000001s)]
*  Now we have a government that has to then go back and try to make all of those things true, which is an impossible and ridiculous and stupid standard. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=671.12s)]
*  Quinnipiac poll came out and apparently only 41 percent of Americans support the strike. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=677.2s)]
*  And this is after the strike and 50 percent opposed, which is actually lower numbers than I thought. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=683.08s)]
*  I thought that more people would be for it just because it seemed to have gone OK. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=688.2800000000001s)]
*  And there's thank God no U.S. casualties and no wider war yet. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=693.4000000000001s)]
*  But, you know, I think people are smarter than they're given credit for and and get that this could mean that we're drawn into a larger war if not now later. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=697.88s)]
*  There's been several polls that have come out since the strike. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=707.6800000000001s)]
*  You have a Reuters poll, you have a CNN poll, you have the Quinnipiac poll and all of them show the same thing. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=709.88s)]
*  Majority opposition to the strikes, somewhere between 70 and 85 percent of people concerned that this is going to drive us into a wider war. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=714.96s)]
*  The CNN poll finds that people both people think that the result of the strike is that Iran is more likely to build a nuclear weapon than to not do so. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=722.24s)]
*  And I think it's 49 percent of CNN poll don't trust Trump to make the right decisions here. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=730.16s)]
*  We are so far beyond sort of reflexive post 9-11 rally around the flag on these things. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=734.12s)]
*  People have seen this movie before. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=741.52s)]
*  They know what happens. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=744.16s)]
*  They know and they know the results is nothing good for America. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=745.44s)]
*  Yeah. So Trump had a big event on the White House on Thursday. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=747.92s)]
*  The point was to sell his big bill of bullshit. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=752.32s)]
*  Look at you with your new BB BB BB. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=755.96s)]
*  I just I just I've found myself saying it. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=757.88s)]
*  I hate saying it, as I said earlier today in our meeting. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=761.8s)]
*  And so it just bullshit was just the easiest thing to come out of my mouth. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=764.2s)]
*  Just I like I don't know if it'll stick. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=766.88s)]
*  It's it's up to us if it sticks. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=768.48s)]
*  We should think of other B words, though. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=769.88s)]
*  It's also it's also beleaguered right now. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=771.56s)]
*  It's a beleaguered bill. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=773.92s)]
*  Is that a word? Is that a word that really rolls off the tongue? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=775.8s)]
*  No, it doesn't roll off the tongue, but it is used in the correct context here. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=778.2s)]
*  It is a it is a political coverage. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=781.48s)]
*  It's the media likes to use that. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=783.4s)]
*  Everyone's beleaguered anyway. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=785.4399999999999s)]
*  So he does this event. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=787.4s)]
*  He stands in front of a backdrop of regular Americans [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=788.84s)]
*  dressed up like the village people to make it obvious what jobs they have, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=793.04s)]
*  what they're going through. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=797.4s)]
*  They're they're again, tell their stories, why each of them might benefit from the bill. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=798.52s)]
*  Trump listed off a bunch of things that are in the bill, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=803.1999999999999s)]
*  some things that aren't in the bill. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=805.48s)]
*  He's talked about no tax on Social Security. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=806.72s)]
*  That's not in the bill at all. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=808.8s)]
*  But he's promised that in the in the event today. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=810.0s)]
*  And then he urged Congress to pass it before his July 4th deadline. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=814.2s)]
*  Seems unlikely, because here's where we are with this shit burger. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=818.8s)]
*  You might remember that during the interminable debate [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=823.0s)]
*  over the Biden administration's BBB, because everyone has their own BBB, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=825.28s)]
*  apparently, there was a point in the process where the Senate parliamentarian, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=828.64s)]
*  who is possibly the most powerful nerd in America, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=833.2s)]
*  ruled on whether anything in the bill broke the budget rules. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=837.4s)]
*  And the budget rules are you can only include stuff in a budget bill [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=840.24s)]
*  that primarily impacts the federal budget. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=844.76s)]
*  And so you can't use a budget bill to change laws. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=848.56s)]
*  That's cheating, because if you're changing the laws, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=852.0799999999999s)]
*  you got to find 60 votes instead of 51. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=855.0s)]
*  You only need 51 to pass a budget bill. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=857.84s)]
*  You need 60 votes to pass anything else. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=859.76s)]
*  So when there's a budget bill, the parliamentarian goes through it and says, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=862.16s)]
*  no, this doesn't just primarily impact the federal budget. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=865.64s)]
*  It also changes a law here or changes this or that. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=868.16s)]
*  So on Thursday, the parliamentarian said that a lot of the changes to Medicaid [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=871.32s)]
*  do not comply with the rules. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=875.6800000000001s)]
*  John Thune, who's in charge of the circus, said, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=878.48s)]
*  we have contingency plans and quote, we're plowing forward. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=881.32s)]
*  But the coverage on this matter includes heavy usage of the word scramble. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=885.36s)]
*  Everyone is scrambling. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=891.6s)]
*  The Republicans are scrambling right now, scrambling for votes, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=895.76s)]
*  scrambling to figure out the math, scrambling to figure out [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=898.88s)]
*  whether they can throw more or less people off their health care. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=902.48s)]
*  What do you think, Dan? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=907.24s)]
*  What's how big of a deal is what the parliamentarian is doing to the bill? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=908.2s)]
*  And what are Republicans options? Sure. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=912.08s)]
*  So let's try to take this in two parts. There's what's the in. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=915.0s)]
*  How does the problem is ruling affect the substance of the bill [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=918.6800000000001s)]
*  and how does it affect passage of the bill? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=921.24s)]
*  So the substance of the bill, there are a whole bunch of like really [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=923.0s)]
*  pretty onerous, stupid, cruel things that were in there that get tossed out, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=925.36s)]
*  you know, bans on using Medicaid funding for gender affirming care [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=929.08s)]
*  for trans youth and adults, a bunch of things to make it harder [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=931.8s)]
*  for people to repay their loans or get their student loans forgiven. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=934.44s)]
*  Some provisions to make it harder for legal immigrants to access benefits, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=938.08s)]
*  the guarantee to them by a bunch of like really bad stuff. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=941.08s)]
*  Mike Lee's thing about selling off public land, federal lands, federal lands. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=943.5600000000001s)]
*  And then the Medicaid provider tax provisioned. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=948.72s)]
*  Is a it's a huge deal. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=951.8s)]
*  It you know, it would bankrupt rural hospitals. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=953.5600000000001s)]
*  It would force states to cut services, which could lead to [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=957.2s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of people losing coverage over the course [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=961.36s)]
*  of the next several years. It's a it's a very big deal. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=964.08s)]
*  And so the bill, the Medicaid versions of the of the bill are less bad with that out. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=966.72s)]
*  If now in terms of passage, here's where we are. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=971.36s)]
*  If the Medicaid provider tax provisions stay out, then [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=976.08s)]
*  they either have to find more, even less popular Medicaid cuts or [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=980.4399999999999s)]
*  send a bill back to the House with the raises deficit even more, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=986.16s)]
*  which it may which compounds the problems they were already having, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=990.52s)]
*  because there are sort of three main buckets of problems [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=993.4399999999999s)]
*  between the Senate and the House right now. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=996.48s)]
*  The first will be the deficit. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=997.88s)]
*  And if the Medicaid provider tax is not in there, higher deficits. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=998.96s)]
*  The Chip Roy's of the world, the freedom crocs people, they get kind of squirrely. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1002.36s)]
*  The second is the state and local tax exemption. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1005.32s)]
*  The Senate has has trimmed that back. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1008.3199999999999s)]
*  The quote unquote salties from New York and California are still are quite salty. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1011.4s)]
*  If you will. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1015.3199999999999s)]
*  And then the third thing is the the Senate delays [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1018.52s)]
*  the repeal of some of the clean tax, clean energy tax credits [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1022.4399999999999s)]
*  from the inflation reduction act. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1026.12s)]
*  And the House is very pissed about that. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1028.2s)]
*  Steve Scalise today came out and said, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1029.3999999999999s)]
*  you'd have to go back to where the House was to get it passed. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1030.6s)]
*  So all of that makes this very tricky path to passing the bill. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1033.24s)]
*  That much trickier on a very short timeline. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1037.56s)]
*  If you really do want to get to Trump's July 4th deadline. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1040.96s)]
*  We've been saying this for a while, that it's very tough to reconcile [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1043.9199999999998s)]
*  the desire to make these deep cuts to Medicaid and food assistance [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1049.1599999999999s)]
*  and other programs and also [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1053.72s)]
*  not add trillions more to the deficit. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1058.08s)]
*  Like it's just a math problem. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1060.56s)]
*  I still like the the the worst this is going for them. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1062.52s)]
*  And I think even the more I think, I wonder why they don't just [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1066.44s)]
*  extend the tax cuts and call it a day and just say that we're going to do [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1071.16s)]
*  everything else next year or some other time, or we're going to split it into [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1074.8s)]
*  two big bills of bullshit. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1078.48s)]
*  You know, I don't know. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1082.52s)]
*  Like, what do you feel? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1083.48s)]
*  I mean, because just just reading the comments from and I realize [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1085.72s)]
*  that most of these people, I realize that the high likelihood is [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1090.1200000000001s)]
*  that all these people cave in the end. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1093.92s)]
*  And I'm not mad about deficits, whether you're mad about the Medicaid cuts, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1095.76s)]
*  whether you're mad about salt like Donald Trump at the end tells you, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1098.4s)]
*  vote for the bill, you vote for the fucking bill. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1101.72s)]
*  But Marjorie Taylor Green posted today that she's a no right now. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1103.44s)]
*  You know, the Chip Roy's, the Andy Harris's, all those people, the Freedom Caucus, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1109.04s)]
*  they're like, this is crazy. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1112.44s)]
*  Bill Cassidy, Senator, Republican senator, said the Medicaid cuts [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1113.48s)]
*  and the senator too much now. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1116.96s)]
*  And so he wants to go back to the House Medicaid cuts, which were still fucking awful. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1118.48s)]
*  So I don't it's definitely not. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1123.28s)]
*  I can't see it getting done by July 4th, that's for sure. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1125.28s)]
*  Yeah, I'm skeptical to do that, because at every other recent time [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1128.6799999999998s)]
*  where we've thought they can't get this done on a short time frame, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1131.8s)]
*  they have gotten it done because Trump was able to bully these folks into it. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1134.3999999999999s)]
*  I think when you think about to answer your question about [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1137.8799999999999s)]
*  why don't they just extend the tax cuts and you have to put the debt [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1140.2s)]
*  ceiling in there as well. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1143.6799999999998s)]
*  I think it's going to be hard to get people to vote to extend the debt [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1144.6799999999998s)]
*  ceiling without some form of cuts in there. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1147.84s)]
*  That becomes a problem. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1150.2s)]
*  And those Democrats have to bail them out on that, which we absolutely should not do. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1150.84s)]
*  But the other there's also just a mentality change like in our mind. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1154.08s)]
*  And we are right. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1157.52s)]
*  But let me simply in our mind, Republicans paid a huge [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1158.48s)]
*  political price in the 2018 midterms because they tried to repeal [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1161.24s)]
*  the Affordable Care Act. Yeah. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1165.1599999999999s)]
*  In the Republican mindset and in Trump's mindset, they paid a huge price [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1166.9199999999998s)]
*  in the 2018 midterms because they failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1170.28s)]
*  It was the failure, not the attempt. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1173.6399999999999s)]
*  And so the idea that you like and a simple [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1175.36s)]
*  year extension to your extension of the tax cuts would be seen as a failure. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1179.6s)]
*  And so that that is a motive. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1183.36s)]
*  That is why Thune and others say failure is not an option, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1184.8799999999999s)]
*  because they think that would be worse for them, because it would. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1187.56s)]
*  I don't agree with this analysis, but it deflates the base, the [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1189.68s)]
*  deflates the donor base, all of that, if you can't get what you promised done. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1192.56s)]
*  It's literally the only bill they've tried to pass the whole year. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1197.0s)]
*  I mean, I do. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1199.48s)]
*  I do agree that if they fail to pass it, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1201.04s)]
*  they could get donors and some base voters pissed off. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1204.04s)]
*  And they also still get the Medicaid ads that they tried to cut Medicaid. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1208.24s)]
*  So they sort of get the worst of all worlds because everything they proposed [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1213.76s)]
*  is still out there is something that they proposed. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1217.52s)]
*  So the parliamentarian screws them over and in their mind. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1220.4399999999998s)]
*  And, you know, one thing is to just figure out a way to make the math work [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1224.72s)]
*  by doing other cuts or tax increases, who knows, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1229.84s)]
*  or just adding to the deficit or whatever else. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1233.48s)]
*  But then, of course, there's already some Republicans who are arguing [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1235.32s)]
*  that you can also either overrule the parliamentarian, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1238.28s)]
*  ignore the parliamentarian, get the votes to overrule or fire the parliamentarian. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1241.84s)]
*  And Thune has already said this is not a good option. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1248.28s)]
*  So in some key quotes on this from Republicans, one is, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1252.56s)]
*  how is it that an unelected swamp bureaucrat who was appointed by Harry [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1257.08s)]
*  Reid over a decade ago gets to decide what can and cannot go [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1260.52s)]
*  in President Trump's one big, beautiful bill? [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1263.68s)]
*  That was Florida Congressman Greg Stubbe. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1266.0800000000002s)]
*  There's also this quote, Democrats can't let an unelected bureaucrat [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1268.88s)]
*  stand in the way of popular and necessary policies. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1272.04s)]
*  That was Dan Pfeiffer in 2021. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1274.5600000000002s)]
*  All right. Thank you, Tim Russert, throwing my own quotes back against me. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1276.76s)]
*  Honestly, that was a that was a Reid Cherlin special. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1279.6000000000001s)]
*  After I told Reid that I held this position, so I'm sure he's not [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1282.2s)]
*  digging through the message box archives to find that the context of that quote, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1284.64s)]
*  which I 100 percent stand by, because I am not someone who clings to norms [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1288.1200000000001s)]
*  as America falls into a fascistic dystopian future like some of you [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1291.92s)]
*  was during. You know another word for norms is, Dan, democracy. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1297.44s)]
*  You know, another word for democracy is to quote a Matt Iglesias is [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1303.1200000000001s)]
*  norms in a trench coat. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1306.2s)]
*  The the context of that quote was when Democrats were trying to [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1309.5600000000002s)]
*  pass the Voting Rights Act and we had 50 votes for it. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1314.88s)]
*  We did not have fit. We did. But we did not have the 60 needed for the [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1318.28s)]
*  filibuster to get by the filibuster. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1321.0s)]
*  And we had two senators who you may remember from that period of time, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1323.2s)]
*  Chris and Sidham and Joe Manchin, who would not over who would not [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1326.24s)]
*  eliminate the filibuster to pass a voting rights bill. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1330.92s)]
*  And so I believe that and I believe now that the right thing to do would have [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1333.92s)]
*  been to do everything we possibly could to pass the voting rights bill, because [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1337.2s)]
*  ultimately. But that wasn't a that wasn't a parliamentarian issue. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1340.64s)]
*  It was a problem. I'm sure. Because they were trying to do they were trying to do [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1344.24s)]
*  voting rights in a budget bill. Yes, there is a part you can do. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1346.6s)]
*  Obviously, that doesn't comply. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1349.76s)]
*  You can do that. You can do the whole thing. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1351.72s)]
*  But there was a whole theory you could do. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1353.28s)]
*  You could do some of it some of it that way. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1354.84s)]
*  I remember it with minimum wage was the that's the one that everyone got bad at [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1356.44s)]
*  cinema because we tried to put minimum a higher minimum wage in the budget bill, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1359.32s)]
*  which you could argue is like, you know, tangentially related at least to the [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1362.16s)]
*  federal budget. And then they overrule that. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1365.48s)]
*  I mean, look, obviously to follow Miles's law, like where you stand depends on [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1367.2s)]
*  where you sit. So right now, I'm very pleased with the parliamentarian. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1370.64s)]
*  But the idea that we are allowing a rule set by Robert Byrd, a Senate [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1373.24s)]
*  rule set by Robert Byrd, not a law, right? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1378.2s)]
*  Not a you know, not some something in the Constitution to determine [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1380.8400000000001s)]
*  what the majority of the country and the majority of the Senate wants, I think, is [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1385.6000000000001s)]
*  one of the problems with the Senate writ large. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1388.52s)]
*  I mean, I still think that the filibuster is a problem and it should go, even though [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1391.56s)]
*  we're standing where we are right now and Republicans have the Senate, because [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1394.8400000000001s)]
*  I just think that the the chances that Democrats ever get 60 [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1397.8400000000001s)]

*  not 60. So, yeah, I mean, which is, by the way, why all this stuff is getting done [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1420.04s)]
*  in budget bills, right? Because that's the only kind of bill that you can get 51 [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1423.6000000000001s)]

*  And the consequence of that is that sometimes it's going to fall where the [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1445.0400000000002s)]

*  It is. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1770.28s)]
*  It's Bushwick. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1770.76s)]
*  A lot of yes. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1771.3999999999999s)]
*  So Zoran beat the polls and Andrew Cuomo by seven points. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1773.0s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1778.28s)]
*  Like there were what was the what was the Emerson poll? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1780.52s)]
*  The Emerson poll had him like leading by a few maybe a couple. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1784.28s)]
*  No, I didn't see any poll that had seven seven points. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1788.84s)]
*  It was a big enough lead that Cuomo conceded without waiting for the rank choice process [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1792.28s)]
*  to play out. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1797.1599999999999s)]
*  So we that's not that's not even the final margin yet from for Zoran. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1797.72s)]
*  It could be bigger than that when they actually finish rank choice that rank choice process. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1802.2s)]
*  So Mamdani now moves on to the general election where he will face incumbent mayor Eric Adams, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1806.6s)]
*  who's running as an independent and will have lots of money to spend along with perennial [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1812.44s)]
*  Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa Sliwa Sliwa Sliwa perennial, but I don't know him and various [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1816.76s)]
*  no names. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1824.04s)]
*  There have been just a few takes on Mamdani's win. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1825.4s)]
*  I don't know if you've heard any. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1828.04s)]
*  Let's start with Republicans who've really been having a normal one. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1829.72s)]
*  Going to read you a few choice reactions, Dan. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1833.3200000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1836.3600000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump Jr. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1837.24s)]
*  Reposted a tweet that said, quote, I'm old enough to remember when New Yorkers endured 9-11 [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1838.8400000000001s)]
*  instead of voting for it. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1844.68s)]
*  So that was cool. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1847.16s)]
*  That's from the president's son, Laura Loomer, proud Islamophobe, as what she calls herself, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1847.8s)]
*  also said Mamdani's win would lead to another 9-11. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1853.72s)]
*  She just said that. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1857.32s)]
*  Elise Stefanik, who wants to now that she didn't get her dream job at the UN, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1858.68s)]
*  might run for governor of New York. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1863.48s)]
*  She called him a jihadist terrorist sympathizer. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1865.6399999999999s)]
*  Jihadist, which is that's really nice. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1869.0s)]
*  And then Donald Trump himself called Mamdani a quote, 100% communist lunatic. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1871.48s)]
*  And of course, the gang over at Fox News, they took up the course right away. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1877.9599999999998s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1882.12s)]
*  I cannot believe that New York is about to elect Adam Sandler, the hairdresser as mayor [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1883.1599999999999s)]

*  The Democrats have gone so far left. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1890.4399999999998s)]
*  They're socialist now. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1892.12s)]
*  It's President Trump that's really in the middle looking at everybody and governing that way. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1893.32s)]
*  He's going to turn the prisons inside out and he's going to turn whole foods into no foods. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1897.64s)]
*  Unless rich New Yorkers band together, donate a lot of money, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1903.8s)]
*  and create a groundswell for a viable alternative to Mamdani, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1907.56s)]
*  another great American city is going to swirl down the drain. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1911.48s)]
*  You know what creates a groundswell? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1915.72s)]
*  Lots of money. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1917.16s)]
*  Mamdani. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1917.88s)]
*  Maga diehard Andy Ogles of Tennessee. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1921.88s)]
*  This is some sick shit. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1924.0400000000002s)]

*  who was born in Uganda, so that he can be denaturalized and deported [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1930.2s)]

*  I don't know, Dan, what is wrong with these people? [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1939.48s)]
*  I mean, something very wrong. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1941.16s)]
*  I just, this is the least important point possible. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1942.5200000000002s)]
*  But in the Adam Sandler movie, Don't Mess With Zohan, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1945.4s)]
*  he was in this really super spy slash hairdresser. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1947.88s)]
*  I didn't even know that was a movie, Dan. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1949.96s)]
*  Yeah, I guess I haven't kept up on my Adam Sandler. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1951.72s)]
*  I think it's from a long time. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1955.4s)]
*  Catalog. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1956.3600000000001s)]
*  2008, we were, you were busy that year. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1959.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, well, I was working for working for another secret Muslim born in Africa. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1961.48s)]
*  I guess, I guess not so secret now. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1967.48s)]
*  Uh, so it, I'm actually like, I'm surprised by the level and breadth of reaction from [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1969.72s)]
*  the right on this. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1979.16s)]
*  Like, I thought that they would be, I mean, I thought that they would say some of this shit, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1980.76s)]
*  but the fact that it has been like nonstop for a couple days, I don't know. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1986.12s)]
*  I guess I can always be shocked by this. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1991.4s)]
*  I'm not shocked. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1993.32s)]
*  The, the sort of the vitriol and the racism and the hatred that doesn't surprise me, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=1994.68s)]
*  just that they, I guess they're, they don't have anything else to do right now. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2001.4s)]
*  So they're really all in. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2004.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2006.68s)]
*  This is very much on brand. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2007.8000000000002s)]
*  It's like, I'm sure it like, it drives ratings for them and makes them happy. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2009.8000000000002s)]
*  And frankly, the big wigs in right wing media based in New York City, too, like all these [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2013.96s)]
*  Fox people live in there in the middle of this. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2018.5200000000002s)]
*  I don't know how effective this is. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2020.44s)]
*  Because it's so over the top and so extreme and, you know, Charlie Kirk and Stephen Miller [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2021.88s)]
*  and Matt Walsh and the rest of them, they're out there saying, you know, there's just too [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2030.2s)]
*  many immigrants in New York and there's New York is full of foreign born, you know, a [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2035.0s)]
*  third of all the citizens in New York now are foreign born and two thirds of all children [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2039.88s)]
*  in New York City live in a, in the household where one of the parents is foreign born. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2044.68s)]
*  And we can't have any more third world migration at all. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2050.2000000000003s)]
*  Just being, just, just saying the quiet part out loud that it's not about illegal immigration [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2053.1600000000003s)]
*  to them at all. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2058.92s)]
*  It's about legal immigration. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2059.5600000000004s)]
*  They don't like immigrants in this country. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2061.4s)]
*  Also, New York City has been about a third foreign born citizens in New York City since [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2063.88s)]
*  at least 2000. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2072.44s)]
*  It's been the almost the exact same margin. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2074.44s)]
*  It's been the almost the exact same margin. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2076.6s)]
*  And then really since New York City became a city, it was, it was, it was either a little [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2078.44s)]
*  higher than that or a little lower. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2085.32s)]
*  Like there's just been no, they want you to think that the country is changing and that [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2086.52s)]
*  there's all these foreign born people in the country now and mass migration. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2091.0s)]
*  And really it just, in a city like New York, it just hasn't changed all that much. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2094.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2098.28s)]
*  I mean, well, obviously you remember that the Statue of Liberty went up during the Biden [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2098.76s)]
*  administration. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2101.88s)]
*  It's like, that's when you truly open the doors. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2103.4s)]
*  That was, that was the gift he took. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2105.2400000000002s)]
*  Unlike the $400 million plane, but it was the same idea. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2108.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2110.36s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2110.6000000000004s)]
*  So the rich Wall Street types, they are also very upset about Madani. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2111.8s)]
*  They're quoting on CNBC, they're quoting Dark Knight saying, quote, they're taking [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2117.48s)]
*  Wall Streeters and making them walk out onto the ice and the East river. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2122.84s)]
*  And then they fall through. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2126.44s)]
*  That's true. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2127.56s)]
*  Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman wrote one of his trademark 1000 word diatribes on Twitter, [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2129.56s)]
*  begging someone to launch a write-in campaign. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2136.92s)]
*  And then he promised to help fund it and said the money will be there. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2139.88s)]
*  If someone wants to just step up and run a campaign that would do a write-in thing, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2143.48s)]
*  then the billionaires will fund it. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2148.2s)]
*  And then the Times reports that Eric Adams has already met with business and finance [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2150.84s)]
*  leaders to talk about how to stop Mumdani. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2154.12s)]
*  Nice of these guys to do free campaign ads for Zoran, huh? [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2157.16s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2160.2s)]
*  Billionaires mad at Mumdani. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2161.16s)]
*  It's going to be a huge, huge, huge political problem for him. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2162.6s)]
*  I mean, what do you make of this? [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2167.4s)]
*  This is not surprising. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2170.04s)]
*  The more likely scenario is they get behind Adams. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2171.08s)]
*  It's easier. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2175.0s)]
*  He's already, he already has ballot access and we know he can be bought since he both [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2175.88s)]
*  was indicted for bribery. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2181.96s)]
*  Yeah, just ask the Turks. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2183.08s)]
*  Yes, but then he traded, then he was bribed again in exchange for a pardon. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2185.24s)]
*  So it's like, or having his charges dropped, I guess. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2190.3599999999997s)]
*  So yeah, I think they're going to, I think they will get behind him. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2193.0s)]
*  There will be a full, full New York City freak out about this over the next several months. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2195.56s)]
*  Do you think Cuomo gets back in and runs on some other party's ticket? [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2200.68s)]
*  I mean, he did so poorly. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2205.9599999999996s)]
*  I'm not sure anyone would want him to do that. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2207.9599999999996s)]
*  It wasn't like he got in late and almost got there or started weak and grew strong. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2209.8799999999997s)]
*  He got his ass kicked and was a terrible candidate. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2215.08s)]
*  So I don't know that, I don't know that people will put more good money after bad. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2217.96s)]
*  There is an amazing quote from one of the hedge fund guys who gave $250,000 to this [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2221.88s)]
*  pro Cuomo super PAC who's now going to back Mondani. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2227.48s)]
*  And he said, don't mistake my $250,000 donation for enthusiasm for Andrew Cuomo. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2231.0s)]
*  We just thought he might win. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2237.48s)]
*  And this is how you have to play the game with Andrew Cuomo. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2238.6s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2241.64s)]
*  This is amazing. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2242.36s)]
*  Clearly, the knives are out for Zoran and the Wall Street people, the finance people, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2244.2s)]
*  Republicans, Republicans nationally, we're about to talk about some Democrats, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2252.92s)]
*  are going to just sort of empty the oppo file and really try to raise awareness on some of [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2258.68s)]
*  his positions, past statements, all the rest. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2266.36s)]
*  I think a writing campaign is hard to pull off. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2269.96s)]
*  I think a writing campaign with Adams still in the race, then probably doesn't help. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2272.92s)]
*  You need to drive him to drop out. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2279.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2281.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2281.4s)]
*  Which I guess you could do. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2282.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2283.2400000000002s)]
*  So you need to drive him to drop out and then just have the writing candidate and Zoran. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2284.12s)]
*  And Eric Adams, like the guy, they haven't taken a poll lately, but as of late March, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2288.36s)]
*  I think his approval rating was sitting around 20%. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2295.2400000000002s)]
*  20%. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2297.64s)]
*  I suppose it could get to be a closer race, but I don't know how you come. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2300.52s)]
*  You're an incumbent mayor with a 20% approval rating and you're running in a city where [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2304.2s)]
*  Democratic registration and where Kamala Harris, obviously Trump made up some ground in New York [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2311.08s)]
*  in 2024, but I think Kamala Harris won the city by like what, 30, 40 points? [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2316.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2320.04s)]
*  I mean, also let's talk about Eric Adams for a second. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2320.44s)]
*  He is a incumbent mayor who left the Democratic Party, was indicted for bribery, and then in the [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2322.92s)]
*  state, in the city that Kamala Harris won overwhelmingly, he had the charges dropped [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2329.96s)]
*  for him in exchange for adopting some of Trump's deportation policies. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2334.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2339.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2339.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2340.28s)]
*  So it's not a good profile. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2340.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2342.76s)]
*  The ICE raids that New Yorkers hate right now are sponsored by Eric Adams because Donald Trump [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2342.92s)]
*  owns him. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2347.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2348.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2349.16s)]
*  It doesn't see anything as possible in American politics in 2025, but it's not a great starting [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2349.64s)]
*  spot for the Eric Adams for mayor campaign. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2357.7999999999997s)]
*  I want to read you some other negative reactions to Mumdani's win. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2359.72s)]
*  Quote, absolute wrong choice for New York, serious concerns, profoundly alarmed, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2363.64s)]
*  deeply disturbing pattern of unacceptable antisemitic comments. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2369.48s)]
*  Alas, those are all from Democrats. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2373.3999999999996s)]
*  The Axios headline says it all. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2376.6800000000003s)]
*  Democratic establishment melts down over Mumdani's win in New York. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2379.6400000000003s)]
*  The concern here, allegedly, is that the party's candidate in a 2025 mayoral race could, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2384.12s)]
*  quote, hurt the party's brand nationally in 2026 and 2028. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2390.6800000000003s)]
*  You wrote a message box on this already. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2396.36s)]
*  Would you like to tee off here? [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2398.6s)]
*  I'll let you go first if you would like. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2400.36s)]
*  No, you wrote the message box. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2402.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2404.36s)]
*  I'm just a lazy podcaster. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2404.84s)]
*  You're running a media empire and you're podcasting every 16 seconds. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2409.96s)]
*  You can draw a straight line between how members of the ossified, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2413.32s)]
*  scleratic, democratic establishment have responded to Trump's deportation raids, [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2418.28s)]
*  the bombing of Iran, and Mumdani's victory, which is they are governed by a culture of fear. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2423.6400000000003s)]
*  They're so afraid of losing that they're never going to win. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2430.2000000000003s)]
*  It's like we are thinking and we are reverse engineering our strategies and ideas, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2433.88s)]
*  not by what is best, what the best outcome is. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2437.88s)]
*  It's how do we minimize the worst outcome? [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2441.2400000000002s)]
*  What are Trump and the Republicans going to say about us? [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2444.1200000000003s)]
*  So you think about all these Democrats who have refused to endorse Mumdani yet. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2447.1600000000003s)]
*  Maybe they all will eventually. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2450.6800000000003s)]
*  Governor Hockel did a press conference today, which was, I think, just awkward and weird and not great. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2452.44s)]
*  Said she wasn't ready yet to endorse him. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2458.04s)]
*  So let's just think about that for a second. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2460.52s)]
*  Here you have a candidate who you may not agree with on all of the issues, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2462.92s)]
*  but he sparked a movement of young people, a diverse working class coalition of young people, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2467.08s)]
*  the exact people leaving our party across the board, the people we have to get back, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2476.52s)]
*  and you're going to walk away from him for what? [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2481.1600000000003s)]
*  So that you can support Eric Adams. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2484.1200000000003s)]
*  He's the Democratic nominee for mayor. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2485.56s)]
*  What is the alternative here? [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2489.4s)]
*  What are you afraid of? [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2490.84s)]
*  They're afraid of the ads. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2492.36s)]
*  They're afraid of the Republican ads. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2493.2400000000002s)]
*  The ads are coming either way. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2495.4s)]
*  You elected you're supporting this or you're standing with this Muslim socialist [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2498.2000000000003s)]
*  who is anti-Semitic and all the fucking garbage bullshit that they're saying. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2503.1600000000003s)]
*  The idea that they're going to be to use [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2508.6s)]
*  Mondani in ads to destroy Democrats around the country is absurd. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2512.36s)]
*  It doesn't. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2516.2000000000003s)]
*  It isn't borne out by evidence. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2516.6800000000003s)]
*  I've looked at this before. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2518.76s)]
*  In 2014, the Republicans put Nancy Pelosi in all of their ads, and they did great in the midterms. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2520.52s)]
*  In 2018, the Republicans put Nancy Pelosi in all of their ads, and they got their ass kicked. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2526.36s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi was in just about the same number of ads. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2531.2400000000002s)]
*  She was actually less popular in 2018 than she was in 2014, and Democrats did great. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2533.6400000000003s)]
*  There is just no connection to that. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2537.88s)]
*  It's just it is absurd. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2540.6800000000003s)]
*  Have to embrace his entire agenda. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2544.36s)]
*  You have to embrace everything he said. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2545.4s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2547.1600000000003s)]
*  But what he accomplished in this race, what he speaks about the future, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2548.6s)]
*  the hope he's given people is something that every Democrat should be learning from. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2552.12s)]
*  I'm infuriate. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2558.04s)]
*  Like, as you can tell, I am infuriate. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2558.6s)]
*  I'm speaking calmly, but I am boiling over with rage on the inside because it's so [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2560.52s)]
*  self-defeating and stupid. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2564.52s)]
*  If you wanted to endorse, if you didn't want to back him in the primary, [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2565.4s)]
*  back someone else. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2569.2400000000002s)]
*  I think it's gross to back Cuomo in that scenario. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2570.2s)]
*  But you want to back Brad Lander or one of the other candidates. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2572.04s)]
*  Great. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2575.56s)]
*  Go do that. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2575.96s)]
*  But now he's the nominee the voters have spoken and they spoke overwhelmingly. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2576.84s)]
*  He didn't win by some like, you know, where he got like 26 percent of the vote in a 12 [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2579.96s)]
*  candidate race. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2584.44s)]
*  He won overwhelmingly. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2585.2400000000002s)]
*  Support him. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2587.08s)]
*  He is the nominee. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2587.6400000000003s)]
*  I'm going to take it from this perspective. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2589.0s)]
*  Let's say you're a Democrat with good faith concerns about Mnandini. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2591.8s)]
*  Like you're just you're like, it's not about that. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2597.56s)]
*  I'm scared about the ads. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2599.2400000000002s)]
*  It's not that I'm just trying to punch left. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2600.36s)]
*  I'm genuinely concerned about him. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2601.96s)]
*  And the concerns really fall into the concerns that would make you not support the Democratic [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2604.12s)]
*  nominee for mayor. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2610.04s)]
*  If someone asks you again, like most of these most of these Democrats don't even fucking [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2611.32s)]
*  live in New York. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2615.2400000000002s)]
*  But you know, but you know, I'm sure they'll get asked right. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2616.6s)]
*  And so the concerns fall into two buckets. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2619.4s)]
*  I think one is the, you know, globalize the Intifada answer and all the charges of anti-Semitism [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2621.64s)]
*  that come with it. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2629.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2630.44s)]
*  So if you're concerned about that, I bet you could call him. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2631.16s)]
*  I bet you could meet with them. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2634.7599999999998s)]
*  You could talk to him, find out what he really thinks, find out what his beliefs are, because [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2635.88s)]
*  he has denounced anti-Semitism many, many times, not just in this campaign, but throughout [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2640.52s)]
*  his career. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2647.0s)]
*  If there's other things that concern you, just give the guy a call. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2647.56s)]
*  I'm sure he'd be happy to talk to you. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2650.6s)]
*  And then it's, oh, he's a socialist, right? [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2653.08s)]
*  We're worried about social policies. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2655.48s)]
*  Steve Ratner tweeted this today, and I believe the tweet was to be like, can you believe [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2657.32s)]
*  these are his policies? [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2662.84s)]
*  For those not paying a close attention, here are some of the things Mumdani believes. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2665.0800000000004s)]
*  Free buses, free childcare, and pay for childcare workers equal to teachers, free city university [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2669.0s)]
*  tuition, minimum wage of $30 per hour by 2030, rent freeze on apartments, end of May oral [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2675.2400000000002s)]
*  control of schools, city-owned grocery store program, raise corporate individual taxes [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2681.0s)]
*  for high earners. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2685.96s)]
*  It is very possible to disagree with some of those policies and to even say, like, I [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2690.84s)]
*  share the goal of making sure that more New Yorkers can afford to live, afford to buy a [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2697.16s)]
*  house, afford rent. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2702.28s)]
*  I don't know if rent control is going to work, right? [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2703.48s)]
*  Or, you know, I think that we need to spend money improving the buses before we make them [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2705.32s)]
*  free. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2711.0s)]
*  Like, there's a whole bunch of ways you can say, yeah, it might just differ on some of [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2711.4s)]
*  the policy. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2714.84s)]
*  But like, those policies are not some fucking like, take control of the means of production [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2715.64s)]
*  shit. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2722.3599999999997s)]
*  Also, the grocery store thing is a pilot program of one grocery store. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2723.4s)]
*  It's five. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2727.0s)]
*  Five. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2727.48s)]
*  So one per borough. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2727.7999999999997s)]
*  And as he said to, you know, I heard about it because I thought that too. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2729.4s)]
*  I'm like, people were like, nationalize the grocery stores. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2732.44s)]
*  And I'm like, what is that? [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2735.0s)]
*  And then I heard him talking to Tim Miller about it. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2736.12s)]
*  And he's like, it's a pilot program. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2738.04s)]
*  If it works, great. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2739.96s)]
*  If it doesn't work, we don't do it. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2741.24s)]
*  And that's why we're trying one per borough. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2743.24s)]
*  Food deserts are a huge problem. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2746.44s)]
*  So let's try to fix it. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2747.96s)]
*  Maybe it's not the right solution, but at least he's trying. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2749.48s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2751.8799999999997s)]
*  I said this before. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2752.3599999999997s)]
*  The guy could succeed wildly. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2753.56s)]
*  He could be fine. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2756.12s)]
*  He could fail as mayor. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2757.4s)]
*  But like, we let a lot of other Democratic politicians run cities, run states, go to [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2759.0s)]
*  Congress, and sometimes they do well. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2764.2s)]
*  Sometimes they do fucking horrible. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2766.12s)]
*  And then you vote them out of office. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2768.7599999999998s)]
*  Like, I just don't understand why this has to be the biggest fucking deal ever. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2770.2s)]
*  You mentioned the idea of punching left, right? [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2775.7999999999997s)]
*  This idea that you're going to show your independence by attacking people to your ideological flank. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2777.64s)]
*  The old phrase back in the 60s was hippie punching, right? [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2784.3599999999997s)]
*  And to think that that is a good idea in this environment shows that you fundamentally do [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2787.4s)]
*  not understand politics in the post-Trump era. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2791.96s)]
*  Because we do not exist on a continuum of left and right. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2794.3599999999997s)]
*  It is inside outside. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2797.8799999999997s)]
*  Which is exactly why Trump can make gains in New York City. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2799.8799999999997s)]
*  And a 33-year-old Democratic socialists can win the primary against the former governor. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2803.56s)]
*  Because both of them are change. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2808.84s)]
*  They represent, we can disagree about Trump, but they represent change. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2811.56s)]
*  They represent a challenge to the establishment. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2814.7599999999998s)]
*  So if you are, this is my advice to Democrats out there who are looking to show their independence [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2816.52s)]
*  because they feel weighed down by our absolutely dismal party brand right now. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2820.52s)]
*  Don't punch left, punch up. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2825.72s)]
*  What people are mad about is the Democratic establishment. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2827.96s)]
*  If you have a problem with your party, they want to see that you are willing to break [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2830.92s)]
*  with your party on that. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2836.28s)]
*  Not that just simply attacking people to the left to show you're moderate isn't answering [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2837.08s)]
*  the question the voters are asking. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2843.2400000000002s)]
*  They're asking, are you someone who can take on a broken political system? [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2844.84s)]
*  And you do that by showing that you are not going to be obedient to the party bosses. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2848.12s)]
*  Donald Trump tried to steal the last election when he failed, [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2853.56s)]
*  fomented a violent insurrection against the Capitol. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2859.32s)]
*  Cops were brutally assaulted. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2863.32s)]
*  They tried to kill members of Congress and his own vice president. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2865.0s)]
*  He then wins the election, pardons the people who violently assaulted cops. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2868.92s)]
*  And what we've had, at least at the beginning of the administration, [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2874.92s)]
*  is some Democrats being like, I'll work with them. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2878.04s)]
*  I'll work with them where it makes sense. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2880.6000000000004s)]
*  I'll vote for some of his nominees where they're good. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2882.76s)]
*  And then now we're like, oh, but if it's the mayor of New York City who wants to give people [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2885.8799999999997s)]
*  free buses and rent control and has said that he doesn't know if he's going to [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2894.52s)]
*  police the term, globalize the Intifada, even though he doesn't use it, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2901.16s)]
*  which is admittedly a dumb answer. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2905.24s)]
*  But for that, for him, we're going to say absolutely not. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2906.8399999999997s)]
*  This is very concerning. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2911.0s)]
*  But for Donald fucking Trump, be like, well, I'll work with them where I can. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2912.44s)]
*  If you are more concerned about a Democratic socialist in City Hall than a fascist in the [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2917.1600000000003s)]
*  White House, you are not living in the right times here, people. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2922.84s)]
*  Even if we're talking about right now, there's this whole debate where it's like, oh, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2928.2000000000003s)]
*  you know, a Democrat called for Trump's impeachment and this and that. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2931.6400000000003s)]
*  And it's like, yeah, I get that impeachment is a road to nowhere because we don't have the votes. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2935.48s)]
*  But like, of course, this man should be impeached if we fucking had the votes. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2940.12s)]
*  He shouldn't be in office. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2944.12s)]
*  But like Democrats are like, oh, I don't know. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2945.64s)]
*  No one can even say the word impeachment. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2949.24s)]
*  It's so scary. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2951.48s)]
*  We don't want to look too extreme. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2952.68s)]
*  But you know, when it comes to talking about Mamdani, they have no problems, [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2954.2799999999997s)]
*  no problems whatsoever. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2957.7999999999997s)]
*  And look, it's been a handful. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2960.92s)]
*  It's been a handful of people so far. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2963.56s)]
*  But don't want that to spread. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2965.4s)]
*  The congressional leadership in the House and the Senate have yet to endorse [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2967.56s)]
*  the Democratic nominee for mayor from the state in which the city in which they both live and vote. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2970.52s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2974.52s)]
*  You're going to end up endorsing it. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2976.2s)]
*  You know, of course, you are where this is going. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2977.8s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer aren't going to spend from now [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2981.48s)]
*  until fucking November just dancing around this. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2984.12s)]
*  They're not going to end up in a place where they fucking endorse Eric Adams. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2987.2400000000002s)]
*  And so what did they think? [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2990.52s)]
*  No one pulls a bandaid off more slowly than Democratic leadership. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2992.92s)]
*  Just just do it. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2997.72s)]
*  God, unbelievable, unbelievable. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=2999.88s)]
*  OK, this was cathartic. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3002.2s)]
*  It was cathartic. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3003.56s)]
*  I feel good now. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3004.28s)]
*  I thought that you would tee off and I would be the I would try to save [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3005.48s)]
*  save my anger, but I couldn't do it. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3010.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3011.88s)]
*  All right. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3012.44s)]
*  When we come back from the break, you'll hear my conversation with California [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3013.0s)]
*  Congressman Robert Garcia. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3015.56s)]
*  A quick announcement before that strict scrutiny dropped two bonus episodes this week, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3017.0s)]
*  one on the Supreme Court's Planned Parenthood decision, which was fucking awful, [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3021.16s)]
*  and another on the wave of major rulings that followed. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3024.44s)]
*  They break down what it means, how these decisions could affect people's lives. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3027.32s)]
*  So go check out strict scrutiny wherever you get your podcasts or watch them on YouTube. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3030.6800000000003s)]
*  When we come back, Robert Garcia, Pots A of America is brought to you by Sundays. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3035.32s)]
*  Sundays is fresh dog food made from a short list of human grade ingredients. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3039.4s)]
*  Sundays was co-founded by Dr. Tori Waxman, a practicing veterinarian who tested and [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3042.6000000000004s)]

*  Thank you. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3230.36s)]
*  Obviously, I'm just very grateful to the caucus. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3231.08s)]
*  And look, I think obviously the Oversight, as you know, is like the heart of what Congress does, [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3233.4s)]
*  which is transparency, investigations, holding the powerful accountable. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3237.8s)]
*  Obviously, we're going to hold Donald Trump accountable in new ways, and I'm looking [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3242.28s)]
*  forward to that. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3245.56s)]
*  And I think it was good for the party in the caucus to expand the tent and bring in some [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3247.0s)]
*  new folks. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3252.36s)]
*  And I think that's also a good sign for where the party is going, and I certainly hope so. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3252.84s)]
*  What power do you have for people who don't know on that committee as the ranking member, [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3257.88s)]
*  the minority party? [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3263.88s)]
*  Obviously, Republicans control Congress and control that committee. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3264.76s)]
*  And so what powers do you have and what do you plan to do with them? [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3268.36s)]
*  I mean, a couple of things. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3272.2000000000003s)]
*  I think one is, look, as a ranking member and certainly in the minority, we still have [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3272.92s)]
*  investigative power. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3277.88s)]
*  So we can still launch investigations. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3278.6800000000003s)]
*  We can still work and try to get legislation done. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3280.9199999999996s)]
*  We can still push back in committees and outside to talk to the American people directly. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3283.3199999999997s)]
*  And I think it's really important that when we have these hearings that we're bringing [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3287.96s)]
*  the fire, that we're being honest and direct with the American public, that we're pushing [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3292.04s)]
*  back on every lie that is told by the far-mago right. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3296.2s)]
*  I mean, look, you've got Nancy Mace, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert, Jim Comer. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3300.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, this is kind of the worst of the worst of the liars and the extreme right in Congress. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3304.9199999999996s)]
*  And so we're going to have to push back and communicate the message, a winning message, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3310.68s)]
*  a message that's kind of forward looking for the country. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3315.96s)]
*  And then I think also at the same time, I want to build the best and the brightest, [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3319.08s)]
*  not just on the committee and invite new folks to join, but we're going to build a team of [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3322.8399999999997s)]
*  oversight staffers. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3327.96s)]
*  There's already some incredible team members, but we want to bring in even more folks that [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3329.0s)]
*  are committed to this work. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3334.2799999999997s)]
*  And they're also going to look at our committee structure that we can communicate more effectively [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3336.04s)]
*  to the American public. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3340.52s)]
*  We need to be in every single digital space communicating in a way that the American public [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3341.72s)]
*  can understand these investigations, that they're relatable to the American public, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3347.72s)]
*  and that they can see through the lies and deception of James Comer and Donald Trump. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3351.88s)]
*  So on that note, as you pointed out, you got some of the biggest clowns in the Republican [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3356.7599999999998s)]
*  party on that committee, like just attention starved clowns. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3360.6s)]
*  How do you think about balancing the need to push back, as you say, and call out the lies [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3366.84s)]
*  without helping them turn these hearings into a circus, which is what they want? [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3373.2400000000002s)]
*  And also turns off some people who are watching. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3380.92s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's two pieces of it. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3383.8s)]
*  I mean, look, they're bringing the clown show. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3385.48s)]
*  We've got Maxwell Frost and Gregg Kassar and Jasmine Crockett, Summer Lee, and so many others [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3388.2000000000003s)]
*  that are going to, I think, deliver and communicate broadly to the American public. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3394.92s)]
*  At the same time, I've told them and I've told the committee team that we're going to build [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3399.56s)]
*  a forward-looking agenda. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3403.88s)]
*  Not only are we going to focus on investigations and we're going to investigate not just Donald [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3405.64s)]
*  Trump, but corporate power that wants to abuse the American public. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3410.12s)]
*  We're going to take on some of the big issues that are happening right now, whether it's ICE [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3413.16s)]
*  or whether it's big corporations trying to rip off middle-class families. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3417.56s)]
*  We're also going to have a forward-looking agenda of government reform. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3421.64s)]
*  The committee is oversight and government reform. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3424.6s)]
*  And we don't do enough of that. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3428.36s)]
*  People want to see the federal government be more efficient, be more effective, and [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3430.12s)]
*  ensure that we're providing services quicker and faster to constituents. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3434.7599999999998s)]
*  These are all things that are highly popular across the country. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3438.36s)]
*  And so, yes, we need to be the opposition party and have investigations and bring that fire. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3441.72s)]
*  But we're going to lay out a vision for how we actually make government work better for people. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3446.7599999999998s)]
*  I think it's going to be highly popular and I'm really excited in putting together that plan. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3452.12s)]
*  And it sounds like that's something that Democrats could run on in the midterms. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3456.2799999999997s)]
*  100%. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3460.44s)]
*  And I think it's also something, I kind of pitched myself to the caucus as someone that's done [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3461.08s)]
*  a lot of government reform. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3466.44s)]
*  I was a big city mayor before I got to Congress. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3467.48s)]
*  It was a couple of years ago. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3469.48s)]
*  And we made government faster. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3471.0s)]
*  We used technology. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3472.6s)]
*  We brought in innovation. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3473.4s)]
*  We weren't afraid of efficiency. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3474.36s)]
*  Efficiency can't be a word that Republicans co-opt to mean the destruction of government. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3476.84s)]
*  Or doze or eliminating workers. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3481.96s)]
*  Efficiency can mean actually making government faster. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3484.6s)]
*  Making employees and the workforce be more attentive and work closer with the public [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3487.56s)]
*  and constituents and using technology to actually make our services work better. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3492.76s)]
*  So I think all of that is under our jurisdiction. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3497.48s)]
*  And I think it's also could be a forward-looking agenda that could absolutely help with the midterms. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3500.36s)]
*  So there's a story today about a Los Angeles family suing the Trump administration because [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3504.6s)]
*  armed federal agents wearing no uniform arrested their nine-year-old and six-year-old, [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3511.64s)]
*  who has leukemia, as they walked out of their asylum hearing with their mother. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3517.48s)]
*  This is from the story. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3521.88s)]
*  They were crying in fear. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3523.24s)]
*  One of the agents lifted up his shirt to display the gun he was carrying. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3524.44s)]
*  And the six-year-old was so terrified he urinated on himself. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3527.3199999999997s)]
*  No one offered him a change of clothing. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3530.44s)]
*  They were shipped to Texas. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3532.04s)]
*  And the six-year-old missed a medical appointment even though his cancer symptoms got worse. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3533.4s)]
*  These kids were enrolled in LA public schools. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3537.64s)]
*  I have run out of ways to express how outraged and disgusted I am by Stephen Miller terrorizing [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3541.24s)]
*  communities. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3550.2799999999997s)]
*  And the question I get asked all the time from people is, what more can we be doing about this? [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3552.2s)]
*  It feels like we hear these horrible stories and everyone speaks about them, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3557.48s)]
*  but what more can we be doing? [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3560.2799999999997s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3561.96s)]
*  First, what's happening right now is just it is so inhumane and gross. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3563.4s)]
*  And as an immigrant myself who came here as a young kid, [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3567.4s)]
*  it's not the America that so many immigrants come to to actually be a part of, to fight for, [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3570.76s)]
*  to fight for citizenship. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3577.88s)]
*  The American dream that immigrants are actually drawn to is being ripped away from people. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3579.64s)]
*  And the inhumanity, essentially dehumanizing immigrants so that they're less than human, [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3585.08s)]
*  is Stephen Miller doing what he loves to do, which is be essentially the biggest piece of shit [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3590.6s)]
*  in this country. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3596.6s)]
*  Stephen Miller should be ashamed for the way he's acting. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3597.88s)]
*  I can't even believe he's from our state, which actually makes me more sick. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3601.0s)]
*  And I'll say that what's happening right now is it's not just that story, which is horrific. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3606.2000000000003s)]
*  I mean, it's the data of those Marines that got essentially beat on a street. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3612.84s)]
*  It's children that are US citizens being deported, as we know, to other countries without consent. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3617.08s)]
*  Due process in our constitution is given to citizens and non-citizens. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3624.28s)]
*  It's all persons. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3629.4s)]
*  And I don't know what part of all persons that Christian Noem, [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3630.92s)]
*  Donald Trump, and Stephen Miller don't understand. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3634.6800000000003s)]
*  And so what has to happen now, I think you're seeing some of that. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3637.4s)]
*  One is we are winning some of these cases in the courts. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3640.6000000000004s)]
*  And I think that's been a really important vehicle for Democrats. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3644.1200000000003s)]
*  We've got to continue winning in the courts and that's going to continue. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3646.44s)]
*  And the other piece of it, people's reaction, the protesting, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3649.6400000000003s)]
*  the anger, the rising up against these actions also is having an effect. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3653.96s)]
*  And you're seeing that. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3658.44s)]
*  I mean, what's happening in LA, which was widely, as you know, mostly peaceful. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3659.2400000000002s)]
*  And yes, there were some incidents of violence. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3663.48s)]
*  We denounced those. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3665.0s)]
*  We get that. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3665.64s)]
*  But widely peaceful. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3666.44s)]
*  The protests are energizing the population and the public to stand up against this. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3668.36s)]
*  And we are seeing the impact it's having on the Republicans electorally. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3673.08s)]
*  I mean, Trump's immigration numbers have never been as low as they are right now [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3676.36s)]
*  because they're seeing what he wants to do implemented across the country. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3681.0s)]
*  So that's going to be really important. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3684.12s)]
*  And then finally, Democrats in Congress and across the country, we got to fight. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3685.88s)]
*  We've got to continue to fight really hard. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3689.72s)]
*  It does feel in these last few weeks, last month or so, that there is a shift happening. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3692.12s)]
*  I really do sense that Democrats, we've found people have found their footing. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3698.2s)]
*  They're being more aggressive. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3702.92s)]
*  They're getting out in the street more. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3704.28s)]
*  And so I hope that wave kind of continues. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3706.28s)]
*  And hopefully we can stop the worst from happening [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3709.08s)]
*  and encourage some actually good legislation moving forward. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3712.36s)]
*  Do you plan to conduct investigations from your perch on the Oversight Committee of ICE and DHS? [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3714.92s)]
*  And do you think that any of these officials would actually show up at the hearings? [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3722.52s)]
*  One is absolutely you can take it to the bank. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3727.0s)]
*  I mean, going after the corruption of what's happening right now in ICE and Homeland Security [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3729.16s)]
*  is going to be a critical piece of our oversight agenda. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3734.6s)]
*  Even in a minority, we actually have some oversight investigative work coming up here [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3737.96s)]
*  in the next few weeks specific to ICE. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3742.04s)]
*  But certainly that is going to be a big focus of what we do. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3744.7599999999998s)]
*  Broadly speaking, of course, when we're able to have subpoena power and actually take over [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3748.2799999999997s)]
*  the investigations, one thing I've told people is you can rest assured that if you are right [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3751.72s)]
*  now causing the level of harm that the Stephen Millers of the world are, that these ICE agents [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3757.0s)]
*  are, the corruption that's happening to destroy our institutions, you are going to be held [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3761.88s)]
*  accountable. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3766.04s)]
*  We're not going to forget the harm that you're causing to people and our government. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3766.76s)]
*  We're going to use the power of subpoena investigations. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3772.36s)]
*  We're going to ensure transparency and these folks are going to be held accountable. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3776.6000000000004s)]
*  I know you've been working really hard to get answers from the administration on [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3780.44s)]
*  Andres Romero Hernandez, the Venezuelan asylum seeker, who they've disappeared to see caught. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3784.1200000000003s)]
*  And I know you were talking about this with with Lovett and Tim Miller at the [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3790.28s)]
*  at the Pride event a couple of weeks ago. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3795.32s)]
*  Any other updates you've gotten on Andres? [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3799.0s)]
*  No, I'm hopeful that we'll get an update soon. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3802.6800000000003s)]
*  There is a lot happening right now with the case. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3807.48s)]
*  I were in very close contact with the lawyers and the family. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3809.88s)]
*  And I will tell you that some of the most compassionate, smart people are working on [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3814.2000000000003s)]
*  this case right now. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3819.2400000000002s)]
*  And I remind everyone that Andres came to our country seeking asylum with an appointment [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3821.0s)]
*  that we gave him. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3827.96s)]
*  We said, come to this appointment on this day and this time. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3830.2799999999997s)]
*  And then we detain him and then send him to a country he's never been to, to a notorious [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3834.44s)]
*  prison. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3839.56s)]
*  And as you know, someone that's described as very sweet by his family. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3840.3599999999997s)]
*  And so just horrific, the cruelty level. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3844.04s)]
*  We are, of course, in the courts right now on this case. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3847.88s)]
*  There is some movement. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3851.56s)]
*  I'm really hoping that the proof of life piece, which is so critical, we're hoping to get [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3852.92s)]
*  that some proof of life here soon. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3858.44s)]
*  And I'm hoping there'll be some some positive developments, which I'm hoping that will be [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3860.6s)]
*  announced. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3865.48s)]
*  That would be wonderful. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3865.7200000000003s)]
*  Republicans in Congress right now are still trying to get the votes for their bill to [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3866.6s)]
*  cut taxes for the rich and health care for the rest. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3869.8s)]
*  Do you think any of your Republican colleagues in the House will actually defy Donald Trump [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3872.6s)]
*  and vote against this bill? [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3879.0s)]
*  And what do Democrats have planned to make noise about this as we get closer to a final [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3880.2000000000003s)]
*  vote? [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3885.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, first, I can't believe that they're doing this. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3886.6s)]
*  This is literally insane. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3889.6400000000003s)]
*  The amount of people are going to lose health care. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3891.96s)]
*  I mean, millions, 16 million people could lose health care and food assistance. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3894.12s)]
*  It's just it has nothing to do with anything that Donald Trump or Republicans actually [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3898.36s)]
*  campaign on. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3902.84s)]
*  What happened to lowering the costs of groceries and the cost of goods? [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3903.56s)]
*  And if you think about our state alone, right in California, the Republican Californians [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3907.56s)]
*  could actually stop this bill, but they are just complete cowards and just bend the knee [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3912.92s)]
*  to whatever Donald Trump wants. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3918.2799999999997s)]
*  These supposedly moderate members, which are not moderate, they're extremists, are not [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3919.8s)]
*  standing up to Speaker Johnson and the president. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3925.32s)]
*  Take David Valedale. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3928.44s)]
*  David Valedale has more people on Medicaid. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3930.04s)]
*  We call it Medi-Cal here in California, more people on Medicaid than any other member of [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3934.04s)]
*  Congress in the state of California. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3939.4s)]
*  His population of constituents depend on Medicare for their health care, for their [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3943.0800000000004s)]
*  livelihood to live. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3949.2400000000002s)]
*  And yet he's going to vote to cut that care. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3950.92s)]
*  Young Kim here in Southern California likes to talk a good game. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3954.36s)]
*  She's all in the tank for cutting health care from workers and teachers in her district. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3958.52s)]
*  And so we're starting by holding these California Republicans accountable. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3963.6400000000003s)]
*  And there are other Republicans across the country who are now very nervous about the [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3968.04s)]
*  progress of this bill in the Senate. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3972.04s)]
*  I hope that there's some senators that will do the right thing, but we can stop this if [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3973.7200000000003s)]
*  we just had a handful of Republicans who didn't believe in cutting health care for our [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3978.04s)]
*  grandparents. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3982.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3983.32s)]
*  I want to read you some reactions to Zoran Mondani's winning the Democratic primary for [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3984.76s)]
*  mayor of New York. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3990.28s)]
*  Absolute wrong choice for New York. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3992.1200000000003s)]
*  Serious concerns, profoundly alarmed, deeply disturbing pattern of unacceptable, anti-Semitic [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3994.04s)]
*  comments. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=3999.8s)]
*  Those are all from Democrats, many of them your House colleagues. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4000.6000000000004s)]
*  I know you've praised Mondani's win and said Democrats need to get on board. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4004.04s)]
*  What would you say in response to your colleagues' concerns? [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4008.92s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4012.6800000000003s)]
*  Anyone that has followed this campaign or that has seen the way it's connected with [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4013.96s)]
*  voters and New Yorkers can see that this is someone that we should be taking lessons from. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4018.52s)]
*  Let's be first clear. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4025.1600000000003s)]
*  He is a Democratic nominee for mayor in New York. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4026.52s)]
*  And that's if you are a Democrat and you believe in building our party, he is our nominee. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4029.5600000000004s)]
*  And I expect that we are going to be on board, not just at the national level, but across [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4035.0s)]
*  the country and certainly in New York. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4039.1600000000003s)]
*  The second thing is there's a lot of, I think, rhetoric about why he won and people want [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4041.16s)]
*  to attribute foreign policy issues or what's happening in the Middle East or other things. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4046.8399999999997s)]
*  From the DSR, he's a socialist. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4053.56s)]
*  I think that is actually not the centerpiece of why he won. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4055.64s)]
*  He won because he actually had a forward-looking agenda. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4059.48s)]
*  He had an agenda that was positive, that people felt. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4062.52s)]
*  He's talking about lowering the cost of living. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4067.72s)]
*  Buses and transit, that's free. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4070.7599999999998s)]
*  Rent stabilization for New Yorkers across all the boroughs. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4073.24s)]
*  These are widely popular issues with people. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4076.6s)]
*  And the people are saying, yes, we think those should be Democratic priorities. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4079.48s)]
*  So we should be listening to the people on the ground that powered this election. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4084.6s)]
*  And then he took those ideas, a forward-looking agenda, and matched it with some of the best [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4089.16s)]
*  political retail skills and communication skills that we've seen in modern campaigning. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4094.8399999999997s)]
*  His digital program, what he was communicating online was insane. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4099.96s)]
*  Every time I saw something different in the way he communicated with people, [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4107.0s)]
*  and I told folks here in DC, are you guys seeing this? [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4110.12s)]
*  We're going around spending $10, $20 million, spending on consultants to figure out how we [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4115.08s)]
*  reach voters. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4121.88s)]
*  I'm like, can we just listen and watch what this guy is doing? [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4122.92s)]
*  Look, you don't have to agree with all of his positions. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4127.64s)]
*  And many folks are going to have different positions than Zoran has, whether it's on foreign [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4130.84s)]
*  policy issues or on economic issues. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4136.04s)]
*  But he is our nominee. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4138.68s)]
*  He speaks to New Yorkers. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4140.6s)]
*  We should get behind him, and we should learn from what he's doing in this campaign. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4142.2s)]
*  Last question on this, and then I'll let you go. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4146.2s)]
*  He certainly expanded the coalition. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4148.04s)]
*  He brought in new voters. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4150.92s)]
*  I think he did better with some working and middle-class voters than people expected. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4152.44s)]
*  He still lost to Cuomo by 20 points among people making under $50,000. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4156.84s)]
*  He lost black voters by 20 points. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4161.72s)]
*  And this is obviously not a mumdani thing. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4163.8s)]
*  This has been a pattern for Democrats stretching back to the 2024 election and even earlier [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4165.88s)]
*  than that. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4170.5199999999995s)]
*  But my thought is, OK, here's someone who has populist, progressive economic policies [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4171.4s)]
*  that were the focus of his campaign. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4178.28s)]
*  He's a fantastic communicator. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4180.04s)]
*  He's a really skilled politician. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4181.72s)]
*  He got to go meet tons and tons of voters. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4183.48s)]
*  If that can't win over working-class voters, where are your thoughts on what Democrats [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4186.92s)]
*  should do in both the midterms and beyond to win over some of these working-class voters [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4194.84s)]
*  who either used to vote Democrat or would certainly benefit from Democratic policies? [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4201.08s)]
*  I have this conversation all the time with my colleagues here in Congress and friends. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4206.92s)]
*  I think there's two pieces. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4212.599999999999s)]
*  I think one is, look, he did overperform in some of those margins. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4213.72s)]
*  And when you look at some of the black and brown voters in New York, he actually looked [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4218.52s)]
*  at the Latino vote. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4221.88s)]
*  He did better than expected. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4222.92s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4224.68s)]
*  Grateful to that. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4225.400000000001s)]
*  And he made the effort, right, which is really important. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4226.360000000001s)]
*  The thing about the left, and I think something we've all got to grapple with, is yes, [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4229.72s)]
*  class issues and working-class issues are key and central and are so important and [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4234.76s)]
*  should be driving policy. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4239.96s)]
*  But also, black and brown voters, especially within the black community that are the bedrock [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4241.56s)]
*  of our party and our voter, issues of racial justice, of racial injustice, and of race [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4246.52s)]
*  are central and are important. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4253.64s)]
*  And to leave some of that conversation off the table, I think is a huge mistake for [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4256.04s)]
*  progressives and folks on the left. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4261.240000000001s)]
*  And so I think we have to have an honest conversation, kind of both sides of the family, [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4262.84s)]
*  about both are important. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4268.280000000001s)]
*  And a lot of the folks that I talk to, Latinos, working-class Latinos, they feel the system [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4270.44s)]
*  is broken, but they also want the racial injustice to be recognized as part of that broader [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4274.919999999999s)]
*  conversation. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4282.04s)]
*  So there's a lot of work to do there. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4282.599999999999s)]
*  We've got some talented people talking about this. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4284.5199999999995s)]
*  I think whether it's Zoran or others across this country, we've got to bring all of this [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4287.32s)]
*  together and talk about this divide. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4291.799999999999s)]
*  It is real, and it's going to be a challenge for us moving forward to win elections. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4293.799999999999s)]
*  Congressman Garcia, great talking to you. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4297.5599999999995s)]
*  Thanks for joining and come back again soon. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4299.639999999999s)]

*  That's our show for today. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4304.599999999999s)]
*  Dan's going to be back on Sunday with a conversation with epidemiologist, [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4305.5599999999995s)]
*  Kaitlyn Jettelina, to talk about RFK Jr. and the threat he presents to science and public [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4309.16s)]
*  health. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4313.5599999999995s)]
*  Dan, are you maja curious now? [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4313.96s)]
*  No, I'm not maja curious. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4316.599999999999s)]
*  I am quite concerned about what they're doing to our vaccines. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4317.72s)]
*  But I do want to talk to Kaitlyn about, because she has actually met with some of [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4322.92s)]
*  the leaders in the maja movement, about what it is who brought them, in many cases from [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4327.0s)]
*  our side, to the MAGA movement and how we get them back. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4331.08s)]
*  I can't wait to listen to that. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4335.24s)]
*  All right, everyone have a great weekend and we'll talk to you soon. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4336.68s)]
*  Bye, everyone. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvJdTae_35A&t=4339.56s)]
