Video Description: Donald Trump spends 40 minutes at a Pennsylvania Q&A queueing up his favorite tunes, baffling the crowd (and everyone else). Tommy and Democratic strategist Rebecca Katz talk through whether Trump is, in fact, losing it, the key moments from his Fox News town hall on women's issues, and Kamala Harris's sit-down with Charlamagne Tha God. Then, Rebecca walks Tommy through the situation on the ground in Pennsylvania, Arizona, and some under-the-radar House races.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Trump Freezes And Has A Bizarre Episode At Town Hall + Kamala Harris Does Charlemagne Interview
**Pod Save America:** [October 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw)
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Tommy Vitor and I'm Rebecca Katz. Rebecca, it's great to see you my old friend [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=0.0s)]
*  And the brilliant Democratic strategist behind many [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=6.84s)]
*  Huge Democratic wins over the last few years. It's great to see you great to be here. So for the listeners [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=10.32s)]
*  Rebecca and I go way back. We work together on John Edwards for president 2004 [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  How about that the good campaign, right? That's how I go [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=22.44s)]
*  It was very helpful. We were very it was a it was a fun time. It was a very fun time [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=25.64s)]
*  It was a great team. We were like the little engine that could campaign that took this [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=30.36s)]
*  totally unknown and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=35.0s)]
*  arguably unqualified senator [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=36.64s)]
*  From you know senator to the VP nominee [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=39.04s)]
*  And I don't know the two Americas message from that campaign people should be studying [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=42.84s)]
*  That because it was it was very good. You even saw John Edwards at the DNC, right? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=47.64s)]
*  Yes, John Edwards was at the DNC, you know, they invite all the former nominees and he had been a VP nominee in [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=53.16s)]
*  2004 so he came back as a guest and he just had a happy hour for former staffers [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=60.36s)]
*  That's very nice. I like that. Look obviously the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=66.28s)]
*  History is complicated. We don't need to relitigate it here [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=70.12s)]
*  It is just interesting in like political life who is given sort of absolution for mistakes and failings and who isn't [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=72.72s)]
*  And I'm surprised he's sort of still on the isn't list. Yeah, I think I think he's due for a rehabilitation tour [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=80.80000000000001s)]
*  I mean he did it was he's a flawed man [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=87.16000000000001s)]
*  But I think he was was vilified and kind of served his time in public opinion there [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=90.08000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he definitely um, he definitely was widely criticized. But thank you for doing the show Rebecca. We have a lot to talk about today [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=95.48s)]
*  I just want to do like let's do a little vibe check. How are you feeling? It's a couple weeks out [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=102.52000000000001s)]
*  I'm getting a million texts from people telling me how nervous they are. How are you? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=106.68s)]
*  I am cautiously optimistic. I will say October always feels terrible for Democrats. We just have to remember that right August [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=110.56s)]
*  We feel great. We feel like we're gonna win everything [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=117.80000000000001s)]
*  It's gonna be amazing and then October hits and like we all just kind of feel nauseous and this like heavy weight [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=119.88000000000001s)]
*  we're carrying the whole month of just this dread and I will say just like [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  You know, obviously we have a every reason to be worried, but we shouldn't let it be paralyzing fear [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=131.76s)]
*  That's right. Yeah, it's the stakes couldn't be higher. Let's just be honest about that. It's super close [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=139.4s)]
*  I know some people kind of in the political world that are looking at polling that are increasingly nervous [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=145.36s)]
*  You're hearing people talk about concern that Trump is outspending Kamala Harris in some [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=152.0s)]
*  TV markets she was slightly out of the news [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=157.6s)]
*  I think for a couple weeks because of the hurricanes and obviously like the messaging and response about FEMA [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=160.36s)]
*  Is gonna come from the White House, but I think like since then she's been hitting the gas [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=166.96s)]
*  She's doing all these interviews in town halls and events that we'll talk about [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=171.4s)]
*  But it's tied and it will be tied until Election Day and I just think for all the nervous texters [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=174.72000000000003s)]
*  Just remember you have agency [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=180.96s)]
*  You know [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=183.44s)]
*  It's October 16th if you want to donate if you want to knock doors if you want to go to vote safe America calm to find [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=184.04000000000002s)]
*  opportunities you have time but like [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  Do not refresh the 538 polling average every day from now until Election Day [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=193.61999999999998s)]
*  No, that's that's no good for anybody and this there's a burden here for the third time in the last eight years [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=198.42s)]
*  This is the most important election of our lifetime, right? That is exhausting. Like we have real fatigue [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=204.66s)]
*  It's tiring, but there's still there's still a lot we can do and we shouldn't feel like we're just sitting there [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=211.61999999999998s)]
*  Just biting our fingernails. Yeah, go do something. Do not tweet that you think she's gonna lose [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=217.92s)]
*  You can quote tweet yourself in November because you do that. I will hate you forever. Okay on today's show [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=222.78s)]
*  Oh, we have Kamala Harris [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=229.22s)]
*  We got trying to reach black voters in a tough town hall style interview with Charlemagne the god in Detroit [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=231.22s)]
*  Donald Trump goes after [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=236.62s)]
*  Women voters in a Fox News town hall with this all-female audience. This was not a tough interview [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=238.58s)]
*  This was a bunch of softballs. I suspect he'd get harder questions from his family and own staff [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=244.42000000000002s)]
*  We'll also talk about the state of the race in key states like Pennsylvania and Arizona we'll talk about how [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=249.18s)]
*  Some things are going in these like red and purple housed races and why they are defying the trend lines that we're seeing [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=255.74s)]
*  Nationally, but first and Rebecca this is not breaking news [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=264.06s)]
*  But we on this show have not yet had the chance to talk about [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=267.5s)]
*  Trump's bizarre Monday night event in Oaks, Pennsylvania this Philly suburb where we were treated to [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=271.18s)]
*  I don't know. Maybe the most bizarre Trump event of an already weird cycle and think about that bar for a second [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=277.38s)]
*  Yeah, it's like so I think it was supposed to be a town hall QA format taking questions to the audience [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=287.97999999999996s)]
*  But then someone in the crowd needed medical attention [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=293.58s)]
*  The crowd starts chanting or singing god bless America and Trump [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=295.65999999999997s)]
*  Basically called in his DJ to play Ave Maria then someone else needed medical attention things took a turn. Here's a clip [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=300.18s)]
*  Do any more questions? This is listen to music. Let's make it into a music [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=307.18s)]
*  Who the hell wants to hear questions, right? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=312.5s)]
*  It's gonna be I want this to be a really important evening and those two people that went down are patrons and we love them [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=315.85999999999996s)]
*  Yes, because of them we ended up with some good music, right, right? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=323.58s)]
*  So play YMCA go ahead. Let's go nice and loud [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=328.26s)]
*  Nobody's leaving what's going there's nobody leaving [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=331.58s)]
*  Keep going keep going. Should we keep going? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=336.46s)]
*  I turn that music up turn it up. So this goes on for like 40 minutes literally [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=343.09999999999997s)]
*  40 minutes is a long time. It's a long time to be standing. Yes [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=348.86s)]
*  They're doing nothing swaying on the stage awkwardly. Let me let me read you a little bit of the music [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=353.58s)]
*  Doing nothing swaying on the stage awkwardly. Let me let me read you the set list real quick Ave Maria time to say goodbye [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=358.3s)]
*  It's a man's man's man's world YMCA. Hallelujah. Nothing compares to you an american trilogy rich men north of rich men november rain [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=364.7s)]
*  In memory from cats people started walking out south dakota governor and puppy killer christy gnome kind of didn't seem [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=372.7s)]
*  To know what to do. I don't rebecca what what track got you going? Which which got you amped? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=379.98s)]

*  Like what kind of psychopath has this set list? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=392.7s)]
*  it doesn't even make sense and I just [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=396.86s)]
*  I don't know. I felt like it was [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=400.46s)]
*  For for reporters to comment that a trump rally is strange [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=403.58s)]
*  You have to take it so far, right? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=407.5s)]
*  And for him to you know a town hall when you do a town hall event [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=410.14s)]
*  You want to take questions? Like what are people thinking? You know, here he is in suburban philadelphia [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=413.90000000000003s)]
*  the most probably the most important media market he can be in in all of the swing states and he is [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=419.18s)]
*  Losing his mind a little bit, right and he is [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=426.46000000000004s)]
*  Smiling and he doesn't usually smile. So like that that [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=430.92s)]
*  Caused me some like is what what is his new like regiment like i'll have what he's having, you know what I mean? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=435.41999999999996s)]
*  Because he was just like happy and then he was doing his like little dance and there's christy. Noam. Just kind of standing there [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=441.58s)]
*  Not really knowing what to do and she has to be the same person [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=449.26s)]
*  Right. It was kind of wild. Yeah, I mean you and I have been staffers for a long time [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=453.9s)]
*  We've both been at events where you are kind of like on your phone half paying attention [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=458.61999999999995s)]
*  Then you hear your boss give a bad answer and you're like, oh god. Oh god [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=462.94s)]
*  What are we going to do or like something kind of goes south in an event someone protests something bad happens [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=466.78s)]
*  Imagine being the staffer in the back and it's like minute 23 and you're like, how do we get the boss to stop? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=472.3s)]
*  DJing this event. I heard that they were like trying to tell him on the teleprompter like you can now answer questions [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=477.9s)]
*  You can now and you know, and he just wasn't just not feeling those cues. He was just like [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=483.1s)]
*  Like wanting to dance and there's nobody who can save him when he's going out that far [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=487.74s)]
*  Um, and you know, we say a lot that trump doesn't get real scrutiny [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=494.3s)]
*  Like he says crazy stuff and he doesn't do it. This was the first time that I think reporters really [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=498.06s)]
*  Took the beat to say like something seems wrong. Yeah, and I just i'm just gonna say it [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=504.06s)]
*  you know [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=509.74s)]
*  When you get old you get old fast [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=511.02s)]
*  And I do think he is much worse in this month of october than he was even a few months ago [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=513.9s)]
*  Yeah, and we've seen this, you know, like I remember we all saw the state of the union with biden in january [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=519.8199999999999s)]
*  We're like we're gonna be great and then the debate happened. We're like, okay, maybe we're not so great [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=524.78s)]
*  Like there is something that is going on with trump [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=528.8599999999999s)]
*  that seems [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=532.6999999999999s)]
*  Pretty bad. Yeah, let's let's let's dig in on this a bit because even before the musical interlude [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=534.14s)]
*  Trump did some q a and even those were weird. So uh, philip bump at the washington post [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=540.4599999999999s)]
*  Printed in full one of trump's answers to a very straightforward audience question about bringing down grocery prices [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=545.26s)]
*  I'm going to read the beginning of it [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=550.14s)]
*  Uh, so, you know, it's such a great question in the sense that people don't think of grocery [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=551.9799999999999s)]
*  You know, it sounds like not much an important word when you talk about homes and everything else, right? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=555.66s)]
*  But more people tell me about grocery bills where the price of bacon the price of lettuce the price of tomatoes [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=559.9s)]
*  They tell me and we're going to do with a lot of things [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=563.9s)]
*  You know our farmers aren't being treated properly and we had a deal with china and it was a great deal [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=566.46s)]
*  I never mentioned it because once covet came I said that was a bridge too far because I had a great relationship with [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=570.62s)]
*  President xi and here's a fierce man and he's a man that likes china and I understand that but we had a deal and he [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=575.9s)]
*  Was perfect on that deal 50 billion. He was going to buy we were doing numbers like you wouldn't believe for the farmer [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=581.02s)]
*  That goes on for another 800 words rebecca. Uh, they mentioned the border control [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=586.54s)]
*  Yeah [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=591.04s)]
*  It's like the meat [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=593.28s)]
*  Sure sure grandpa [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=594.96s)]
*  So it reminds me of when I was a kid when one of my grandparents would tell me to go to the bar to get him [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=596.16s)]
*  Another drink and my dad would intercept me on the way back and fill it up with water. That's what that reminds me [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=601.2s)]
*  Something is very wrong there. There's not one like fully cognizant answer like, you know, like he doesn't [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=606.64s)]
*  He is not speaking in regular english anymore [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=614.16s)]
*  It is just like it is a whirlwind of like what's going on in his head [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=617.84s)]
*  This man should not be in charge of anything right now [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=622.0s)]
*  Yeah, and the clearly this is why kamala harris is telling voters to watch trump's rallies [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=624.88s)]
*  I think she sincerely means it. It's not just a line. It's also why kamala harris is playing videos [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=628.72s)]
*  Of trump at her rallies now. I think they played a clip of some of his recent answers to maria barteromo [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=633.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I think like if the challenge is, you know democrats will watch this and be like this guy's losing his mind [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=638.8s)]
*  Republicans will just see it through a partisan lens and decide that you know, it's funny or charming [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=643.92s)]
*  I guess the question is whether undecideds will ever see this [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=648.64s)]
*  It's hard to sum it up in like a concise way [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=652.08s)]
*  Like how do you make us to we struggle to make a supercut of a 38 minute event [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=654.3199999999999s)]
*  But but I mean rebecca [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=658.24s)]
*  Do you think this is a message that the harris folks can or should try to introduce? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=660.24s)]
*  Kind of in these closing weeks. Is this part of a closing argument? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=664.56s)]
*  I mean I do like at the end of the day [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=667.28s)]
*  People need to know that the person in charge of this country is like fighting for them and has their best interest in like at the very least [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=669.84s)]
*  like understands what is going on in the world and he [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=677.12s)]
*  He seems very far away from reality at the moment and I think it's important for them to remind people that [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=681.84s)]
*  She has a plan. She can articulate the plan. She understands the plan. She's knowledgeable like he can't articulate [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=688.48s)]
*  An answer to anything when's the last time he just had like a regular answer to a question [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=694.32s)]
*  Yeah, and he's like he's actually branded his incoherence to the weave and he thinks it's an asset [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=699.7600000000001s)]
*  He's like, oh I say all this random shit and I string it together at the end [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=704.24s)]
*  It's like I know you don't pal you just that's called rambling. Um, he also did a q a on tuesday though at the economic club [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=706.8000000000001s)]
*  Of chicago where he got you know an hour's worth of economic questions. Here was one about google and antitrust [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=712.5600000000001s)]
*  Here's the answer should google be broken up [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=719.84s)]
*  I just haven't gotten over something the justice department did yesterday where [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=724.48s)]
*  Virginia cleaned up its voter rolls and got rid of thousands and thousands of bad votes [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=732.5600000000001s)]
*  And the justice department sued them that they should be allowed to put those bad votes and illegal votes back in [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=738.32s)]
*  And let the people vote [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=745.36s)]
*  So I haven't I haven't gotten I haven't gotten over that a lot of people have seen that they can't even believe it [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=746.96s)]
*  The question is about google president trump [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=752.48s)]
*  I love that question was about google. I mean he can't he can't answer a question to the extent that you're wondering like is he [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=754.96s)]
*  Processing what is being asked of him? Like is his brain processing it? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=763.5s)]
*  Yeah, or like does he not know what google is like which one is it? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=768.24s)]
*  You know, I don't know. I have no idea [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=772.72s)]
*  He knows what twitter is, you know, yeah, he loves twitter. He loves elon [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=774.72s)]
*  Um, yeah, the other the other sort of piece of evidence here rebecca is like trump had an interview scheduled [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=777.6800000000001s)]
*  I guess on cnbc with this guy joe kernan who might as well be a trump surrogate or family member [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=782.24s)]
*  He's like that kind of in the tank and insufferable [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=787.0400000000001s)]
*  And that was a weird flag [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=789.84s)]
*  But then I watched this whole event and it was with this guy john mcclathwaite the editor in chief of bloomberg [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=791.0400000000001s)]
*  Who was formerly the editor of the economist and it was a tough? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=796.48s)]
*  contentious interview and I actually thought that format kind of served trump well because [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=800.78s)]
*  Um that answer we just heard was incoherent [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=807.3599999999999s)]
*  But they had stacked the audience with supporters and mcclathwaite kind of interrupted enough to prevent the weave from happening and preventing him [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=809.52s)]
*  From getting too incoherent and also look if we're being honest john mcclathwaite [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=816.3199999999999s)]
*  With kind of the perfect foil for trump because I bet a lot of the clips the trump people will put out is [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=820.7199999999999s)]
*  are of him [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=827.12s)]
*  berating this kind of pompous seeming [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=828.4799999999999s)]
*  British guy about why he was wrong about tariffs and boy, you know, I bet that plays well in like pittsburgh. I don't know [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=831.28s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I just think he's he's he's picking a lot of fights. I look his [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=839.68s)]
*  His reliance on the word tariffs in that interview was seemed a little bit troubling as well. Like he just didn't [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=844.8s)]
*  It's like he just learned the word or something. Like it was just a weird way that he [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=851.3599999999999s)]
*  He was talking. I think he likes to fight with everyone who's interviewing him now [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=855.1999999999999s)]
*  And I think he likes to have the crowd cheering him on it's like wherever he goes [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=859.5200000000001s)]
*  He just has a crowd that is cheering for him because that is [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=863.6800000000001s)]
*  What he likes. Yeah, he loves it. I don't know. I mean [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=867.6800000000001s)]
*  I think it's interesting that he's not doing more interviews. Like he he doesn't seem to be [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=870.48s)]
*  Talking beyond just a very specific base. Yeah, it's a fox news safe space [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=875.5200000000001s)]
*  That's how I do think the the the headline that came out of the economic club interview was him once again ducking questions about [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=879.7600000000001s)]
*  the peaceful transition of power which [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=885.6800000000001s)]
*  Uh ain't good and he refused to comment on whether he talked to putin since he left office [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=887.8399999999999s)]

*  I think actually they taped it yesterday, but it aired this morning on women's issues [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1079.4399999999998s)]
*  Uh moderated by harris fochner, uh fox anchor [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1083.68s)]
*  Um, let's play a couple clips. Um, the first is [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1088.3999999999999s)]
*  Uh trump and harris fochner talking about a georgia woman named amber thurman [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1092.08s)]
*  Amber thurman's family have come out on a press call and they're doing what's called a prebuttal to our town hall right now [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1096.0s)]
*  That's nice. Yeah, and I want to get better ratings. I promise [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1103.28s)]
*  So just some context for the listeners here amber thurman is a georgia woman who died after being denied an emergency abortion for 20 hours [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1108.48s)]
*  Um, some members of her family did a call with the harris campaign to talk about her story [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1116.48s)]
*  In the stakes for women in terms of abortion access in this election. Um, rebecca that answer we heard [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1121.2s)]
*  Is is them laughing? I mean, it's so [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1127.92s)]
*  How I mean, this is a woman who died it's [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1130.48s)]
*  Who who literally like bled out and they're laughing about it and talking about ratings like he [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1133.0400000000002s)]
*  First of all, let me just take a step back. He said he's had this women's forum, right? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1138.88s)]
*  He spent how long was it 50 minutes of the of the 60 to get to the question of abortion, right? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1144.0s)]
*  Like that is not a woman's forum [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1150.0800000000002s)]
*  This is he was had women in the audience and he was talking to the same people he always talks to on fox news [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1152.24s)]
*  Let's just get that out of the way [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1157.2s)]
*  But the way that he sees everything is about ratings and laughing about women dying like this is [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1158.64s)]
*  This is why he's losing women voters at such record numbers [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1164.0800000000002s)]
*  and like another thing like [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1167.68s)]
*  he's [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1169.92s)]
*  For him to say he's going to do this women's forum [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1171.3600000000001s)]
*  It's like he would do anything rather than debate kamala harris, right? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1173.6000000000001s)]
*  like he is so afraid of her about the way that she like but like just [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1177.76s)]
*  Destroyed him at the last debate that he is avoiding that he's trying to show that he's talking to all these people [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1182.96s)]
*  But he's he's talking to the same people you go to trump rallies [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1187.6s)]
*  They look very similar from state to state you go to a harris rally like whether she's in [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1191.52s)]
*  Bucks county, pennsylvania or eerie pennsylvania very different like audiences very, you know, and she's in georgia [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1197.12s)]
*  Everywhere she goes her audience is different [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1203.12s)]
*  Trump is speaking to a lot of the same people and he has not expanded his base [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1206.32s)]
*  Yeah, this is just kind of like branding that it was a women's rally didn't seem like it actually focused on the issues as you noted [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1210.72s)]
*  They just had women there. Yeah, who just they're sort of who that asked very friendly questions [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1216.24s)]
*  One of the more bizarre claims of this this event was about ivf. Let's listen to that [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1221.04s)]
*  All right, let's get this question. Yeah, because I believe that's what this is about. Oh, I want to talk about ivf [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1226.48s)]
*  I'm the father you don't hear that every day. I'm the father of ivf. So I want to hear this question [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1232.56s)]
*  Again for context ivf became available in 1978 [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1237.84s)]
*  Um, it's been widely available for decades the biggest impediment to getting ivf has been the cost of ivf. It's very expensive [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1241.94s)]
*  um that all but you know the the next biggest threat to ivf has been the overturning of roe versus wade by [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1249.3s)]
*  trump judges [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1256.5s)]
*  Um, it was highlighted when you know, alabama moved to ban ivf republicans freaked out in that moment [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1257.8600000000001s)]
*  They've tried to cover their political flank on this issue trump is proposed giving out free ivf treatments to everybody in america [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1264.18s)]
*  But when democrats try to pass bills guaranteeing access to ivf nationwide republicans block it over and over and over again in congress [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1271.3s)]
*  Um rebecca democrats were very focused on ivf for a while that focus seems to have faded a bit [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1279.46s)]
*  How much do you think that should be a part of the abortion messaging in this closing stretch? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1286.26s)]
*  Okay, let me just take a step back. I am not convinced that trump knows what ivf is [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1291.06s)]
*  I just want to be really clear like you listen to him talk about ivf and I do not think he knows what it is [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1295.86s)]
*  Okay, so there's that [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1302.6599999999999s)]
*  Um, and you know in arizona, we had carrie lake who spent a good part of the debate talking about uvf [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1305.3799999999999s)]
*  You know, so it's it's very hard to say what republicans are understanding with [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1311.3s)]
*  republican political leaders and [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1315.94s)]
*  ivf I will say that democrats like they have talked about it and they will fight for it and like they will protect [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1318.02s)]
*  Women's ability to have families or or any anybody to have families. You know what I mean? It's just it is [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1324.1000000000001s)]
*  It is so strange to me that [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1330.98s)]
*  That these that the trump supreme court like where he one third of that court is those are his judges [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1333.7s)]
*  Um that they are going farther and farther and he's trying to distance himself from the same judges [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1340.42s)]
*  He put on there [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1344.82s)]
*  You know whether it's talking about abortion going to the states. We don't want abortion to go to states [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1346.1000000000001s)]
*  We wanted row his judges overturned it right and that's something like the the intensity of women voters right now [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1349.78s)]
*  I think it's because [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1356.42s)]
*  they understand [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1357.8600000000001s)]
*  What's at stake and to your point? [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1359.7s)]
*  I think in that interview he says he basically learned about ivf or the crisis in ivf because he got a call from [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1361.46s)]
*  Katie brit senator in alabama who gave that bizarre state of the union response that we all remember [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1368.26s)]
*  In his conversation, but in his comments about katie brit. I think he called her attractive [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1374.26s)]
*  It was like very the whole thing was just very weird and gross and very trump [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1377.46s)]
*  It's like he knew the initials, but he didn't actually know what happened, right? Right? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1381.3000000000002s)]
*  He knows he's mad about it and he knows he's losing voters on that issue. Yeah [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1386.18s)]
*  So like oh, it's free for everybody now. Okay. Um, of course though, you know, no women you get ivf and you get ivf [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1390.74s)]
*  Yeah, it's like oprah in the car. Uh, no women's town hall will be complete with a little uh a little light fascism [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1396.66s)]
*  Um here is trump once again talking about his enemies president kamala [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1402.1000000000001s)]
*  harris has said you sounded unhinged and unchecked power is in our future what what what do you say? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1406.66s)]
*  It was a nice presentation [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1412.9s)]
*  I wasn't I wasn't unhinged. You know, you know what they are. They're a party of sound bites there [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1415.46s)]
*  Somebody asked me can they be brought together? You know, it's very I never thought really I wasn't thinking like they could because they are [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1422.42s)]
*  They're very different [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1430.02s)]
*  And it is the enemy from within and they're very dangerous they're marxists and communists and fascists and they're sick [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1432.1s)]
*  I use a guy like adam schiff because they made up the russia russia russia hooks. It took two years to solve the problem [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1439.46s)]
*  Absolutely. Nothing was done wrong. Et cetera. Et cetera. They're dangerous for our country. We have so rebecca [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1446.24s)]
*  We talked about um trump's kind of heightened accelerationist rhetoric on the show on tuesday [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1451.54s)]
*  I do think it's worth being even more clear today that [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1456.98s)]
*  Talking about the enemy within is text book [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1459.94s)]
*  Fascist rhetoric. This is stuff you heard from hitler talking about jews and communists, etc [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1463.5400000000002s)]
*  Heard from musolini heard from franco, but the question I always have is when you make that point or or [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1469.0600000000002s)]
*  Tell that to people does it sound so extreme that people think you're hyperbolic and tune you out? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1476.74s)]
*  Like what do you think you do with a clip like that? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1482.42s)]
*  I mean obviously it's it's chilling to hear him talk like that, but I I do think that [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1485.7s)]
*  That the messaging argument against him on this has been challenging, right? [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1492.34s)]
*  People think he's a clown. They think he's funny. They don't see how scary he is and the more [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1497.78s)]
*  That other people start saying know your history like learn these dog whistles. It's [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1503.14s)]
*  It's not resonating it's like we're all talking to ourselves and and a whole other segment of the population just does not believe it [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1508.98s)]
*  even if it's [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1516.58s)]
*  Right there and true and it's it's sad, but I I don't [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1517.78s)]
*  I don't think it's registering with a lot of folks. I don't either and it's not just this clip [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1522.4199999999998s)]
*  It's not just this commentary about the enemy within it's not just like the obvious rage at the various court cases against him [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1527.1399999999999s)]
*  or his [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1534.58s)]
*  Suggestions that democrats were behind the assassination attempts like if you watch his truth social feed [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1535.92s)]
*  I mean the other day he posted something in the middle of the night where he said that [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1541.04s)]
*  Kamala Harris's [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1545.04s)]
*  Medical report about seasonal allergies were a dangerous situation [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1546.48s)]
*  You know, he's talking about revoking cbs's broadcast rights because he's mad at 60 minutes for editing a clip [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1550.0s)]
*  um, and his supporters are now like this this is the other thing that happens in october is [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1556.88s)]
*  It's the nastiest part of every campaign [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1561.92s)]
*  I mean [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1563.68s)]
*  There's a non-profit now called building america's future funded in part by elon musk that is funding a bunch of super PACs doing dirty [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1563.92s)]
*  Shit one of them is sending mailers highlighting kamala harris's marriage to doug emhoff [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1570.32s)]
*  Who is jewish his work combating anti-semitism his support for israel and they're sending that to muslim and arab-american voters [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1575.76s)]
*  Um trying to drive them away from her the same super back [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1583.04s)]
*  I believe is sending pro israel and jewish voters mailers saying she's too pro-palestinian [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1586.24s)]
*  So this is just like the most cynical dishonest and nasty part of the whole thing [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1591.52s)]
*  They're they're trying to win by making everyone hate each other. That is their recipe, right? Like [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1596.24s)]
*  Harris is out there talking about what brings us together and you know bringing back hope and joy [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1602.48s)]
*  and um [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1607.92s)]
*  There is there is no hope and joy on the trump campaign [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1609.6s)]
*  Like they want you to hate everyone [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1613.2s)]
*  They want you to be so pissed off at the whole world and they want you to hate everyone who doesn't look like you [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1615.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and it's all being funded by some of the richest people in the world. I think politico [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1620.64s)]
*  Had some data from the the most recent fec filing [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1624.96s)]
*  So I just thought was worth noting in terms of like the biggest donors out there [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1627.68s)]
*  So you got elon musk giving 75 million to a pro trump super PAC [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1631.68s)]
*  Miriam adelson sheldon adelson's widow gave 95 million to another super PAC [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1636.4s)]
*  Uh dick uline another billionaire. You've probably never heard of gave 49 million ken griffin paul singer doing eight figures timothy mellon [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1642.16s)]
*  Gave 165 million dollars to various gop align groups earlier in the cycle [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1649.8400000000001s)]
*  And so what you're seeing now is the fruits of like this billionaire courtship them dumping money into super PACs and doing trump's dirty [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1655.3600000000001s)]
*  Work for him across the country and trying to tell regular people that they get their problems, right? Right? Like that's you [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1663.3600000000001s)]
*  Like we understand you like [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1669.6799999999998s)]
*  I mean, it's it's really it's a really messed up system like post citizens united. All of this is a disaster [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1671.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's completely broken. This should not be allowed to be happening. No. Thank you supreme court [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1678.08s)]
*  Um finally on this trump rally. I mean there was a lot of talk about immigration. I would say it was the primary thing discussed [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1682.32s)]
*  Here's one example. We are going to end all sanctuary cities [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1687.6799999999998s)]
*  immediately [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1692.3s)]
*  I can do it with an executive order. I'll have to do it with an executive order [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1700.24s)]
*  You can do it with alien the aliens act of 1798 [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1703.52s)]
*  We can do things in terms of moving people out. We can move them out of the sanctuary cities [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1707.52s)]
*  So again just to explain what he's talking about there because it's never clear [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1712.1599999999999s)]
*  Um trump is saying he can use a law passed in the 1700s when john adams was president [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1715.36s)]
*  Uh a law that was later used to authorize japanese internment to authorize sending u.s troops into cities [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1720.8799999999999s)]
*  That he doesn't think are sufficiently cooperating with ice or other federal immigration authorities [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1727.36s)]
*  So I guess like to paint a picture of what that looks like. I guess we're sending troops [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1732.6399999999999s)]
*  Into san francisco or new york in chicago to like ferret out people he thinks are undocumented [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1737.12s)]
*  I mean like again, this is like [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1744.8799999999999s)]
*  crazy [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1746.3999999999999s)]
*  Fascist behavior but helping people understand what that really looks like in practice seems very difficult [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1747.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it's like [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1752.08s)]
*  When they tell you who they are believe them and he's been he's been telling voters who he is for a very long time [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1753.76s)]
*  And it's pretty it's pretty fucking scary. So rebecca you're a political professional [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1759.36s)]
*  You're always trying to figure out how we reach these voters [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1763.6s)]
*  How do you think like this fox event compares to the caller daddy interview or other, you know kind of more niche? [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1765.76s)]
*  Um opportunities we've seen the harris campaign take [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1772.14s)]
*  So I think that harris campaign has done a lot of like I would say high risk interviews [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1775.28s)]
*  And I think for the most part they've gone extremely well and they've they've [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1780.16s)]
*  Right now the the the election is so tight you have to go find more voters, right? [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1785.3600000000001s)]
*  Like where can we reach more voters? So they're going out to all these different outlets and they're you know [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1789.6000000000001s)]
*  Trying to figure out like find voters where they are [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1794.0800000000002s)]
*  I found the call her daddy interview to be one of the better conversations i've ever heard from any public official [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1796.8000000000002s)]
*  especially [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1804.3200000000002s)]
*  The part where they are talking about what it means when you say life of the mother [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1805.44s)]
*  Like and harris going into detail about like you have to bleed out this much and be near dead [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1809.2s)]
*  For anyone to help you that is called life of the mother [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1816.16s)]
*  And I just found that so different from any other like the way you hear politicians speak [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1819.3600000000001s)]
*  And I think to the young women who are listening, I think it resonated [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1824.8000000000002s)]
*  I think and then she goes on harrid's turn and she talks about you know, formula one race like she's [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1828.3200000000002s)]
*  Let her do these longer form interviews where she's she's letting her personality come out. She's authentic. She [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1833.8400000000001s)]
*  She she's smart. She can like tell you a little bit about herself [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1840.64s)]
*  I think that's important for they it still goes down to like who would you rather have a beer with right? [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1844.4s)]
*  And she seems like she'd be really fun. Yeah, I like that. I have a drink with her. I bet she's more of a wine [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1849.68s)]
*  cocktail person a glass of wine [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1854.8000000000002s)]
*  We'll find out so yeah, let's talk about the the camel harris media tour. Um, she's in these swing states [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1856.8000000000002s)]
*  Apparently she's gonna do a fox news interview with brett bear that's gonna air after this [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1862.8s)]
*  Pod comes out on tuesday. She sat for an audio town hall meeting moderated by charlomane the god [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1867.6799999999998s)]
*  It was anything but a softball interview. Let's listen [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1874.1599999999999s)]
*  Does the biden administration have to take some blame for the border though a lot of the blame because I mean the first three years [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1877.9199999999998s)]
*  Y'all did get a lot of things wrong with the border charlomane [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1883.12s)]
*  Within hours of being inaugurated first thing we dropped [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1886.8799999999999s)]
*  Was a bill to fix the broken immigration system [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1891.5200000000002s)]
*  Which by the way trump did not fix when he was president [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1895.6000000000001s)]
*  Why are we sending money to other countries? Will we desperately need it in our own country for homeless? [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1898.0800000000002s)]
*  housing [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1905.0200000000002s)]
*  resources for whatever [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1906.5400000000002s)]
*  That is my determining factor if I vote for comelor or not [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1909.0400000000002s)]
*  We can do it all and we do but black americans are heavily asked to vote democrat [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1913.8400000000001s)]
*  And every election for over half a century with very little in return [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1918.96s)]
*  What are your plans? [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1923.6799999999998s)]
*  To address these very important issues and change that narrative. Thank you zee. I appreciate that. Thank you and thank you for your work [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1925.36s)]
*  So rebecca, I know you listened. I mean, what did you how do you think she did? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1932.1599999999999s)]
*  I thought she did really well. I thought there were some hard questions [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1935.44s)]
*  Like this was not a softball interview and she she answered each question with with like thoughtful answers [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1938.56s)]
*  sometimes [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1945.6599999999999s)]
*  It helps actually to get tough questions sometimes because I think it kind of jolts politicians out of complacency [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1947.52s)]
*  Like the first question is why are you always on your talkie points? [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1953.68s)]
*  And and her response was kind of like, I don't know. I'm disciplined. I just kind of like thought it was disarmingly honest and [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1957.2s)]
*  And and and it's true [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1962.6399999999999s)]
*  I mean [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1964.16s)]
*  She said you have to say a message at least three times for people to like for it to resonate like that is true [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1964.72s)]
*  Being on message is a good thing [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1970.16s)]
*  Trump is like all over the place, you know harris like goes to every audience and she tells them what she wants to do as president [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1972.8s)]
*  That's what you're supposed to do when you're running for office [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1979.04s)]
*  Do you think she's getting better at these or are we just hearing more of them and making? [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1981.52s)]
*  Less of kind of like individual slip-ups in one or the other [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1987.44s)]
*  I mean, I think it is I think a lot of these interviews are hard [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1991.36s)]
*  I feel like I I feel for the staffers, you know [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1994.8s)]
*  And perhaps like thinking trying to figure out any possible question that could get asked and talking about it [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=1997.52s)]
*  It's it's a lot. Um, I do think she's like I found her to be generally pretty warm in a lot of these interviews [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2002.32s)]
*  And I think I think that [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2008.4s)]
*  Resonates with people she sounded [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2010.4s)]
*  She was talking about stories of her life. She was she was giving examples. She was talking about her career [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2013.12s)]
*  I I think it's it's good to to do that [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2018.56s)]
*  I wouldn't mind her separating herself a little bit more from joe biden [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2021.76s)]
*  But other than other than that, I think she's been handling herself pretty well. Yeah, I think that was the one kind of [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2024.72s)]
*  error we've heard recently was [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2030.3999999999999s)]
*  Uh not the best answer on how are you different than joe biden and I understand the sensitivity there [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2032.56s)]
*  It's not easy. I mean if I got the question I would I think I would say something like [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2037.76s)]
*  obviously [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2042.7s)]
*  Me and joe there are things we would do different with the benefit of hindsight, but you don't have that as president [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2044.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm not gonna you know monday morning quarterback [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2049.84s)]
*  My you know running mate but here are the things I believe blah blah blah like make it perspective [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2052.32s)]
*  I mean, I right I would say some of us would like her to separate even more but she's also she [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2056.7200000000003s)]
*  you know, she is [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2061.6800000000003s)]
*  trying to be respectful too of him and you know, he [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2063.92s)]
*  Appointed her vice president. I don't I it's like you don't talk out loud about your friends [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2067.84s)]
*  Like I think she probably knows a lot of things that he could have done better and she just you know [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2071.92s)]
*  Uh did not go into that. Yeah, it's a complicated dance that it does for sure [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2077.44s)]
*  But you know the other thing about the charlomene interview they did it in detroit [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2082.2400000000002s)]
*  Um, which led them to get a bunch of additional local pickup which was smart [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2085.52s)]
*  Uh, the detroit free press headline was harris a kindred spirit with detroit [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2090.32s)]
*  She says after interview with charlomene the god, I think she did like another event with um [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2094.48s)]
*  Frame that yeah, I know seriously like that's gold right in politics [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2099.12s)]
*  Like who cares what the new york times says you want the detroit free press? [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2102.8s)]
*  Um, I think she did some more local stops afterwards. She met with black entrepreneurs [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2105.92s)]
*  So it's just smart. It was all around smart. It was it was smart to do charlomene [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2111.52s)]
*  It was smart to do it in a swing state [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2114.96s)]
*  It was smart to bring in a bunch of questioners who asked michigan specific [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2117.2000000000003s)]
*  Questions that sort of made it feel even more authentic to the state. Um [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2121.36s)]
*  What do you think though about fox news? I have to say like when I heard that she was doing brett bear [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2125.92s)]
*  I guess I get the meta messaging which is [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2131.12s)]
*  Trump's in a safe space. I'll go anywhere talk to anyone. I'm like fearless [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2134.2400000000002s)]
*  But I also think when you you might as well do an interview [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2138.7200000000003s)]
*  With jason miller or someone from the rnc, right? Like when the chips are down fox news [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2141.76s)]
*  We can all pretend brett bear is like the reasonable one. He takes orders right and fox news wants trump to win [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2146.7200000000003s)]
*  I would say it's high risk high reward [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2152.8s)]
*  right, like I don't know if I would have [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2154.96s)]
*  picked that one, but she's [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2157.5200000000004s)]
*  I'm sure that will she will be [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2159.92s)]
*  Working for that like thinking about it and she's taken hard questions from lots of people [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2162.32s)]
*  I I think she can take some hard questions [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2168.48s)]
*  I think she's I think she's proven that she can do that and once you go on there and you [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2171.44s)]
*  You answer some of those questions. I think that matters to some of those viewers. She shows up [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2175.84s)]
*  I don't think all of fox viewers are that like excited about trump a lot of them are obviously [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2180.64s)]
*  But there's there's there are some reasonable voters out there and I think she's going to go after them [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2185.92s)]
*  Good for her. Yeah, and you know, there's some research that shows [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2190.48s)]
*  That when you're, you know showing ads to voters [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2194.4s)]
*  If you're just showing kind of like a clip from a network if it's on [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2198.8s)]
*  A conservative network that they trust maybe you get even more benefit from it, right? [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2203.2000000000003s)]
*  Like if it's like a wall street journal article, maybe conservatives are more likely to think it's credible than something in the new york time [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2206.88s)]
*  So maybe they're thinking about what things they could lift from the brett bear interview if it goes well for ads [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2212.16s)]
*  Yeah, I I just think like [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2217.68s)]
*  The whole team is probably looking at the numbers looking at how close every single state is and and thinking what can we do to shake this up? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2219.68s)]
*  Yeah, and the downside risk of a bad interview is like whatever if you're doing enough of them [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2226.3199999999997s)]
*  Um, you'll be okay. Hopefully hopefully that's the only downside [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2230.72s)]
*  Hopefully, yeah, we've all been there with fingers. Yeah [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2234.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's real bad. The last one that that keeps getting reported on is joe rogan [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2236.64s)]
*  There was a report. I think it was um reuters that was like camila harris considering doing [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2240.8799999999997s)]
*  Joe rogan's like what kind of news report is that? How do you have a headline? [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2246.32s)]
*  It was like a weird float like they floated that out there. I don't I don't know where it exactly came from [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2249.6800000000003s)]
*  It could be interesting. I mean, I think they both said they might do it. So [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2255.28s)]
*  I don't know. Let's let's give it a listen. I'm fully on board for doing rogan [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2259.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if this is translates to his audience [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2263.6800000000003s)]
*  But he has 14.5 million followers on spotify which would make him like the biggest podcasts out there by far [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2266.56s)]
*  And much bigger than most network or cable shows. I don't think he's like [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2273.7599999999998s)]
*  super [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2278.88s)]
*  Partisan republican. I think he's more of an rfk guy. He has lots of weird hobby horses [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2280.0s)]
*  Like he's obsessed but we need those voters. I mean we you know, like she has to get some of those too [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2285.68s)]
*  So I think I think it could be smart and I think there's there's a lot of caricatures out there of her [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2290.4s)]
*  But when you see her like talking like she sounds pretty normal. Yeah, you know what I mean? [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2295.52s)]
*  So I think that's good. Why isn't she on hot ones? That's my question. How come she hasn't gone on hot ones? [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2300.4s)]
*  I I think they would if they could i'm not sure if hot ones wants them. I think like they're I know they're in there [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2305.1200000000003s)]
*  She would be so good. She'd be so good. I would love to see that too [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2311.1200000000003s)]
*  All right, we're gonna take a quick break when we come back [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2314.48s)]
*  We are going to talk about how things are shaping up in some of the key states that rebecca knows incredibly well [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2316.4s)]

*  Especially in pennsylvania and arizona. So politico had a story out this morning [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2452.32s)]
*  About alleged disarray in the democratic effort in pennsylvania [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2457.44s)]
*  Um, it read to me [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2462.1s)]
*  as like [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2464.1800000000003s)]
*  Both kind of typical finger pointing you see when democrats are nervous stuff that gets over torqued by reporters [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2465.46s)]
*  There was a similar story the other day about super PAC spending and people sort of carping about the main [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2472.98s)]
*  Democratic super PAC and where they're spending their money [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2478.6400000000003s)]
*  But also like it was worrisome and it kind of dovetailed with some things [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2481.78s)]
*  I have heard about the organization in pennsylvania from people in the political world [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2486.02s)]
*  So, I don't know. What did you make of that? And what do you think's happening? PA? [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2490.9s)]
*  Okay, so this is so i'm from philadelphia, right? [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2494.1s)]
*  And I will say that there's a long history of hackery [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2497.38s)]
*  in philadelphia politics where a lot of people [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2501.86s)]
*  Want like a lot of attention, right? Do I think that there's real like some challenges to some of the campaign? [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2505.3s)]
*  Like yes [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2512.5s)]
*  I do, you know, we all worry about pennsylvania because pennsylvania is kind of ball game, right? [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2513.94s)]
*  But I do think there's a lot of finger pointing that just happened so that people can say like if the worst happened [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2518.6600000000003s)]
*  They they've already like blamed somebody else when really this is this is about all of us trying to come together and win this race [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2523.6200000000003s)]
*  um [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2531.7000000000003s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of really good people on the ground in pennsylvania [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2532.98s)]
*  One of the people mentioned the article brendan mcphillips [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2536.9s)]
*  He has run plenty of pennsylvania state-wide and he knows how to win and he's a senior advisor to the campaign [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2539.7000000000003s)]
*  There's a there's good people working. I just think [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2545.86s)]
*  I think they they haven't been holding hands with as many politicians and spreading the money around to as many [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2549.2200000000003s)]
*  Politicos as who wants it and I think that's part of the problem [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2556.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it's gonna be it's just a tough state too because there's massive spending on the presidential [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2558.7400000000002s)]
*  But you also have this hotly contested senate race where and house races and house races [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2564.26s)]
*  But like bob casey is running against mccormick who has not only the money he's raised personally [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2570.02s)]
*  But he has two of his hedge fund billionaire buddies who dumped money into their own super PAC [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2575.46s)]
*  So the spending in the state is just out of control [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2580.5s)]
*  So part of me is like mccormick of connecticut residency fame connecticut uh hedge fund leader dave mccormick, right? [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2582.82s)]
*  But with that much money being spent on ads is like, I I don't know what's actually breaking through [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2589.06s)]
*  I mean, it's really hard because you have a bunch of very competitive house seats in pennsylvania [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2593.78s)]
*  You have the senate race you have like you can't go anywhere in pennsylvania without being communicated to like one of the things [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2598.58s)]
*  Uh, one of my friends who when the phillies lost the only good thing about the phillies losing was that they don't have to watch [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2605.54s)]
*  Political ads every five minutes anymore because they won't be in the in the phillies games, you know, it's it's pretty intense. Yeah [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2610.74s)]
*  The one thing I did here when we were there a couple weeks ago [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2617.86s)]
*  A very well connected person said to me i'm worried about harris in the philly suburbs. Have you heard anything about that? [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2620.2599999999998s)]
*  I don't buy that. I mean maybe maybe they're more connected than I am, but I think I think harris is gonna really [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2626.5s)]
*  Turn out in the suburbs. I think I think her voters are really going to come out for her [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2632.58s)]

*  Okay, so let's have some good news. We never you know, like so there is a montgomery county commissioner [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2664.98s)]
*  His name is neil mckesia [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2669.86s)]
*  and [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2671.7000000000003s)]
*  montgomery county is one of the few county like one of the best turnout counties in pennsylvania is the suburb of philadelphia [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2672.82s)]
*  And when your ballot isn't quite right like if you mail in your ballot and there's an error they throw it out, right? [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2678.3599999999997s)]
*  but what he's doing is when they come in with ballots that are um [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2684.68s)]
*  That there's problems they go in like a old like ice cream truck and go find voters and help them [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2688.6s)]
*  Make their ballots correct. So their vote counts. So here are all [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2694.68s)]
*  Yeah, so here are all these people out there who are trying to make their like trying to say like there's conspiracies or you're late [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2698.3599999999997s)]
*  They don't want your vote to count like and here's a good story in pennsylvania [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2705.16s)]
*  Someone trying to get every vote in so that every voice counts. I love that. We need more people like that [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2708.36s)]
*  See if you're exact if you're anxious and texting your friends about doomer shit go do that [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2713.48s)]
*  Um, the other state that we talk about a lot of arizona. We were there a couple months ago [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2718.04s)]
*  It was 110 degrees. I couldn't believe it people are canvassing [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2722.7599999999998s)]
*  Um, the polling has been noisy the journal had harris up to on sunday [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2726.44s)]
*  The times cnapole had trump up five on saturday [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2730.92s)]
*  The average the times average has harris up to the 538 harris average has trump up 1.5 [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2734.52s)]
*  God only knows what's right, right? It's all in the margin. This is why you should stop paying attention to polls [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2740.84s)]
*  It's only going to make you crazy make you crazy. I can't even follow them let alone [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2744.68s)]
*  make uh keep track of them so [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2748.7599999999998s)]
*  You're working on ruben giego's senate race there [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2751.24s)]
*  Um, which means i'm not going to ask you for any, you know privilege information unless you want to cough them up [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2754.12s)]
*  I do not okay [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2759.24s)]
*  democrats [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2760.7599999999998s)]
*  Generally seem to be optimistic about giego less optimistic about harris. What do you think about that? [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2762.1s)]
*  So what I would say is arizona is still arizona [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2768.2799999999997s)]
*  Like there's still more republicans in independence than there are democrats like we should be concerned with arizona [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2770.8399999999997s)]
*  And that means it's not like it's going to be a walk for ruben giego either like we should all be [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2776.52s)]
*  You know taking this very seriously on all levels. I do think that harris is out there [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2781.7999999999997s)]
*  You know really trying to [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2787.3199999999997s)]
*  To spread her message to voters. She's got she's talking a lot to the republic like reasonable republicans [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2789.64s)]
*  In arizona, and I think at the end of the day [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2795.96s)]
*  I think she's going to bring a lot of them over to her [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2798.3599999999997s)]
*  I really do carrie like it's so wild to watch her go from being the craziest person in all of politics to try to [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2800.2s)]
*  Just sand off the edges and go like full [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2806.44s)]
*  gauzy lens barbara walters like [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2809.16s)]
*  This new person out there on the campaign trail is it? [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2812.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't think it's fully work. No. No, I don't think people are buying that. I mean, I think she is [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2815.4s)]
*  She is someone who is really out for herself and at the end of the day everything comes back to [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2820.68s)]
*  What she wants and she is not someone who is fully truthful [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2826.6s)]
*  Um, I do I do think voters see through her, but I also think like she's not really [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2830.12s)]
*  Trying to convince anyone she told mccain republicans to get the hell out of the party [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2836.92s)]
*  You know rubin has spent two years going to every like community in arizona across across the whole state and meeting voters where they are [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2841.0s)]
*  And talking to them and he he understands that like he's a working-class kid. He may he's a veteran [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2848.04s)]
*  Um, and he has really connected with a lot of people and they're like, you know [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2854.2s)]
*  I'm a republican but i'm voting for ruben when we saw him at the live show when he was our guest [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2857.32s)]
*  A couple weeks ago when you were there. I feel like he had been [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2862.36s)]
*  Marching in a parade at like 7 a.m [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2865.32s)]
*  That morning someplace five hours away and then drove through the sounds like all right, this guy's grinding [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2867.88s)]
*  Um, so you're working on this race [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2872.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, what is it telling you what you're seeing in the numbers in arizona about latino support for democrats generally because that's a huge concern [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2874.36s)]
*  so [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2882.2s)]
*  So a lot of latinos in arizona and you know every are independents, right? [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2883.16s)]
*  And I think that democrats traditionally have used them as a turnout audience and not as a persuasion audience [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2887.56s)]
*  Which means that it's been about turning out the vote not actually communicating with latino voters [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2894.92s)]
*  And I think what rumen has been doing over the last two years is actually communicating [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2900.76s)]
*  To voters about what he wants to do as a senator and I think democrats [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2905.96s)]
*  Need to talk to voters more about their plans and not just say like you're with us [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2910.84s)]
*  Let's turn out the vote and I think we're doing that but it it took a minute like we've been [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2915.88s)]
*  A little slow like democrats in general with voters of color of understanding like [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2921.48s)]
*  You should actually persuade them to to vote for you and you don't just have you can't take any votes for granted [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2926.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I would have liked that to happen a little quicker. Yeah a couple years ago finally [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2931.1600000000003s)]
*  So let's talk about a couple critical house raises. We have not [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2935.0s)]
*  We've barely talked about you know, the house on this show nobody talks about the house. Nobody gives the house any love [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2938.04s)]
*  I know i've made this pitch before i'm gonna say it again [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2944.12s)]
*  If you are sitting at home and you are terrified that trump is gonna win [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2946.68s)]
*  The best thing you can do beyond helping harris is like making sure trump would have a check on his power [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2951.0s)]
*  And that is delivering a democratic house. The house is very winnable, right? [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2956.92s)]
*  There are races all across the country probably near a lot of your listeners. There's [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2961.72s)]
*  races in california in new york and then all in the purple and red states that that democrats can win [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2967.08s)]
*  um [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2973.8s)]
*  We saw in northern new jersey. Sue altman is now like neck and neck with tom keene [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2974.92s)]
*  That's a good democrat to give to janelle steltson out in pennsylvania york york pennsylvania. It's like traditionally [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2980.36s)]
*  uh trump air republican area [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2987.4s)]
*  But uh, scott perry's like a little too went a little too far a little too maga for that district and I think she has a great chance [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2989.96s)]
*  Um, there's jonathan nez the former navajo nation president who's running against elie crane in arizona [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=2996.76s)]
*  I mean we have so many good candidates [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3003.0s)]
*  And I just I think like number one the democrats are doing the work [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3006.44s)]
*  They're raising they're out raising all of these republicans. They're they're they're trying to like communicate their message [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3009.8s)]
*  And they are they are normal people and that we should try and be behind them and elect them [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3016.6s)]
*  So is there like a dynamic you're seeing broadly? [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3021.48s)]
*  Are these house races or the democrats running ahead of kamala harris? [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3024.44s)]
*  Are there candidate quality issues? I know there's so many races [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3028.52s)]
*  It's hard to draw with a broad brush or anything. We should learn from it. I think a lot of these [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3031.16s)]
*  Republicans are running as as maga candidates [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3036.1s)]
*  In districts where they where people don't want that [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3039.08s)]
*  And I think democrats are doing a good job of of raising money from from small dollars, you know from small donors to [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3042.84s)]
*  To just communicate their message and talk about what we stand for. I think [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3049.72s)]
*  Democrats have been more inviting to people who are to who disagree than than maga republicans are at this moment [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3053.86s)]
*  Yeah, oh, that's 100 true [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3060.28s)]
*  I mean as you mentioned earlier carrie lake told them to to get out of the party if you're not a if you're not a trump fan [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3062.2s)]
*  Well, that is good advice and also another thing you can do if you're anxious [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3067.88s)]
*  I know we're gonna we're gonna all knock on doors here in some of these california races because california new york, man [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3070.52s)]
*  I mean that could be that could tip this whole thing. Yeah, I mean can you imagine like [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3075.88s)]
*  Like I would say the the new york is where we lost the house last time and it could be where we win the house this time [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3080.68s)]
*  Right battleground new york battleground california go check out those [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3086.92s)]
*  Websites because they they can you can go out right now and help help them out [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3091.2400000000002s)]
*  Have you guys got your shit together? Is everyone just still getting arrested? What's happening in new york new york's a disaster [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3095.48s)]
*  I'm not defending new york. I mean this let me just vent about the state party. Just one second [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3103.08s)]
*  The new york democratic party was not built to win general elections. Why it is a disaster because they never thought they had to [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3108.44s)]
*  They are they are a mess. They've been a mess for years [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3116.68s)]
*  They care more about beating progressives than they care about beating republicans [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3119.3999999999996s)]
*  it is [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3123.56s)]
*  I think it needs some you know, some some cleaning out a little refresh [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3125.56s)]
*  Well, it's so frustrating because like you you see these states where there is a really smart well-functioning [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3130.4399999999996s)]
*  State democratic party like wisconsin, right? [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3138.2s)]
*  Where they've had people in place doing the work for years and years and years and you can see the impact on the ground [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3140.68s)]
*  You see how professional they are you see them doing events and off years and winning state supreme court races [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3146.52s)]
*  And and knocking on doors 18 months before an election and doing deep canvassing [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3152.92s)]
*  And persuasion and not just go tv events and dumb ads at the end [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3157.72s)]
*  And you're like, yeah [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3161.96s)]
*  I will give all the money I have to wisconsin democrats the wisconsin democratic party because they are so [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3162.52s)]
*  Competent, but it's like how do we take ben wichler the chair there and and clone him and send him the 50 states [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3168.04s)]
*  I mean, I think the problem is that there's there's a lot of red pockets in in blue states [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-FT-a78sw&t=3174.44s)]
