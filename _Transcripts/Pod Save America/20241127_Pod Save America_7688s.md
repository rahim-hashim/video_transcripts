Video Description: Lovett sits down with Hasan Piker (@HasanAbi)  the massively popular progressive streamer, to talk through (and argue about) the hard questions about where the Democratic Party needs to go from here, the liberal media landscape, what the Harris campaign told us about why they lost, and yes, a jobs program for incels. Then, Jon talks to Massachusetts Congressman Seth Moulton about the fight for the House, why blue states like his swung right, and the controversy he kicked up with his comments about trans athletes.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

*  Also on the feed right now [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  You can hear Dan's conversation with Jenna Malley Dylan Quentin folks David Plouffe and Stephanie cutter about [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=31.9s)]
*  What went wrong in the Harris campaign? We're having a bunch of conversations about [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=38.56s)]
*  What we learned from the election where we go from here with a bunch of different voices one of which is here today [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=44.96s)]
*  People are mad that we talked to the Harris campaign. Yeah, man. We're talking to you people are mad and that's okay [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=51.68s)]
*  Yeah, but let's start with this. There's big tent. It's a it's a big big. It's a big tent [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=57.6s)]
*  All right, Nick Cheney in it. It's got dick Cheney in it. It's got Hassan piker in it [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=63.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's got Dan Osborne in it. I got Seth Moulton in it. Yeah. Yeah, you know tent shouldn't maybe [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=67.96s)]
*  Feature dick Cheney in it, but you know everybody else we can I can have a conversation with great [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=76.0s)]
*  All right [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  Now look the main pastime on the left other than being mad for the last few weeks is everyone saying how right they were [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=82.12s)]
*  All along about Democrats being out of touch and bound to lose [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=86.80000000000001s)]
*  I'm arrest me [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=92.2s)]
*  Sorry, so we had a I sat at this chair [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=94.64s)]
*  Well, maybe not as a chair, but I had the offline interview with with John [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  I think a month before [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=104.88000000000001s)]
*  The the election and a lot of the things a lot of the concerns that I brought up to him it seemingly [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=107.52s)]
*  came across as [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=114.6s)]
*  somewhat prescient or people people went back to the to the footage and [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=116.6s)]
*  Been seeing comments that were rather positive about like, you know, okay [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=121.47999999999999s)]
*  He said a lot of stuff there that was objectively correct seeming [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=125.16s)]
*  Yeah, let's I want to talk about one aspect of that which is that you were saying others were saying that hey like [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=128.88s)]
*  Trump going on [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=136.44s)]
*  Rogan Trump going on Theo von [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=138.16000000000003s)]
*  like something is happening here and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=140.56s)]
*  We need to understand it. We need to address it. It's it's real and I'm like my experience [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=143.08s)]
*  It's like seared in my mind of [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=150.52s)]
*  Trump being on Joe Rogan because of how [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=153.28s)]
*  like my path of understanding it because what I saw first were a bunch of people taking clips and saying wow [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=156.84s)]
*  Rogan really didn't like Trump Trump. Just Trump is a mess on this show. He comes across terribly [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=164.84s)]
*  Rogan was like like kind of [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=171.6s)]
*  Giving Trump space to hang himself [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=175.36s)]
*  Rhetorically and then I watch it and like Trump did fucking great in this interview. Yeah, he's very telegenic [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=178.04s)]
*  That's the thing that like a lot of people I guess refused to factor in for some weird reason is that yeah [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=183.44s)]
*  He definitely rambles on he likes to call it the weave and even Joe Rogan made fun of him for that a little bit [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=189.96s)]
*  in the process, but like there is something to be said about a [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=195.60000000000002s)]
*  relatively telegenic person who is able to portray himself as I like to call it [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=201.8s)]
*  Honestly dishonest. Yeah, we're like everybody knows he's a bit of a scumbag, but he's your scumbag and [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  He's able to get that across to a lot of people and and I don't think that there is [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=213.72s)]
*  really anyone with that level of television presence on the Democratic Party front I think like [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=220.72s)]
*  the most skilled order in the Democratic Party's ranks in the last [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=228.48s)]
*  you know last couple of decades was obviously Barack Obama and [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=233.6s)]
*  And [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=236.84s)]
*  Outside of that, I don't I think like in a lot of instances purely from optics point of view [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=238.48s)]
*  Democrats track is like technocratic [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=243.8s)]
*  elitist [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=246.52s)]
*  too [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=247.72s)]
*  Too serious about everything that they talk about and there's certainly a lot of that on the Republican Party side as well [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=249.16s)]
*  and we've seen failed initiatives from [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=255.16s)]
*  Establishment Republicans that tried to recreate the Trump phenomenon with the likes of Ron DeSantis and that was a massive failure [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=258.2s)]
*  but [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=266.2s)]
*  Ultimately, I think this goes beyond podcast. This is something that I've been talking about quite frequently [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=268.2s)]
*  I know the podcast thing is like the most yeah, like that's the one that got everyone's attention, but [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=272.52s)]
*  I I said this on CNN [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=277.68s)]
*  Last night that you can't really podcast your way out of this problem like having you know [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=280.32s)]
*  There was that one tweet saying like oh, we just gotta have a hundred pots save America's [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=286.24s)]
*  But they all have to look like Hassan like that's not it's not how this works [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=291.08s)]
*  you think that one that one tweet might have been wrong, but the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=295.56s)]
*  Yeah, like I guess [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=298.96s)]
*  So I agree with that, you know, it became this the couple kind of like I don't know like just have had this [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=300.68s)]
*  Devastating loss to Trump and everybody's looking for these sort of little explanations that all feel [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=308.15999999999997s)]
*  like [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=313.91999999999996s)]
*  They just feel silly like oh we need a Joe Rogan of the left and even saying [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=314.91999999999996s)]
*  Like I don't even want to talk about how stupid that is anymore because even that has become [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=319.0s)]
*  Stupid but I'm like I I do agree that like people are like, oh well, she should have gone to Rogan [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=324.12s)]
*  All right. Yeah, sure. I think so too that would not have changed the outcome of this election [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=328.15999999999997s)]
*  there's a larger problem to what you're getting at which is like why don't we have figures and where like we think they would do great on [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=332.2s)]
*  that show and [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=338.68s)]
*  Why is someone like Joe Rogan now who was? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=340.0s)]
*  Four years ago open to Bernie now suddenly open to Trump like that's the deeper problem [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=343.96s)]
*  You look at like successful Democratic messengers or progressive messengers over the last like [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=349.12s)]
*  Decades and you think all right. Well, Bill Clinton obviously was successful and he like ran against [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=355.12s)]
*  The Democratic Party in some way Barack Obama did the same thing Bernie does the same thing [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=361.24s)]
*  I would see does the same thing not on I'm not talking about on policy [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=366.2s)]
*  Yeah, you don't mean it like also in the same direction of running [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=369.04s)]
*  No, no, no, no, but running against the establishment in some way and just saying and and what I the reason I connect them [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=371.88s)]
*  is because they all did something which is [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=377.92s)]
*  Demonstrated that they were not part of the Democratic establishment both like on policy and rhetorically, right? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=382.16s)]
*  Like that's what they all did [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=389.04s)]
*  And I'm just wondering like what? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=390.96000000000004s)]
*  like the one place where like I know you like find, you know, I [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=393.64000000000004s)]
*  there's a place where there's like kind of an alignment of like the Seth Moulton critique of the Democratic Party and [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=399.28000000000003s)]
*  The lefty critique of the Democratic Party, which is just like it's fucking annoying and like kind of I don't know like pedantic [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=405.48s)]
*  In some way, it's an incorrect interpretation an incorrect autopsy [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=413.28000000000003s)]
*  To look back at a thing that the Democratic Party did not do it all and then say it's actually that reason [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=417.96000000000004s)]
*  It's not anything that we did so far [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=424.04s)]
*  It's not that we tacked to the right over and over again [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=426.04s)]
*  Despite people like myself and many others saying like don't do this. You're gonna hemorrhage the base [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=429.64000000000004s)]
*  You're gonna hemorrhage the base of support. You are going to cut away at your turnout. You're gonna cut across [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=433.64s)]
*  many different constituencies that you rely on to to create an effective coalition and [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=439.96s)]
*  It's it's a very dangerous gamble to assume that you can decouple a lot of these people in the suburbs a lot of like white [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=445.84s)]
*  women specifically away from the Republican Party and vote for you instead [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=453.36s)]
*  I know that they're high-propensity voters, but it doesn't matter [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=458.68s)]
*  There's still plenty of low propensity voters that you have to rely on to win and that's precisely what the Democratic Party did [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=462.71999999999997s)]
*  They hyper focused on [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=469.0s)]
*  These these key constituencies [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=471.08s)]
*  Despite the fact that polls were seemingly deadlocked after 30 million dollars of ad spend in key suburbs [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=473.4s)]
*  Right, like it showed at least I said this time and time again [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=480.52s)]
*  It showed someone from the outside looking in that the message was not working and you can have the best ground game possible [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=485.36s)]
*  You can have you know hundreds of thousands of people all across the country door knocking [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=492.40000000000003s)]
*  But if the top-down message that you're communicating is not resonating with people then you're not going to be able to win an election [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=497.72s)]
*  You're not going to have the effective turnout necessary to win this election [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=504.36s)]
*  And that is precisely what happened now. Does that mean that Trump's messaging was good? Of course not. It wasn't [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=508.08000000000004s)]
*  It was actually pretty bad and I would even go so far as to say the anti-trans ads were actually a distraction and not good [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=514.4s)]
*  It was only effective in the DC bubble [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=520.72s)]
*  I think and the consultant bubble in the and the media class that saw those ads and were like, oh my god [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=522.96s)]
*  This is an incredible ad like they really ruined Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris had a silly answer to a ACLU questionnaire [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=529.0s)]
*  Okay, that just shows that she is not the most experienced politician. This was all the way back and I believe 2020, right? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=536.24s)]
*  She literally had to drop out of the primary anyway at that time [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=542.96s)]
*  That's one thing. Okay, but that [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=547.2s)]

*  like I [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=741.46s)]
*  in before the last year like what my view of this was is Joe Biden this [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=743.3s)]
*  Consensus Democrat right actually to the right of the consensus for most of his career kind of somebody that would be kind of pulled [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=752.18s)]

*  that like whether it's because people didn't feel it or people didn't believe it or [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=773.26s)]
*  the [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=778.54s)]
*  The way Democrats talk about policy is ineffective like it didn't seem to matter in terms of how people viewed [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=780.06s)]
*  Like the Democratic response to the economy, right? They were so angry about inflation. They were angry about a bunch of other [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=787.4599999999999s)]
*  Issues and they really didn't matter what Joe Biden said or what Kamala Harris said they were held responsible [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=793.34s)]
*  And I'm just wondering what how you explain that right? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=797.9s)]
*  Like it seems as though Joe Biden tried to listen to this exact critique and it didn't matter [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=800.82s)]
*  So yes, and no [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=806.5s)]
*  I do agree. There are plenty of things that Joe Biden did like beefing up the NLRB and and [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=808.82s)]
*  letting the FTC [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=815.26s)]
*  rain hell upon [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=817.26s)]
*  These these [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=819.26s)]
*  Monopolies [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=820.74s)]
*  There's two issues there though [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=822.74s)]
*  One is I think something that you will agree with as well that the Democrats don't campaign year-round in the same way that Republicans do on key issues [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=824.74s)]
*  And they do have a massive communication problem that could potentially be solved by having a more robust ecosystem and more [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=831.74s)]
*  Collaboration with even the likes of yourself and maybe even someone like myself as well [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=841.14s)]
*  And and they need to always be on [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=845.82s)]
*  They need to always be counter messaging against the anti-immigration sentiment [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=847.86s)]
*  I went back and looked at my commentary from February of 2021 when the story of the Customs and Border Patrol Haitian [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=851.1s)]
*  migrants getting whipped by you know horseback Customs and Border Patrol people [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=859.22s)]
*  Officers was was in the news and I remember talking about how the Republicans are going to keep hitting the [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=864.3000000000001s)]
*  Immigrants are doing crime note over and over again because that's the one thing that they have [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=870.7s)]
*  And it's built around a complete falsehood that undocumented migrants are responsible for [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=874.66s)]
*  Incredible amounts of crime. It's not correct. There is no data to suggest this the data actually shows the exact opposite [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=879.9s)]
*  Undocumented migrants are your neighbors they contribute to the economy in very meaningful ways and they very rarely take anything in return [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=885.9s)]
*  Why is the Democratic Party not pushing this counter narrative and they never did instead of pushing that counter narrative? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=891.9s)]
*  Which is based in truth and talk about how undocumented migrants are responsible for less crime per capita than [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=898.42s)]
*  Natural-born US citizens are or that fentanyl being trafficked across the US borders are actually not coming in the knapsack of [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=904.66s)]
*  Otherwise law-abiding Abuela, but instead it's coming from regular points of entry [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=911.62s)]
*  trafficked by American citizens 90% of the people that are being apprehended for for chemical [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=917.2199999999999s)]
*  Compounds necessary for fentanyl or direct drugs that they're trafficking across the border are American citizens [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=924.1s)]
*  Like this is this does not [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=929.1s)]
*  Track with the the narrative that people believe because the narrative is dominated by the right on this issue [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=933.1s)]
*  They should have been counter messaging against that and they should have been [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=939.1s)]
*  They should have been putting bills forward [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=943.1s)]
*  in in defense of [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=945.1s)]
*  the [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=947.1s)]
*  The moves that for example governor Greg Abbott was engaging in in Ronda Santis [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=948.74s)]
*  I said this even back then that this is a actually a fantastic opportunity for the federal government to show [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=952.1800000000001s)]
*  That there is a more tolerant approach that one they should have immediately pursued governor Greg Abbott [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=958.1800000000001s)]
*  Legally and and arrested him for human trafficking and tried to prosecute him for human trafficking [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=965.3s)]
*  I don't care if it's a constitutional crisis or not all of this stuff was was a [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=970.1800000000001s)]
*  I think the Biden administration dropped the ball by not adding additional funds immediately sending additional funds immediately place like Chicago in New York and to [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=973.5s)]
*  To figure out a better way to transition a lot of these people and integrate them into [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=980.5s)]
*  You know America the American labor force and instead they just got stuck in this like legal limbo for no reason so why is it that? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=986.22s)]
*  They're trying to get people to do something that they're not doing [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=993.18s)]
*  The American labor force and instead they just got stuck in this like legal limbo for no reason so why is it that okay? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=996.38s)]
*  so Republicans say [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1004.38s)]
*  They sort of lay all these problems at the feet of undocumented immigrants. They say they're responsible for crime [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1006.7s)]
*  You know they they're not but there are obviously undocumented people are their people and some are committing terrible crimes [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1011.3s)]
*  Which they then exploit but for the most part these are people that not only are committing crimes at a low rate [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1018.18s)]
*  but actually are unable to go to the police when their victims of crime whether that's a [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1021.96s)]
*  That's a domestic violence [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1026.42s)]
*  they can't go to the police or whether that's just sort of the quotidian mayhem of living in America or a [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1028.7800000000002s)]
*  Boss taking advantage you they can't go to the police right yeah, then they say oh well [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1035.66s)]
*  They don't pay taxes actually that's not true [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1038.98s)]
*  They pay into Medicare they pay into Social Security [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1040.6200000000001s)]
*  And they don't get they don't get the benefits of it back, and then they say well all their their their [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1042.14s)]
*  Driving up the cost of housing I do not believe that undocumented people are the reason a house cost [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1048.0600000000002s)]
*  $450,000 where you just cost three hundred fifty thousand [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1053.38s)]
*  I didn't realize there were there were executives of Black Rock the the Guatemala migrants are are mass purchasing [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1055.34s)]
*  Mass purchasing houses and and making sure that everyone was a permanent renter. That's the point though, but it's not a trans person [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1061.94s)]
*  That's your landlord. It's not an undocumented immigrant. That's your landlord. That's raising the cost of rent [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1068.42s)]
*  It's not your manager is not an undocumented immigrant [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1072.42s)]
*  there are two big problems that one is there are a lot of people saying this and and [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1075.14s)]
*  It doesn't break through because there is this right-wing [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1079.34s)]
*  Media system that puts out this one story and the second problem is [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1083.18s)]
*  like [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1088.1s)]
*  Democrats really don't have trust on this issue with the people that they're trying to persuade [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1089.1399999999999s)]
*  To see it our way which I think goes to the the point you made before right which is [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1095.74s)]
*  Why is it that Donald Trump can meander around the country rambling? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1100.22s)]
*  Committing what in any other era would be if not like campaign ending like camp [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1104.26s)]
*  Campaign harming [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1110.94s)]
*  ridiculous statements gaff sure [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1113.42s)]
*  That that he can basically be an like a strategic [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1116.9s)]
*  Mess, but Kamala Harris has to hit every point exactly right. She if she she [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1121.38s)]
*  She says the wrong thing on the view or there's a bad interview from 2020 [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1127.72s)]
*  Those things can be campaign ending and I think to your point it goes to something deeper kind of a [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1132.1000000000001s)]
*  Lack of that like kind of I don't know core vision or or or [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1137.6999999999998s)]
*  Motivating mission for the current Democratic Party. Yeah something that is an [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1142.98s)]
*  Understandable easy to communicate simple policy that you can put your campaign around [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1148.5s)]
*  So so we agree on the messaging front a little bit at least or the the the asymmetry of how much [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1154.62s)]
*  you know right-wing media dominates the [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1161.26s)]
*  Ecosystem the media ecosystem in general all the way from independent outlets down to [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1164.14s)]
*  Traditional media were as far as I understand it 73% now [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1169.42s)]
*  I think of all news watchers are watching Fox News 73% that's an insane percentage. That's an insane number, right? [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1172.82s)]
*  So outside of that though, I think here is the disagreement that we will have [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1181.66s)]
*  That while Joe Biden did a bunch of stuff that I agree was positive [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1187.18s)]
*  It was simply not enough and [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1192.82s)]
*  That was something that I was always very critical on as well [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1196.06s)]
*  If you see a homeless person you chuck them two pennies and they're you know, they're sitting on the corner of the street [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1198.8999999999999s)]
*  Like yeah, technically their their material wealth improved by a percentage a decent percentage [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1205.1799999999998s)]
*  But he's still gonna be mad at you because you just gave him two pennies [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1212.6599999999999s)]
*  Why doesn't the homeless person understand that their situation is much better? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1215.46s)]
*  That is an that is not an effective way to communicate to Americans that like no you don't understand [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1219.5s)]
*  inflation is actually under control that the economy is rebounding even if it's objective truth because they [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1225.26s)]
*  Like most Americans don't understand what inflation is and they don't understand that prices are not gonna go down in that in that circumstance [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1230.94s)]
*  and [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1238.5400000000002s)]
*  besides that and I affected this is not just the the the vibe session [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1239.66s)]
*  Communications, but I'm also talking about specifically like even the IRA or many of these other many of these other [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1245.3s)]
*  like parts of the legislative agenda that [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1253.3s)]
*  That Biden put forth that was more progressive than I expected from more progressive than even the Obama administration in many respects, but [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1256.82s)]
*  One they didn't do a good job of communicating any of those victories in my opinion [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1265.5800000000002s)]
*  They did not they they did not actually like go to the media regularly to to show these victories into showboat and gloat a [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1270.18s)]
*  little bit to a lot of that was also held up in gridlock because we didn't whip votes well enough within [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1277.1000000000001s)]
*  Within our own party and I think that there was a lot of punishments that should have been dished out to the likes of Joe [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1284.7s)]
*  Manchin and the likes of Kirsten cinema rather than [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1290.44s)]
*  offering a green senator an opportunity to be a [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1293.5s)]
*  Prominent fixture of the Democratic Party [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1297.9s)]
*  I think that a lot more punishments should have been issued towards these people that use the moment of the spotlight to specifically [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1299.82s)]
*  Play the role of a rotating villain in the Democratic Party [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1307.78s)]
*  Which has happened time and time again all the way from Joe Lieberman to the Maggie Hassan's of the world the [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1310.42s)]
*  Kirsten cinema's the Joe Manchus of the world and the the problem solvers caucus is it within the [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1316.3400000000001s)]
*  within Congress in general [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1322.38s)]
*  These guys need to these guys need to get whipped into shape [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1324.42s)]
*  Yeah, I just like I wish I wish I believe that I just wish I believe that like I know but [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1328.3000000000002s)]
*  but I just like I don't know how much more you could have gotten out of Joe Manchin or [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1333.94s)]
*  Or Kirsten cinema like Joe Manchin basically was telegraphing the whole time [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1340.14s)]
*  Like like I'll walk away and Joe Biden kept him in the tent that got judges through that got the Inflation Reduction Act [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1344.5400000000002s)]
*  through like I just I do not believe like I [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1350.94s)]
*  I think we agree on a lot [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1354.18s)]
*  Like I just don't believe that there is a version of the Joe Biden presidency that could have been more successful on [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1356.02s)]
*  Legislative policy, I just I don't know you're not gonna appreciate what I'm about to say then hit me [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1362.98s)]
*  use the IRS and also the SEC and maybe even the FTC to [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1367.7s)]
*  Investigate as to why Joe Manchin's brother owns a coal mine and whether there's a conflict of interest there [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1374.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1379.9799999999998s)]
*  investigate why Joe Manchin's daughter is [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1381.1799999999998s)]
*  Selling pharmaceutical products to the state of West Virginia when Joe Manchin is directly at odds with you know, any sort of bill that passes [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1383.58s)]
*  that that [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1392.4599999999998s)]
*  Would lower the cost of pharmaceutical so you want the president? [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1393.82s)]
*  Yes to politicize these agencies and use them to go after people because you want to know why tell me why and hey [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1397.6599999999999s)]
*  Tell me why because they're doing it at the behest of [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1403.1s)]
*  Not only the American people their interests but they're also and this is probably going to first should everyone in this audience [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1406.62s)]
*  But here's here's the thing that I get a wide range of wide range of listeners across a broad ideological [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1412.6599999999999s)]
*  Here's what really frustrates me what for about the way the Democratic Party [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1417.54s)]
*  Operates they love norms. They love institutions for sure civility [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1422.3799999999999s)]
*  They they care about bipartisanship for the sake of bipartisanship as though that is something that some do some don't yeah sure [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1427.06s)]
*  But for the most part the broad communication coming out of the Democratic Party is that these are the things that they care about [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1433.6200000000001s)]
*  These are the top-line issues. We got to protect democracy [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1439.38s)]
*  We're gonna preserve our institutions the problem is the other side doesn't give a shit about that [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1441.66s)]
*  so I think I want a Democratic Party that fights for me and [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1446.22s)]
*  Others who are marginalized other people that like desperately need help and I know that the Republican Party is never gonna do that [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1450.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm not one of those guys who's like, oh well, you know [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1457.3200000000002s)]
*  At least I at least the Republicans are kind of listening to what I have to say or or are [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1459.72s)]
*  You know communicating channeling the anger that I feel like I don't care. They're they're charlatans. They're significantly worse than the Democratic Party [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1465.0800000000002s)]
*  I don't like the Democratic Party for their closeness to the Republican Party [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1471.8400000000001s)]
*  I want them to be a party that actually fights for the working class for all Americans unconditionally [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1475.76s)]
*  regardless of ideology and you can't do that through bipartisanship with an otherwise like hostile [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1482.24s)]
*  entity that is the Republican Party and [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1489.24s)]
*  I think there is a lot of hypocrisy there and the and hypocrisy that people can see [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1492.24s)]
*  Hypocrisy is the easiest thing that they can understand [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1498.6000000000001s)]
*  You can't say that these guys are fascist [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1500.6000000000001s)]
*  these guys are racist for eight years for wanting to build a wall and then turn around on and [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1502.3200000000002s)]
*  Straight up tell Anderson Cooper in that town hall. Well, maybe the wall is a good idea and I want to build it myself [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1507.72s)]
*  I'm gonna be the borders are I'm gonna be the border party. You can't do that [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1512.64s)]
*  Americans look at that and go [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1516.24s)]
*  So you're admitting that you were just lying for the last eight years. Well, it's like again though. It's like I [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1518.32s)]
*  Think actually you look at somebody like Dan Osborne, right who ran so far out of the Democratic Party ran as this economic populist [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1525.2s)]
*  But one of the things he had to do to get there was kind of be tough on [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1531.6s)]
*  immigration and actually like I think part of it goes back to like if people felt like they knew [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1536.88s)]
*  Like in their bones like like Bernie Sanders being to me like the signal example like you know what Bernie's about [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1543.4s)]
*  You know what he's for, you know what motivates him. You know what he cares about [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1549.88s)]
*  It's anything for Trump, you know, like, you know when there are issues [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1552.52s)]
*  You know fuck about and there's issues he really really cares about [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1554.8s)]
*  Immigration is one trade right like you know the things that like don't that have been anti-crime whatever [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1557.88s)]
*  That there are things that have been in Donald Trump's like kind of [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1563.72s)]
*  A [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1567.14s)]
*  Brain slowly losing plasticity [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1568.7s)]
*  But it better like kind of solid in there [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1571.02s)]
*  And for Bernie, you know, like we know why he's in politics and that gives a politician the space to kind of challenge [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1573.0600000000002s)]
*  Orthodoxies in the party or kind of run counter to it to signal to the people. Yeah, you need to signal to now like [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1580.98s)]
*  You know you say oh you can't you can't call them fascist and then also work with them [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1588.18s)]
*  Like yeah, yeah [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1593.78s)]
*  But at the same time Joe again like it's like I just don't know what to do with this nuance Joe Biden pet [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1595.4199999999998s)]
*  Like I am glad Joe Biden did the Inflation Reduction Act and an infrastructure bill and a gun bill and the Chips Act [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1599.9399999999998s)]
*  And a bunch of other stuff. I'm glad he was able to do all of those things [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1606.34s)]
*  I'm glad that he was able to use his kind of like [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1609.9399999999998s)]
*  Moderate brand whatever to kind of bring people in and get some stuff done [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1614.06s)]
*  Like I don't think the country is better off if he didn't do those things [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1618.86s)]
*  So like [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1622.14s)]
*  You describe it as hypocrisy like it's compromised like it politics requires [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1624.3s)]
*  Compromise the the Republican Party rarely ever compromises. They're uncompromising. You only have to beat them [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1629.5800000000002s)]
*  But that's not true though [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1636.18s)]
*  Like I agree with I agree with that on Trump, but that's just not true [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1637.1000000000001s)]
*  Like the re they did compromise right they like these are there there are plenty of people on the Republican side that were furious at [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1640.22s)]
*  Republican senators for going along with some of these Biden bills, right? Like those are people that did compromise [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1646.4599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, there is a million examples [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1651.9399999999998s)]
*  however of Republicans that are obstructionist that I'm sure you of course presenting that go back to their town halls and lie about all [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1654.06s)]
*  The money that they brought back home. Absolutely bills that they voted against so ultimately we now know that [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1660.4199999999998s)]
*  political polarization is set in in a way that [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1666.54s)]
*  Never really existed in American history until the last couple of decades, right? [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1670.34s)]
*  I think that parties originally were more [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1675.04s)]
*  Geopolitically focused on their immediate needs like statewide needs [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1679.16s)]
*  So you saw you saw this dramatic shift and now the Republican Party, especially with Mitch McConnell under the Obama administration [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1683.16s)]
*  Showcase that like permanent obstructionism is not punishable and that gridlock is always considered [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1691.84s)]
*  The the the administrative party's problem if there's any sort of gridlock [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1699.48s)]
*  It's the fault of the leadership and Americans hate gridlock. Yeah, that's kind of the reason why I was talking about Kirsten cinnamon [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1703.2s)]
*  Joe Manchin because that was a massive [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1708.76s)]
*  massive moment where like [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1710.92s)]
*  They actually ended up [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1712.92s)]
*  Protecting the Republican Party because they were never gonna vote for these bills anyway [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1716.32s)]
*  And now the entire conversation was about like, you know madness within the Democratic Party's caucuses [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1719.6000000000001s)]
*  Like oh they can't get their ducks in a row, right? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1724.76s)]
*  like that was [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1727.64s)]
*  Genuinely frustrating to me because it's like if you don't if you had whipped your votes immediately [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1728.8799999999999s)]
*  Then you could showcase that the Republican Party is standing in the way of progress [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1733.04s)]
*  But that's just like that is legislative minutiae. What is more important to talk about is broad [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1736.24s)]
*  sweeping legislative changes or a agenda that might even come across as bold and [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1742.9599999999998s)]
*  Radical in the interest of the American working class. Joe Biden said he wanted to do the public option [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1749.24s)]
*  Everybody knew that wasn't real. He never talked about it after he just used the public option [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1755.76s)]
*  he slotted that in in the primaries when the party was primed to the Bernie left and [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1760.8400000000001s)]
*  Everyone was like, you know trying to communicate their own populist version of what Bernie was doing and and you know [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1766.3200000000002s)]
*  Joe Biden won the primaries and effectively tabled the discussion about health care. This is still a major problem [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1774.76s)]
*  regardless like yes [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1782.2s)]
*  Negotiating pharmaceutical prices and ensuring that insulin prices are capped to $35 [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1785.1200000000001s)]
*  Which is now going to be looking like a Trump victory when he's in office doesn't matter. It's still good for the American people [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1790.48s)]
*  So that's great. But like that is good, but that's not enough [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1796.2s)]
*  Yeah, and I think that I think that when you don't do that when you have this very technocratic [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1800.76s)]
*  Third-way neoliberal approach but you sprinkle in a little bit of like anti corporate anti billionaire populism that Joe Biden certainly did [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1806.64s)]
*  It's not [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1814.24s)]
*  Your your a rudderless ship [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1816.0s)]
*  You're not communicating effectively like what you are about and when you when you don't have a [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1818.28s)]
*  North star that every single person can point to and say this is what the party is about [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1824.96s)]
*  Your enemies can portray you as whatever they want and that's why the trans anti trans ads are even [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1830.3600000000001s)]
*  remotely effective because you can make the Democratic Party look clownish and [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1837.28s)]
*  And inconsistent and even silly and hyper focused on whatever key issues there are [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1842.08s)]
*  Because one they rarely ever focus on [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1849.2s)]
*  universality and programs everything has to be means tested which I think is is [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1853.52s)]
*  Both on the policy front and on the politics front garbage [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1857.96s)]
*  focus on universal programs because that way [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1862.32s)]
*  You can cut across every single group and you can disproportionately target [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1866.3999999999999s)]
*  marginalized populations black populations brown populations and trans people these like these people do not exist in a vacuum [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1872.6s)]
*  They're not magical mystical beings that are are not [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1880.12s)]
*  Are not experiencing the shocks of the market or they still have to pay rent. They still need workplace protections. They still need [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1885.08s)]
*  You know, they still need the cost of medicine to go down, right? So [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1892.48s)]
*  Universal programs capture the attention of all Americans including this majority white angry [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1897.8400000000001s)]
*  population that is [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1904.44s)]
*  finding themselves in the throes of the Republican reactionary movement and [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1905.92s)]
*  So they need to do that and if they don't do that then the subtle [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1910.48s)]
*  Populism of the right is always going to be the only only game in town and they're gonna be able to present themselves as anti-establishment [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1915.76s)]
*  While they have [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1922.6000000000001s)]
*  billionaires yeah parading around [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1924.16s)]
*  all of the [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1926.8s)]
*  All the campaign stops like Elon Musk trying to do that X logo every time he jumps like a child [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1928.48s)]
*  I hate Elon Musk. That is the trick though, man. They're like [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1934.08s)]
*  It does speak to like a like just how far like, you know one place where [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1939.04s)]
*  So if you listen to the Harris campaigns advisors talking to Dan Pfeiffer, I know you did and you had problems with it [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1946.8s)]
*  But one place where they agreed is that like hey like [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1953.8799999999999s)]
*  Everyone's saying oh this trans ad or this trans ad like it actually might not have been their most effective [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1956.8s)]
*  Yeah [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1961.4199999999998s)]
*  and they were trying to and and what Quentin Falk said was that like they were actually really trying to target it to get at [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1961.84s)]
*  Black men and it looks like maybe that didn't work, right? [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1968.24s)]
*  Oh, that's without that sort of we'll see like we're gonna get more data [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1972.4399999999998s)]
*  But like the the point that the ad makes is just that like Democrats are weird Democrats are strange [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1975.24s)]
*  Yeah, right and like they use trans people as a cudgel. Yeah to do that, but like to the larger point [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1982.08s)]
*  You have [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1988.92s)]
*  Billionaires just the wealthy literally the wealthiest man in the world the top seven the top seven donors [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1990.36s)]
*  This election cycle all donated to the Republican Party and they were donating like a hundred million two hundred million dollars [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=1997.08s)]
*  Like it was crazy. How how did like? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2004.0s)]
*  How do you think about the fact that in right-wing media right now and like right-wing adjacent media [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2007.24s)]
*  they are managing to be both the party of [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2014.44s)]
*  the wealthiest sort of oligarchs in the world and [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2019.08s)]
*  the kind of traditional moral set trying to impose a specific way of living on people and [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2023.3999999999999s)]
*  Anti-establishment kind of rebellious [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2030.6399999999999s)]
*  Politics it's Nazi Germany straight up. It's just pure fascism [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2033.8400000000001s)]
*  That's that's all this is it worked [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2039.64s)]
*  It worked a hundred years ago and it's seemingly working right now and it's not just the United States of America [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2042.4s)]
*  It's all across Western Europe the only country that bucked the trend of the incumbency disadvantage [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2048.08s)]
*  Seemingly was Mexico one must ask the question why an old dottering man? [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2054.88s)]
*  Who was still you know relatively telegenic even though he believed in wood elves duendes [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2061.44s)]
*  was able to [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2068.44s)]
*  Get a tremendous amount of popularity and then become the transition candidate that actually passed the torch [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2071.16s)]
*  to a younger woman [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2078.64s)]
*  Claudia Scheinbaum, I'm of course talking about Mexico. I'm talking about AMLO is the old man Claudia Scheinbaum was his [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2081.36s)]
*  Spiritual and ideological successor in the Moreno Party. Why did that happen? Why was AMLO so popular and [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2088.44s)]
*  Why is Claudia Scheinbaum also incredibly popular? Why did Claudia Scheinbaum? [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2095.6s)]
*  Win the election with even larger marches of victory than AMLO did it's because they expanded the welfare state [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2101.36s)]
*  They increased minimum wage and and you know, they made a whole bunch of decisions [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2107.84s)]
*  That that genuinely improved the material conditions of a lot of people in Mexico and that's something that people will never forget [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2114.08s)]
*  We talked about the black vote for a second [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2122.16s)]
*  as far as as far as voter patterns goes [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2125.3599999999997s)]
*  older black [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2130.7599999999998s)]
*  Populations like older black voters as a voting block is a more reliable voting block for the Democratic Party than younger black voters [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2132.48s)]
*  One must ask the question why that is because people remember the last time the Democratic Party did something for black people [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2138.8799999999997s)]
*  Did something bold expended social and political capital for black people and that is something that people do not forget if you give people [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2147.0s)]
*  Things they will not forget that that's why there was a lot of dummies who thought oh Trump's back [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2154.7999999999997s)]
*  We're gonna get some stimmy checks. It's not gonna happen, but they still remember that because they think oh, yeah, Trump gave us stimmy checks [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2159.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean well Joe Biden expanded [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2166.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean like I know I know and by the way, I'm not pushing back on any of this because I I don't like agree with [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2168.6s)]
*  the sentiment I just like I am trying in the weeks after this election to just like just like question these these sort of [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2174.04s)]
*  Statements because then it's like well, well Joe Biden [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2181.64s)]
*  Expanded the child tax credit made a huge difference. Yeah for millions of children [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2184.48s)]
*  No, absolutely the child that the expansion of the child tax credit was fantastic [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2189.16s)]
*  But it didn't continue it was so successful and it didn't continue [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2194.12s)]
*  like mm-hmm [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2198.7999999999997s)]
*  Do you think American people know why that happened? I don't I don't fault if American people don't know why that happened [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2200.56s)]
*  It's a well, that's a that's a I think some of it is Democrats [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2207.2799999999997s)]
*  Some of it is the mainstream media some of it is the right-wing media and some of it by the way is the left [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2211.7599999999998s)]
*  It is the media of the left, right? [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2217.3199999999997s)]
*  Like I the first couple years that there were there's been so many moments where [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2219.84s)]
*  by by great frustration, I think in the way politics has talked about is is [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2225.52s)]
*  Is often people do not want to to do the work of figuring out who's actually responsible, right like [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2232.6000000000004s)]
*  Republicans will shut down the the government and mainstream sources will say [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2241.32s)]
*  Washington gridlock continues right or [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2247.0800000000004s)]
*  Joe Biden will be stymied in some way or Barack Obama will be so why didn't Barack Obama do this? [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2250.44s)]
*  Why didn't Barack Obama do that when he had a majority, right? He said well because it's actually you know what in the Senate having [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2254.6400000000003s)]
*  49 votes to get rid of the filibuster and having 50 votes to get rid of the filibuster is a difference between [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2263.1200000000003s)]
*  Doing a ton of shit and not being able to do anything. That's not the result of all the 49 people [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2270.0400000000004s)]
*  49 people that's one person. Yeah, can I bring something really quick this conversation that you and I are having? Mm-hmm [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2275.0s)]
*  Have you ever heard a Republican have this conversation? [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2281.36s)]
*  Well, what do you mean like like Republicans ever heard a Republican go? [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2284.84s)]
*  Sorry, we couldn't get this done because we simply did not have the votes [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2290.48s)]
*  Is that ever like a real? [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2295.6s)]
*  Significant front-facing public conversation that the Republicans have [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2300.2s)]
*  I mean, I feel like you want the answer to be no, but like I do think the answer is yes [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2305.36s)]
*  I can't recall a time maybe you know, I'm asking you know, I like I've been I think on their side [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2309.28s)]
*  Like I think the I mean they have over the last decade [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2315.16s)]
*  slowly, but surely [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2319.28s)]
*  gotten rid of the people who are pointing out that the actual [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2321.04s)]
*  Things that stand in their way right like they went after Kevin McCarthy they went out [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2326.08s)]
*  Well, yeah, like and sometimes that works sometimes that leaves them [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2330.48s)]
*  Like pretty well stuck. I mean like Donald Trump was president for four years. He wanted to repeal the Affordable Care Act [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2334.44s)]
*  He didn't have the votes right? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2340.44s)]
*  There was a big conversation about why he didn't have the votes that like they're been like Republican the Republican base [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2341.8s)]
*  Like furious with spending spending bills that were passed, right? [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2349.52s)]
*  How did Donald Trump do after when John McCain struck down the Affordable Care Act? [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2354.0s)]
*  Well, what did he do? He took out the individual mandate regardless [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2358.2400000000002s)]
*  He did well he did what the same thing a Democratic president would do do as much as you can [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2362.3s)]
*  Legislatively and when it fails use your executive power, which is what Biden has done on student loans and a bunch of other issues [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2366.78s)]
*  Yeah, so my point is [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2370.86s)]
*  He still got the most significant aspect of his you know [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2373.1s)]
*  agenda across and [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2378.1800000000003s)]
*  In the process he utilized the bully pulpit to laser John McCain [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2380.1800000000003s)]
*  non-stop and [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2385.54s)]
*  Effectively bully John McCain in a way that I've never seen a Democratic president turn around and communicate about Joe Biden [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2387.1s)]
*  I'll hear it about the left about how their naysayers how their spoilers [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2394.5s)]
*  I never hear it about conservative Democrats and I think it's the whole talk about that [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2398.64s)]
*  That is the coalition that you want to have is my point and I think Democrats win or lose want to win by their own [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2403.94s)]
*  like established [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2410.22s)]
*  Policies and and the way that they want to win and they're willing to lose if necessary as long as they still maintain [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2413.22s)]
*  The the overarching attitude that they have I just think that is or maybe they're just bad and wrong [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2420.58s)]
*  Well, I just think they're like I think people need to be persuaded [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2425.8999999999996s)]
*  I think people need to be persuaded like David Plouffe talking to to fight for yesterday [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2428.14s)]
*  He's like look you go to a swing state. You got a certain percentage of liberals [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2432.16s)]
*  Progressives you have certain percentage of conservatives and you got this vast swath of moderates. You need them [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2436.7799999999997s)]
*  You need them now. I think where you're right is [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2440.58s)]
*  Like there is something about a Democratic establishment [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2443.58s)]
*  Establishment figures that feel more comfortable with a Liz Cheney [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2447.98s)]
*  Sitting at the table then with a leftist sitting at the table [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2453.18s)]
*  it's great and that the disagreements with Liz Cheney are more kind of [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2456.98s)]
*  are [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2461.7799999999997s)]
*  Acceptable and the disagreements to the left are less [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2463.2999999999997s)]
*  Acceptable but but one must ask the question [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2466.62s)]
*  Why is that acceptable Liz Cheney is anti LGBT Liz Cheney is anti abortion Liz Cheney is anti Democratic Party Liz Cheney is the daughter of a a [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2468.38s)]
*  rabid [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2477.02s)]
*  warmongering terrorist sociopath Dick Cheney and yet there are Democrats who are more comfortable with her than [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2478.22s)]
*  people who [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2485.62s)]
*  Also would totally be on board with the Democratic Party [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2487.02s)]
*  But I don't know have maybe sometimes identical opinions of Liz Cheney [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2489.82s)]
*  On even LGBT issues like Joe Rogan is a great example of this. Yeah, the Democratic Party has [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2495.98s)]
*  Consistently utilized and weaponized in the most cynical ways possible [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2501.98s)]
*  Identity politics and I say this as someone who is infinitely more progressive than the average Democrat on these issues [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2506.58s)]
*  They just use it. They use it against Bernie [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2512.66s)]
*  They use it against every they use it against every single person and now they're dropping it themselves that [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2514.82s)]
*  Makes every Democrat look like a silly fool that makes it does in the eyes of Americans [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2522.0600000000004s)]

*  We got to drop this woke shit [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2535.1800000000003s)]
*  Like of course people are gonna go. All right, I guess like I'm primed into now believing the Republicans like you're pushing your base [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2537.34s)]
*  Towards being more open-minded to right-wing policy is the only thing you're doing and that's how [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2544.78s)]
*  And that's the only thing you're doing when you don't actually claw back a lot of the things that the Republicans the former Republican administration [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2551.5800000000004s)]
*  Engages in like Democrats are very good at you know, trying to fix the deficit. They're the only real deficit hawks, right? [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2559.1000000000004s)]
*  Republicans certainly don't care. They only use it as a [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2565.3s)]
*  is a weapon to wield to communicate against the [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2568.26s)]
*  Democratic agenda but [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2571.7400000000002s)]
*  But outside of that like on foreign policy, Joe Biden said he was going to be an effective foreign policy leader [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2573.7400000000002s)]
*  He did NATO he kept talking about, you know NATO Jack AUKUS as though that was gonna be he loved talk about [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2580.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, like I have never been more [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2585.1400000000003s)]
*  I've never been more like nervous in politics like [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2587.5400000000004s)]
*  Other than the day before an election then when Joe Biden was still in the race and he did that press conference [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2591.3s)]
*  And he was like he talked about AUKUS. So you know, what the fuck AUKUS is. Yeah, okay [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2596.38s)]
*  That's a deep cut. That is a deep cut but like Joe Biden was like I am [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2600.7400000000002s)]
*  I'm the you know adult in the room Jack [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2605.78s)]
*  I'm gonna bring back America into the global stage the way that the American public sees that is like there's war in Ukraine [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2608.1400000000003s)]
*  Right and that's not even Joe Biden's fault. Like I understand that it's Vladimir Putin decided. I'm gonna do the insane thing [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2614.6600000000003s)]
*  I'm gonna invade Ukraine. That's psychotic, right? But the way that people see it [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2621.1000000000004s)]
*  They're like, why are we giving money to Ukraine when we're not fixing the potholes? [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2626.42s)]
*  Why are we giving money to Ukraine when the ISP suck here? What the hell's going on? [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2629.9s)]
*  Why are we giving money to you camera? We don't have health care. We have homeless people everywhere [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2633.42s)]
*  And then on top of that they see that instability is like something that is Joe Biden's fault [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2636.5s)]
*  Fair or unfair doesn't matter. They they attribute it to Joe Biden. I same thing with [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2642.6600000000003s)]
*  Israel Palestine they look to what is going on and they're like this is insane [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2647.98s)]
*  like why Biden will come out and say or used to come out and say [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2652.7000000000003s)]
*  You know, we're gonna do a two-state solution Benjamin in now the next day would be like fuck the two-state [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2657.7000000000003s)]
*  What do you mean? How about no state literally the next day and and [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2662.18s)]
*  Biden kept trying to do this thing where he was like finger wagging where he's like, oh, we're I'm really I'm gonna give him a [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2666.8199999999997s)]
*  Heart to heart, you know real man-to-man [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2672.2599999999998s)]
*  For for a lot of Americans. They saw that as like you're weak. You're old you're weak [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2675.06s)]
*  You're feeble and you're getting dog-walked by an American ally and in a very public and very embarrassing way [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2679.8599999999997s)]
*  And there's a metric ton of violence that's happening on top of that [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2686.8199999999997s)]
*  Like he ironically destroyed the the goodwill that a lot of people had [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2690.7s)]
*  Coming in to his administration [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2696.22s)]
*  with the the you know [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2698.98s)]
*  With the with the last I guess like post Afghanistan withdrawal [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2701.58s)]
*  Everything was bad after that with with respect to Joe Biden's foreign policy. It also just like it's it's also tied to I [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2705.54s)]
*  Still defend the Afghan withdrawal by the way [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2713.06s)]
*  and I think the Democrats also dropped the ball on that too because they're they they should have stand stood ten toes down and [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2714.9399999999996s)]
*  that was the right thing to do we exhibited political courage and [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2720.5s)]
*  For the record Republicans tried to do a 13, you know [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2724.82s)]
*  The 13 of our best soldiers died in Afghanistan thing over and over again the cynical thing that they tried to do [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2727.6200000000003s)]
*  Republicans are shameless Democrats are less so it's it like they should be shameless. I'm just I'm just I'm describing what the issues [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2733.38s)]
*  Yeah, I mean part of this though, too. Like I [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2739.54s)]
*  like [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2741.9s)]
*  Huge huge policy problem and how the body administration has responded [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2742.94s)]
*  To the war in Gaza, but [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2748.9s)]
*  On that issue on a bunch of foreign policy issues a bunch of domestic issues some of the problem has been [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2753.14s)]
*  Joe Biden [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2759.14s)]
*  Gave a state of the Union, which was good and everyone's like, okay [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2760.9s)]
*  I'm just that's what happened right? Okay, but other than that he has been such an ineffective [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2765.06s)]
*  Communicator that and it has gotten so much worse over the last year because he's old as I know I know but like [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2770.5s)]
*  We're in this moment where we're like kind of trying to like what went wrong. What about this? [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2778.5s)]
*  What about that people are so mad like the people are like like [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2782.38s)]
*  They're like the answers that that commas advisors gave were unsatisfying [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2787.66s)]
*  Yeah, they are unsatisfying but so much of this is just like there was a giant anti-incumbent [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2791.9s)]
*  Fervor around the world [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2797.9s)]
*  Joe Biden was completely unable to [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2800.32s)]
*  Articulate a defense of his policies, right? [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2804.4199999999996s)]
*  Like the fact that there is inflation and people are mad about inflation is not a reason alone [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2806.74s)]
*  Like that does like that explains [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2811.58s)]
*  That can explain why we lost if you accept that we had no agency in competing against that argument [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2814.1s)]
*  But like Joe Biden certainly had no like just could not communicate effectively [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2820.4199999999996s)]
*  I think you'll see what happens when someone effectively bullies corporations [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2825.06s)]
*  Regardless of being a right-wing Republican in the upcoming Trump administration [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2831.26s)]
*  Things are gonna get significantly worse for every single person [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2835.6600000000003s)]
*  Including the people that voter for Donald Trump one of the funniest aspects of the tariffs conversation that's happening right now [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2839.7000000000003s)]
*  Is that Donald Trump is gonna implement wide, you know broad tariffs on? [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2844.58s)]
*  45% of all trade that comes in and out of the United States of America Mexico Canada and China comprise [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2850.1s)]
*  45% of all trade he wants the tariff every single one tariffs are obviously an entry fee that like the the [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2856.94s)]
*  American corporations are gonna be paying none of the none of the countries are gonna be paying for these tariffs [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2863.3s)]
*  It's a it's a policy that's going to destroy [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2867.78s)]
*  Drop shippers which overwhelmingly vote for Donald Trump and the Trump merchandise industry. So that's pretty funny [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2870.7000000000003s)]
*  But having said that it's gonna be devastating for the economy now. What do I think Trump will do in the process? [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2877.6200000000003s)]
*  He'll obviously use tariffs to to basically get corporations and industries and sector leaders on board [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2883.18s)]
*  With his agenda [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2890.46s)]
*  So when he says jump they say how high or I'm gonna slap you with tariffs and it's gonna actually punish you [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2891.66s)]
*  it's gonna hurt your bottom line and [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2896.98s)]
*  I think that's part of the reason why they're gonna do that [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2899.22s)]
*  The other reason is this a regressive tax is a broad sales tax on all consumers that you know [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2901.46s)]
*  disproportionately affects the working poor and we're hoping to love that shit, but [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2907.42s)]
*  He also at times I think we'll just you know [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2912.14s)]
*  Institute the Defense Production Act or something like we'll see it [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2916.06s)]
*  We kind of saw it in kovat as well when it was a necessity, but but that's the thing like [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2919.02s)]
*  The American government is powerful all governments are powerful, but the American government is especially powerful [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2924.62s)]
*  it's the wealthiest nation on the planet and [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2930.7s)]
*  The way that it runs is basically it's like 50 companies in a trench coat [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2933.64s)]
*  We are working at the behest of corporations we we feed them with our tax dollars that turn into subsidies for them [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2937.74s)]
*  They utilize those subsidies to I guess lower production costs [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2944.3799999999997s)]
*  but then they use that to increase their profit margins and [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2947.7799999999997s)]
*  And engage in what used to be illegal pre Ronald Reagan, you know stock buybacks and the like market manipulation of all different sorts [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2951.2599999999998s)]
*  and we're constantly deregulating the economy and [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2958.66s)]
*  and I think that it's not just about having like a [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2962.66s)]
*  Populist message is about actually implementing said populist message and and show who your real enemies are [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2967.54s)]
*  like not be afraid to say these people are fucking your life up and [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2973.54s)]
*  If you are truly the pro working-class party as the Democrats want to be as they claim they were [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2980.62s)]
*  Historically right and there were certainly times when they were [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2987.46s)]
*  Then you have to say these corporations and the wealthy [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2991.34s)]
*  That have given us money as well as the Republican Party and always have been hedging their bets are the real reason why you're feeling [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=2996.7s)]
*  This economic anxiety the real reason why you feel hopeless [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3003.54s)]
*  That you will never be able to own a home that you'll never be able to retire and the Republicans are always in defense of them [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3007.02s)]
*  They will distract you with lies. They will say your fellow neighbors [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3014.9s)]
*  You know your God-fearing Christian Muslim whatever Jewish neighbors are your enemy when in fact [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3018.94s)]
*  We know what the problem is [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3026.34s)]
*  So we're gonna bring them to heel this kind of messaging is terrifying obviously for many different reasons [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3027.98s)]
*  And it will never happen within the Democratic Party [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3034.22s)]
*  Well, what in the absence of that I don't think that's true. Well, we'll see in the app [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3036.98s)]
*  No, I think you'll just get focus grouped messaging and means testing about the opportunity economy [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3041.5s)]
*  Which Kamala Harris presented at a time when people were you know when when wage growth had? [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3046.98s)]
*  never actually caught up to to [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3052.42s)]
*  The cost of living and cost of housing yeah, which by the way is like you need to be but this is but like [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3054.94s)]
*  Oh, you need to deflate housing. That's a that build you need to build vast amounts of housing. Yeah, the [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3060.7000000000003s)]
*  The federal jobs program get these fucking in cells to work [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3066.86s)]
*  Well, we got to get these in cells to work. No get him to work. Give him give him [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3070.86s)]
*  How do they like it or not? They're gonna get good well-paying jobs with good benefits [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3074.78s)]
*  Medicine and they're gonna and they're gonna work none of this neat stuff anymore. They can't they can't be online all the time [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3080.58s)]
*  They're they're too online. It's your business. Now you're gonna have your own this line [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3086.7799999999997s)]
*  I'm happy for like it [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3090.1s)]
*  I would I would drop everything if we got universal health care and a federal jobs program and and [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3092.06s)]
*  We're building public housing all around the country. That's fine. There's a place where the [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3097.8199999999997s)]
*  Left the the online left and the online right meets and it kind of meets a little bit [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3103.02s)]
*  People who think RFK has some good ideas a [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3107.5s)]
*  Little bit a little bit. What do you think? What do you like? What is the appeal there? Cranks just cranks? Yeah anti-establishment cranks [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3110.94s)]
*  There's a lot of them. There's the the Tulsi Gabbard [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3118.94s)]
*  Constituency, which is like marginal. It's not all that significant [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3123.1s)]
*  But but yeah, I think that the the online left is not as robust a media ecosystem as like people think it is in [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3127.14s)]
*  General and besides that they don't have any sort of like political motion regardless, right? [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3134.6s)]
*  I am you know, I have disagreements with [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3140.48s)]
*  the the closest Congress members [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3144.64s)]
*  That are ideologically as close a lot closely aligned with myself as possible, but I still have many disagreements with them [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3147.64s)]
*  And and outside of that I think [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3154.4s)]
*  Like these guys that you know, like RFK jr. Because they think he's gonna make America healthy again [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3157.72s)]
*  You know, they're just they just like the crank stuff. Yeah, that's what it is [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3163.84s)]
*  I mean, you know you talked to like when I'm really like four years or eight years ago Jesus [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3167.44s)]
*  I remember like after Trump won the first time what I was feeling at the time, which I'm still feeling now is [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3174.12s)]
*  that [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3179.92s)]
*  Like the two challenges right is that like at a moment where someone like Trump is ascendant [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3181.92s)]
*  Like how do you keep this big? [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3187.72s)]
*  this big [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3191.04s)]
*  Left-together this big tent together from [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3193.64s)]
*  Yes, it includes the kind of pro-democracy [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3196.72s)]
*  anti-trump right runs all the way to [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3199.48s)]
*  the far left and like and and left us [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3203.3199999999997s)]
*  How do you keep that big group of people together? [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3207.16s)]
*  And I do think like you're right like there is just in part because there's just so much money behind it [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3209.24s)]
*  like the online right is I think it's it's bigger and [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3213.7999999999997s)]
*  More influential but it also [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3218.7599999999998s)]
*  Knows how to get on board right like it knows like it fights it has disagreements it pushes [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3221.48s)]
*  But then it knows like for our ends for our goals. We all need to get behind [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3226.32s)]
*  Whether it's Trump or in previous elections [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3231.6000000000004s)]
*  It was getting behind like Romney like figures McCain like feet like they get behind those figures and sometimes it feels like on the on the left [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3234.2000000000003s)]
*  like the [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3240.48s)]
*  Like the [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3243.4s)]
*  There's no moment at which we say. All right, we've had the fight [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3245.0800000000004s)]
*  We've had the we've had we've had the debate we disagree on a whole bunch of stuff. Hey everybody [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3248.96s)]
*  We're gonna get together. We're gonna make sure that we stop Donald Trump [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3253.2400000000002s)]
*  We elect Joe Biden as much as we let Kamala Harris like that moment doesn't come and like I'm not saying that [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3256.48s)]
*  Democrats in power aren't in part responsible for that [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3263.84s)]
*  I think part of what we need to do is figure out a politics that brings people in but it is it does require [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3266.2400000000002s)]
*  It does like everyone is responsible. Yeah, I think [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3274.28s)]
*  Just as I was very critical of Bernie Sanders his campaign despite, you know still loving Bernie [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3278.82s)]
*  because he was nowhere near as aggressive as he could have been in the primaries and and and it you know, [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3284.86s)]
*  Definitely should have probably gone on more like independent media route in a similar vein to Donald Trump. I [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3293.6600000000003s)]
*  Am still because I blame the fault on Bernie's campaign strategies in the primaries [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3302.38s)]
*  despite recognizing the the [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3308.6200000000003s)]
*  structural hurdles of like a left-wing popular populace coming out of a [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3311.54s)]
*  Democratic Party primary where it's like the laser focused audience that goes out and votes at those things are like the MSNBC [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3317.3s)]
*  Watcher base that is like objectively terrified of someone like that because people are saying he's gonna you know start executing wealthy people [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3323.46s)]
*  That's still it's still his fault and it's still the campaign's fault in this regard as well [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3330.34s)]
*  And that's why I brought forward the point that like you can have a billion point five, right? Mm-hmm [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3334.98s)]
*  You can have ground game [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3339.58s)]
*  None of that matters if the message is not [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3341.7400000000002s)]
*  actually addressing the real issues that Americans are facing and the reason why I think the Republicans can [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3344.7400000000002s)]
*  You know go out and vote for the Republican Party and and don't usually sit it out [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3351.02s)]
*  I guess and and instead are able to say suck it up and say yeah, we're still gonna vote for Donald Trump is because [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3356.18s)]
*  There there are single issue voters out there and in Trump [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3364.02s)]
*  They know that Trump is gonna protect it people that like guns are gonna be like I like my guns [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3367.46s)]
*  I want my guns to be protected. I want to be able to marry my gun [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3371.7000000000003s)]
*  I want to be able to have sex with my gun [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3374.6200000000003s)]
*  I know Donald Trump is gonna be the guy that lets that happen and I know the Democrats are gonna [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3376.6200000000003s)]
*  You know shun me for wanting to have sex with my gun. So that guy is gonna go and vote for Trump regardless, right? [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3380.94s)]
*  On the other side though if your top-line communication your major policy prescriptions are like [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3388.18s)]
*  We have to preserve these institutions [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3394.8599999999997s)]
*  We have to preserve civility and we have to preserve democracy at a time when Americans are like [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3396.8199999999997s)]
*  I don't give a fuck about democracy just lower the price of eggs [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3400.74s)]
*  Then you're not [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3404.1s)]
*  There's no way that I could [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3406.9399999999996s)]
*  Outflank the Democratic Party and get people to to vote for Kamala Harris [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3410.06s)]
*  That [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3415.34s)]
*  That you know in a way that that sticks in a way that is going to be successful [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3416.34s)]
*  No matter how much influence I I wield besides. Yeah, I'm not even just talking about [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3422.26s)]
*  Yes [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3427.42s)]
*  Take your point. Most people are just not voting. That's the problem, but but [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3429.02s)]
*  The the challenge right is it like there are like these three. Let's say you say there's these three kind of media ecosystems [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3432.7400000000002s)]
*  There's the right-wing one. There's a kind of mainstream one and there's the left-wing is the left one the one on the right [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3439.6200000000003s)]
*  is [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3444.8599999999997s)]
*  built to attack Democrats [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3446.06s)]
*  The one in the middle is built to attack Washington and politics and the one on the left is built to attack Democrats [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3447.74s)]
*  It is I mean like I don't I think they're trying to pressure Democrats to be a more moral and just version of itself [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3453.2999999999997s)]
*  I think I probably spend more time shitting on the Republican Party than the Democratic Party [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3459.52s)]
*  But yeah [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3463.8599999999997s)]
*  I but I'm saying when we're talking about like when the right is talking when when right-wing media it is trying to be a [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3464.22s)]
*  Team player and it is attacking Democrats and supporting Republicans [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3469.9399999999996s)]
*  The middle is attacking both and the left is attacking Democrats and Republicans. There is no place right? [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3473.18s)]

*  Trying to solve some of the problems in America at least [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3539.84s)]
*  The point is not that I'm rich the point is that [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3544.36s)]
*  The point I'm making is that like I I [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3548.88s)]
*  Care about my fellow Americans. I care about them their lives getting better [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3552.2400000000002s)]
*  they're they're improving their material conditions and I [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3557.68s)]
*  Recognize that if Democrats keep losing then Republicans are gonna keep ruining this country further and I want the Democrats to win [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3563.2s)]
*  I want to be the most regime-pilled [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3570.44s)]
*  Yeah propaganda minister you've ever seen what I want for you, but I can't do that if the Democratic Party is not offering anything [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3572.64s)]
*  I I guess what I here's what I and I I think that's all fair [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3579.24s)]
*  I guess like where I'm like what I'm trying to see is like what is the path to [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3582.8799999999997s)]
*  the Democrats creating the kind of [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3586.88s)]
*  story that's backed by [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3590.32s)]
*  Candidates that's backed by message that's backed by policy that's backed by having the right enemies [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3592.64s)]
*  Telling that kind of story right and then in concert with that [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3597.84s)]
*  like it is a kind of like to go we do need a kind of like virtuous circle where then more and more people in [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3601.32s)]
*  left media [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3608.64s)]
*  Start to accept that the the vehicle for changing this country for the better is the Democratic Party if we were consistently [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3610.36s)]
*  I mean, I can't speak for everybody else on the left [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3618.2000000000003s)]
*  I don't know who you're talking about when you say this but like I can speak to my friends [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3620.44s)]
*  That are over at drop site news former intercept guys like Jeremy Scahill and Ryan Grimm [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3623.8s)]
*  I can speak to majority report that was way more in the tank for Kamala than I was for sure like they were very openly [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3629.28s)]
*  More excited at the prospect of Kamala Harris. I was definitely a lot more depressed by no matter who wins. We are still cooked [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3636.52s)]
*  Was my attitude but like certainly understanding and recognizing that John Trump's gonna be far worse than Kamala Harris, of course [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3644.28s)]
*  and and [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3652.12s)]
*  Chapa trap house, right? [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3654.12s)]
*  So these are some of the largest media companies out there on the left right outside of the orbit of the Democratic Party [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3655.56s)]
*  Every single one of these outlets myself included [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3662.88s)]
*  Talked more about the Biden administration's accomplishments with the NLRB with Lena con at the FTC with like, you know [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3668.48s)]
*  Trust-busting and and numerous other accomplishments that the Democratic Party actually brought forward [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3674.68s)]
*  Then they did and it didn't matter. My point is well, there was we always defended [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3681.96s)]
*  We always defended we always always defended the Afghan withdrawal [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3687.2s)]
*  Unconditionally, you never saw that on even you barely saw that on MSNBC. We always defended that we always defended Lena con [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3692.6s)]
*  We always defended the NLRB [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3699.44s)]
*  We always defended the the walking this symbolic move that Joe Biden made when he went to the UAW picket line [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3701.24s)]
*  We didn't forget that we talked about that. It didn't matter [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3707.72s)]
*  It's not enough, especially when there is a [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3712.7999999999997s)]
*  There's so much that Joe Biden did I think? [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3717.24s)]
*  outside of the the [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3720.72s)]
*  the [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3722.92s)]
*  Economic pressures that Americans were experiencing that was certainly going to play a pivotal role in the election [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3724.24s)]
*  But there's so much that he did in the month of October in 2023 that just completely wiped that that made it [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3730.0s)]
*  impossible to defend him because it became the the major focus of a lot of people and [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3736.96s)]
*  There's not like [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3744.0s)]
*  There's nothing you can do in that moment when people are you know seeing exactly what's going on and getting frustrated [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3746.6s)]
*  He unveiled the right-wing immigration bill [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3751.84s)]
*  on October 5th 2023 [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3755.36s)]
*  If I'm I might be getting the date wrong, but it was like literally two days before October 7 [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3757.96s)]
*  He did that and then October 7 happened and he went any bear hugged in Yahoo and and kept giving you know [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3762.2s)]
*  Unlimited weapons to Israel over and over again never restraining Israel [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3769.92s)]
*  Everybody knew exactly what was going to happen it had happened before and it was going to be much worse and [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3774.04s)]
*  And yet no restraint whatsoever and it it has I think diminished America's soft power capabilities on the global stage [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3779.64s)]
*  Further it has eroded America's [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3788.56s)]
*  Influence and and soft power capabilities in the Western world. Obviously the global south already knew what was up [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3791.3999999999996s)]
*  They've always known but they have no power. They have no voice [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3797.24s)]
*  It doesn't matter but the populations in Western Europe [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3800.08s)]
*  Recognizing what was going on and actually starting to protest against it. I mean that's different [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3805.36s)]
*  I'm saying this is someone who's been an advocate for Palestinian emancipation for the past ten years publicly [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3809.98s)]
*  I've never seen this groundswell of this this this massive sea change this this [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3816.0s)]
*  attitude shift in such a dramatic fashion over the course of the last 12 months and they did not address that at all and [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3821.6s)]
*  Instead they hugged and kissed neo-cons and [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3827.92s)]
*  talked about even in the VP debate like [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3831.0800000000004s)]
*  Israel having the nuclear first strike capability. What an insane conversation we're having after 12 months of genocide like that's you know Americans [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3833.84s)]
*  Fancy themselves to be [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3842.84s)]
*  Peaceful people it's a lie [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3845.6000000000004s)]
*  America's foreign interventions are anything but peaceful and [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3848.1200000000003s)]
*  but [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3853.36s)]
*  Even then the media ecosystem usually just shelters Americans from the genuine devastating impact of America's actions globally [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3854.4s)]
*  But for that reason Americans can at least feel like they're peaceful does which is why Donald Trump [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3861.56s)]
*  despite never being a peaceful dove mm-hmm was able to [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3866.96s)]
*  Effectively communicate that he was actually anti-iraq war against Hillary Clinton in 2016 [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3871.12s)]
*  Which was a resilient message that actually showcased them as more moderate than Hillary Clinton in the eyes of many Americans [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3875.56s)]
*  He did four years of no peaceful dove shit whatsoever [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3882.62s)]
*  And then he turned around and after October 7 was still able to effectively [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3886.84s)]
*  outflank the Democrats on this issue despite the fact that he got a hundred million dollars from Miriam Adelson Sheldon Adelson's wife to [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3892.74s)]
*  potentially annex the West Bank and put [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3901.54s)]
*  rabid [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3904.9s)]
*  evangelical pharix like Mike Huckabee [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3906.46s)]
*  Yes, the is the you know Israeli ambassador like these guys are insane [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3909.7400000000002s)]
*  It's why it's like it is like it's like very heartbreaking for me, too [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3914.6600000000003s)]
*  Like like look like I think one of the reasons people will be mad that you're on the show is because you're like a proud [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3917.9s)]
*  Anti-zionist right like you said that I've gotten shit for saying anti-semi. I was like damn [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3924.5800000000004s)]
*  Joining us today anti-semi dumbass [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3930.1800000000003s)]
*  No, but that but like I actually like a couple like two or three years ago [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3933.1800000000003s)]
*  I [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3938.46s)]
*  said on Pond State of America like that I described myself as a [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3939.62s)]
*  Zionist which got people upset too [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3944.06s)]
*  but what I what I said then and what I still say now is and I actually the same conversation with Bernie is like [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3946.84s)]
*  you like you ought to denounce the [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3953.62s)]
*  Destruction and death in Gaza you ought to denounce the moral [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3958.58s)]
*  Abomination that is [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3966.42s)]
*  Taking over the West Bank on its own terms because it is morally reprehensible. Yeah, it is [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3968.46s)]
*  Despicable it is [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3974.34s)]
*  It is [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3976.5s)]
*  These are war crimes being committed against innocent Palestinians who are paying with their lives [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3977.9s)]
*  for the the crimes of Hamas and [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3985.5s)]
*  Like you don't need to go further than that what I'm saying is it is also terrible for [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3992.46s)]
*  Israel and you don't need to care about that. No, I agree. No, I know and and that and like I [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=3996.4599999999996s)]
*  what Bernie said I like I [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4002.3799999999997s)]
*  Always appreciate what he has to say on this issue when he said is that basically even Israel does not understand the way in [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4004.54s)]
*  Which they're becoming an isolated pariah. Yeah nation and so I like [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4009.18s)]
*  like people will be mad to have someone who is a self-proclaimed anti-zionist on this show [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4014.02s)]
*  But like I am someone who has called himself a Zionist and I am against this because I believe it doesn't serve [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4020.1s)]
*  Israel's interest either and that to me is what is so devastating about the outcome of this election in part because of policy in part [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4025.9s)]
*  because Joe Biden is such an like kind of [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4032.2599999999998s)]
*  Incomprehensible messenger. I'm one of the most delicate and and and contentious topics in American politics [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4035.5s)]
*  we now have Donald Trump who was able to kind of [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4042.34s)]
*  Allied what his actual views would be on this issue and like [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4047.14s)]
*  You know, we have we have seen what happens in Israel when you have someone like Trump in power at a moment of crisis [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4051.22s)]
*  And now there is Trump back in office here [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4057.5s)]
*  And if you are concerned about the lives of Palestinians if you're concerned about continuing instability and violence and death [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4060.02s)]
*  In that region this election has just made everything so much fucking worse [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4066.46s)]
*  American foreign policy being so uniparty on this issue is [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4072.02s)]
*  Genuinely frustrating and it's genuinely damaging for Israel because [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4075.9s)]
*  We recognize how our fellow Americans are becoming more reactionary every single day, especially with this new Trump election [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4080.7400000000002s)]
*  You see people that formerly maybe had different opinions go. You know what? [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4087.44s)]
*  Maybe it is good to deport 20 million people. Yeah violently by by utilizing the military potentially [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4091.58s)]
*  This is something that the Donald Trump administration has said they're gonna do [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4098.78s)]
*  At the very least even if people don't believe that'll happen or didn't understand like these things are not there these things are not like [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4101.36s)]
*  The expectation that Donald Trump taking all these extreme positions would be enough. Yeah wasn't that just wasn't true. Yeah, so I [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4107.4s)]
*  What I'm trying to explain here is that [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4116.0s)]
*  Before you know it [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4119.32s)]
*  people can succumb to [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4121.24s)]
*  reactionary feelings and reactionary sentiment and find themselves in the throes of a fascist ideology without even [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4123.4s)]
*  Recognizing it and I think examining that is important in an academic setting. That's why we have Holocaust studies, right? [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4129.96s)]
*  That's why we have genocide studies as an entire field to specifically understand exactly how [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4136.160000000001s)]
*  Nazi Germany got to that position or fascist Italy got to the position that it got to and [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4141.84s)]
*  And I think that you know, you might even disagree with me on this but like that's where Israel is [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4146.92s)]
*  that's where Israel is at right now, they have become a [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4153.08s)]
*  Incredibly angry an incredibly angry culture an incredibly angry country that is [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4156.88s)]
*  As has succumb especially since the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin who wasn't exactly a great guy for Palestinians either [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4164.76s)]
*  I mean he was known as the guy who [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4172.4800000000005s)]
*  deliberately tasked Israeli security forces and breaking the hands of children for [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4175.16s)]
*  For you know stone for stone throwing right in the first Intifada [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4179.280000000001s)]
*  That guy was the like off-ramp for for peace negotiations with Palestinians and they assassinated him and his assassins and [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4183.8s)]
*  People who are backing his assassins like itamar ben givir [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4193.08s)]
*  Like Bezilla small trich are now [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4196.6s)]
*  firmly a part of the Israeli [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4199.72s)]
*  Establishment the the the current Israeli government. Yeah. Well, I also there are also hundreds of thousands of [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4203.320000000001s)]
*  Israelis who have protested this government. Yeah for different reasons, but yeah, no for sure. Yes and [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4210.2s)]
*  again like I [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4217.2s)]
*  Just think it's important [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4219.8s)]
*  yes, like [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4221.8s)]
*  Israel is responsible for Israel's actions, but we do need to separate Benjamin Netanyahu and his conduct from [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4224.5599999999995s)]
*  The Israeli people in the same that doesn't mean they're not responsible in the same way that [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4231.76s)]
*  America is not George W Bush, right but America is responsible for what George W [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4236.04s)]
*  Bush yeah when he is in command of our armed forces yet, but we understand that distinction [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4240.879999999999s)]
*  It's it no no, of course [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4245.5599999999995s)]
*  The problem is you have to also look at the Overton window though in in any society in any culture in any country [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4247.5599999999995s)]
*  right, and I think that [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4254.66s)]
*  And I come from I'm Turkish like I come from a country with it with a conscription [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4256.639999999999s)]
*  Like I I understand how what ultra nationalism is I've lived through it. I've experienced it [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4262.32s)]
*  I know what it's like when Turkish people hear me say like that the Armenian genocide is real for example [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4268.36s)]
*  Like that's like a non-starter, right? That's like you can't say that. What are you talking about? [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4273.5199999999995s)]
*  I learned in school that it wasn't real right like I I [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4276.84s)]
*  understand how a country can become more and more right-wing where even the liberal position is still [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4281.08s)]
*  Committed to the maintenance of an apartheid and [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4289.44s)]
*  and I think that [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4294.16s)]
*  That is where we're at with with Israel and we have to restrain Israel as as we are the number one partner of Israel [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4296.4s)]
*  whether it be [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4304.599999999999s)]
*  The the weapons that we give to Israel whether it be the financial support that we give to Israel or whether it be [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4305.96s)]
*  the the trade partnership that we have or you know the the financial [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4311.36s)]
*  Partnership that we have with Israeli companies [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4316.679999999999s)]
*  We have a lot of influence over what Israel does and I think over the course of the last couple decades [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4319.28s)]
*  especially with Benjamin Netanyahu [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4325.12s)]
*  Israel has become a more and more right-wing nation. Yes, it is a country that now views itself as being isolated and under siege [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4328.32s)]
*  right, yeah, like all of this is like we have moved in the wrong direction in a bunch of [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4335.84s)]
*  like this is all [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4341.96s)]
*  Gotten to be so kind of hopeless [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4344.24s)]
*  Israel faces recrimination from around the world feels isolated feels like it needs to turn inward to protect itself views itself as being [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4346.56s)]
*  Attack. Well, it's like the question right to me is like, how do you break that cycle? I agree requires a ton of American [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4355.12s)]
*  pressure, but it also I think like the turn like anti-zionist fervor [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4362.8s)]
*  Like to me like anti-zionism itself is not a path to where we ultimately need to go which is a [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4368.8s)]
*  Peace peace and the Palestinian self-determination, right? Like that's like that's what I believe in like that's what I care about [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4375.64s)]
*  That's where I want this like like Israel [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4381.92s)]
*  Israel as a country that no longer feels [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4385.04s)]
*  constantly under threat Palestinians being able to live in peace and safety [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4387.88s)]
*  Without being under occupation [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4393.64s)]
*  in control of their own destiny and to me like that like it's become a kind like that is a two-state solution and [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4395.4s)]
*  Anything that drives towards that I think is is ultimately the rectory to go right now [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4402.2s)]
*  We're moving in the opposite direction, which is why this all feels so hopeless. Yeah. Well, I mean look [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4405.96s)]
*  I used to be of that same mindset [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4409.88s)]
*  Maybe like a decade ago as well where I [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4413.84s)]
*  I [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4417.2s)]
*  Resort to the likes of Avi Schleem on this or Elon Pabe on this in terms of like my analysis of it [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4418.52s)]
*  But like the settlement operations in the so-called peace process [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4424.160000000001s)]
*  That were again funded by America as well and still funded to this day by like the likes of goofy Christians United for Israel [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4428.64s)]
*  which is the the the oftentimes not talked about part of this equation that is [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4436.06s)]
*  significant and dare I say more significant than [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4442.400000000001s)]
*  Than whatever Jewish Americans think about Israel like it's the right-wing evangelical Christians that are [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4445.679999999999s)]
*  the number one funders of the settlement project, but it's also like [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4453.36s)]
*  No consequences for the expansion of settlements. Yeah [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4457.44s)]
*  well that and the use of settlement like that what was once expanding settlements as part of a negotiation tactics [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4460.24s)]
*  Tactic towards what would ultimately have been a solution is now just a plan to take over the West Bank. Yeah [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4467.24s)]
*  No, it's it's developing bantustans, which they did and my point is [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4471.96s)]
*  That that has made it virtually impossible for a two-state solution to exist [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4476.24s)]
*  Which is why I think that like Israel already maintains sovereignty and that as an apartheid state [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4480.96s)]
*  What needs to happen is to abolish the apartheid which is something that unfortunately many Israelis [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4485.28s)]
*  Refused to reckon with at least right now [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4492.88s)]
*  Because they that would mean five million Palestinians [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4495.72s)]
*  And including the 2.5 million Palestinian citizens of Israel would now constitute a demographic majority in this area in this [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4499.92s)]
*  in this land that Israel enforces sovereignty over and that is terrifying for [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4508.08s)]
*  Its its demographic destiny its demographic goals in general. Well, just also it's it [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4513.16s)]
*  Like okay, that's something to add like you can point like it's also me that Israel is never going to ascend to no [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4519.759999999999s)]
*  I understand that which is why which is why I think like the pressure campaigns albeit [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4526.98s)]
*  you know minimal but the the the change in attitude in the way that like a lot of people see this dynamic is is [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4532.54s)]
*  significant and I think that [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4540.78s)]
*  inevitably [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4542.5s)]
*  Inevitably things will change and we're seeing it right now. We're seeing it with the ICC decision [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4544.78s)]
*  Like this is this is a truly unique moment. We're seeing it with the ICJ court case [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4549.0599999999995s)]
*  We'll see where it goes, but I think that I [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4554.6s)]
*  Understand why even members in the State Department that I would directly be at odds with in the way that we examine the world [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4558.84s)]
*  Have have from the start [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4566.8s)]
*  Tried to say this can't happen that we need to use the liberal Zionist off-ramp immediately [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4569.4800000000005s)]
*  We need to just like, you know put [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4575.280000000001s)]
*  Benny Gantz in charge or something like we need to just like single out Benjamin and Yahoo [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4578.32s)]
*  Say he's the bad guy and then move in the direction where [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4582.48s)]
*  move in the direction where like a more [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4586.759999999999s)]
*  manageable more liberal person a more moderate person can be be left responsible and and and restrain Israel in some way in order to [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4589.839999999999s)]
*  continue [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4599.4s)]
*  Israel being an unsinkable aircraft carrier in a resource-rich region and and they didn't even listen to that like [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4601.12s)]
*  Because it was a top of the administration just didn't even listen to that well because Netanyahu is an obstacle to any kind of peace [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4607.44s)]
*  I mean, this is a like we have been on the we have been in moments in the recent past where [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4612.92s)]
*  We're Palestinians and Israelis were at the table and peace seemed within reach, right? [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4618.96s)]
*  And that seems very far away right we were we were we were and that seems very far away right now [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4622.92s)]
*  but and but to me that still seems closer than a [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4628.5199999999995s)]
*  Than a single state and to me there's that that in that sort of a [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4633.6s)]
*  future of heading towards that is a future of a lot more chaos and [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4639.160000000001s)]
*  violence and terror and horror and [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4643.120000000001s)]
*  No, and so I like come back to my my view remains that like the the future that they the only hope is some kind [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4646.56s)]
*  Of a two-state solution as far as that seems right now people want to say otherwise fine [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4654.04s)]
*  But I think they're gonna I think they're gonna annex the the West Bank. I think that's what I think is gonna happen, but [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4660.6s)]
*  Let's move we got we got it. We got it [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4667.84s)]
*  And Trump's gonna let it happen like trauma. This is the thing like and and it's not even because Trump is like [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4669.76s)]
*  Ideologically committed to design his project in the way that like Joe Biden was it's because Mary Maddelson gave him a hundred million dollars [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4675.6s)]
*  That's it. He's a fuck. Yeah. He doesn't give a shit about anything. He's just like yeah [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4682.0s)]
*  These guys gave me money [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4687.400000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna I'm gonna listen to her and that's it and that was really funny because like that's what he's talked about in [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4689.160000000001s)]
*  The in the anti-semitism conference that he put together if you recall he was like I've done so much for you Jews [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4694.320000000001s)]
*  Why won't you vote for me? That's what he kept saying. He's like if I lose it because I know I know [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4700.320000000001s)]
*  And it was insane because like in his mind [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4704.64s)]
*  He thinks that's the only thing that American Jews care about like it's the it's the dual loyalty trope [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4707.84s)]
*  But you also can't do that trope in a woke way on mainstream media either when you are, you know [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4715.4s)]
*  Not I'm not saying you're doing this [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4721.96s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just saying like you also can't do that in a in a more woke way when you're talking about Israel [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4723.16s)]
*  In as many liberal outlets do sometimes when they talk about like well, you know, you just want Israel to perish [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4728.32s)]
*  I think and you're probably anti-semitic and that [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4734.92s)]
*  you know [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4738.5599999999995s)]
*  It's just Israel has demographic concerns. It's like okay. Well, that's [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4740.5599999999995s)]

*  But like it's just that you see it in our politics [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4766.84s)]
*  you see it in politics around Israel like this kind of vicious circle of [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4769.16s)]
*  People feel under threat they turn inward [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4773.52s)]
*  They become less and less empathetic towards their neighbors that leads them to be more and more isolated [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4776.400000000001s)]
*  And you know me it's like the question is not like I like I don't like I'm not even interested in like philosophical [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4783.240000000001s)]
*  Debates ideologically is like how do you break that human cycle? Right and [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4789.68s)]
*  I think on our side it starts with just a [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4795.320000000001s)]
*  like a [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4800.280000000001s)]
*  policy that right like that recognizes that even if [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4802.36s)]
*  That it is in Israel's interest to stop the violence and to stop the killing and that moving towards something like the annexation of [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4806.84s)]
*  the West Bank or [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4813.5599999999995s)]
*  The permanent occupation of Gaza or whatever it may be is ultimately not in Israel's interest [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4814.8s)]

*  No, I understand where you're coming from. I I don't disagree with you [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4823.679999999999s)]
*  I think that that's why I was trying to bring it back to like American politics and and [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4826.759999999999s)]
*  I don't think it's an accident that in the past three decades [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4831.599999999999s)]

*  dramatically to the right and [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4853.2s)]
*  In that process I think or leading up to that there was a lot of austerity a lot of clawing back of social safety nets [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4855.16s)]
*  a lot of [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4862.5599999999995s)]

*  and in that process, I think people got more and more angry and [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4871.36s)]
*  the only people that benefit from that anger are [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=4876.5599999999995s)]

*  Of like hey, we traded something away to these corporations and some of it we did unwillingly some of it [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5131.6s)]
*  We did willingly but we're not happy with the outcome and I do think that that's about community [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5137.56s)]

*  But like yes, you're right Americans feel isolated. Everyone feels isolated. Everyone feels alienated. They feel alienated from their labor and [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5153.599999999999s)]
*  and and besides that there is no there is no sense of identity and [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5160.259999999999s)]
*  I talked about this quite frequently actually our [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5164.78s)]

*  That's it. That's no different than an expensive Gucci bag. Okay, it's actually more expensive in many instances and the culture that surrounds it is still [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5176.219999999999s)]
*  ultimately at the point of consumption and when [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5184.46s)]
*  when there is a [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5187.82s)]
*  hurdle in front of that whether it's cost or because you just simply can't go and and buy it at the store or whatever during [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5189.379999999999s)]

*  The other side is what I was trying to say is this is what this is what Kamala Harris did wrong in my opinion [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5226.4s)]
*  She she could have gone up there and said I am going to arrest the Walton family [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5230.599999999999s)]

*  $5 cheaper it's gonna be eggs are gonna be ten cents again [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5248.0s)]

*  small L liberal movement together the other is [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5267.78s)]
*  How you defend the value of institutions that don't do that and like I know you're being [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5271.58s)]
*  I'm [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5277.860000000001s)]
*  Exaggerating I know you are I know you are I know you are I think that for far too long, you know [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5280.14s)]
*  deregulation and and [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5286.660000000001s)]
*  Unconditionally supporting corporations and even having what you just described as like the the formative opinion on antitrust [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5289.740000000001s)]
*  Like as long as the consumer is happy as long as the prices are low. We don't care if you monopolize [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5295.18s)]
*  That's the right that's the right view [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5299.62s)]
*  I mean we like Democrats are now fight fight like nobody this is like we're fighting back on that stuff [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5301.14s)]
*  So that was the that was the right view but that was kind of uniparty for a very long time [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5305.1s)]
*  I think the right I think the the but this is like this is I think [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5310.06s)]
*  Conservatives had an ideological view of this. Yeah, the Bork view of this they came in and they said antitrust doesn't mean what it says [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5314.54s)]
*  In the law, it doesn't mean what it says in people's experience of what a monopoly does [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5321.5s)]
*  It's this one specific definition which makes it really hard to stop mergers and Democrats said wait [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5325.4400000000005s)]
*  Hold on like kind of Democrats just didn't have a strong view on this. It just wasn't a motivating [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5329.9800000000005s)]
*  It wasn't it wasn't about why why didn't well, I think they first of I think there wasn't I think that like I think the [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5334.14s)]
*  intellectual academic [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5340.700000000001s)]
*  Left had to catch up to the damage this was doing. I think Democrats just didn't focus on it didn't care about it [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5343.5s)]
*  I also think there is money from donors. Of course, of course, I'm not I know you know you do rhetorically cue me up [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5349.42s)]
*  I know I know but but that's like I think sometimes it is I think it is not people saying [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5354.700000000001s)]
*  Oh, I wish we would go after these giant monopolies more but I got this donation [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5359.38s)]
*  So no now I'm not but it's a culture a kind of pro-business [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5362.82s)]
*  Culture right that like kind of pervaded Democrats since the 90s that made [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5366.82s)]
*  Conversations about this kind of thing harder to have which is different now because Lena Kahn is now the chair of the FTC [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5371.98s)]
*  Right Elizabeth Warren created this consumer financial protection Bureau, right? [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5377.16s)]
*  Like there has been a shift but it but it is both a not enough and not a shift in people's actual [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5381.219999999999s)]
*  understanding of what the Democratic Party is [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5388.299999999999s)]
*  There's no immediate gratification that comes from that I know and the immediate gratification that that is supposed to happen could happen potentially with [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5390.3s)]
*  wide-sweeping legislative agenda changes overall or like [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5399.66s)]
*  Clearly communicating a pathway towards like a more just outcome for health care [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5403.54s)]
*  For example, like that's not something that we're invested in like things that touch people's lives immediately is [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5407.78s)]
*  Going to yield very positive benefits. I will say this I think [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5413.820000000001s)]
*  As far as as far as like Lena Kahn or the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5420.62s)]
*  These are these are fantastic things. Yeah that happened under the you know, the watchful eye of the Biden regime [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5427.78s)]
*  Well, but Barack Obama and and Barack Obama as well [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5433.62s)]
*  the problem here, however, is that [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5437.3s)]
*  once again, I [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5440.58s)]
*  Think out of genuine fear maybe that they would dis they would disrupt or upset [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5442.62s)]
*  The Tony West coalition of the Democratic Party all of these like major donors that donate to the Democratic Party [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5449.0s)]
*  They didn't do a good job even explaining what they were doing and I'll tell you why I'm just real quick [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5459.48s)]
*  I just want to give you an example of the IRS, right? [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5464.799999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden funded the IRS every dollar that goes to the IRS [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5468.679999999999s)]
*  I think is like what seven extra dollars or 30 up to 35 if I'm not mistaken [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5472.4s)]
*  I don't know the exact numbers but like every dollar you spend on the IRS you get 35 in return and in America's coffers, right? [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5476.84s)]
*  Mm-hmm. That's massive. That's fantastic [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5482.8s)]
*  Republicans hate that. Yeah, they hate the IRS and and many Americans also hate the IRS as well. They hate paying taxes [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5487.56s)]
*  partially because they get they don't see anything in return for it and [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5494.32s)]
*  Even though the IRS [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5500.56s)]
*  Getting more funds actually retrieved a lot of you know [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5502.6s)]
*  tax dodgers that were refusing to pay taxes and on top of that their investigations concluded that I think Coca-Cola was [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5506.580000000001s)]
*  Was was had avoided or had evaded taxes to the tune of 16 billion dollars, right one company. Mm-hmm [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5515.200000000001s)]
*  I never heard that from the Biden administration. They never went out. They never went out and said this is why we funded the IRS [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5521.64s)]
*  Not because we want to come after you and your and your trailer [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5528.1s)]
*  Okay in the trailer park with our armed agents or whatever Republicans on the other hand [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5532.22s)]

*  Communicator in the president like I think we paid to leave. It's not just the president [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5550.1s)]

*  So a lot of every every television show [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5556.46s)]
*  I think I do doing part of the challenges a lot of people are talking about what these agents would actually do it [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5559.42s)]
*  Just doesn't get cover doesn't get attention. Just doesn't matter people don't cover this kind of stuff. That's a pop [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5563.14s)]
*  That's part of it. I'm not saying there aren't Democrats [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5566.900000000001s)]

*  Like that's anything we take away from Donald Trump becoming president is that like clearly we need somebody people want a fighter [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5574.26s)]
*  They want a fighter they want a fighter and like and you can't fight for opportunity economy and $50,000 in tax credits for startups [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5579.9s)]
*  That is not something to fight for you need to be a fighter and you need to fight for [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5587.099999999999s)]

*  Rigidity of my schedule my regimen and I don't even think about it because it's just a habit that I have at this point and [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5835.36s)]
*  For that reason it's not even a thing. I think about it all it doesn't weigh on me. But when I was [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5842.36s)]
*  You know when I was eating in a very unhealthy way [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5848.32s)]
*  It did constantly weigh on me. I was like, yeah, but it feels so good [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5852.08s)]
*  Also, it's so bad for me, but then you know, you get that a little bit hopeless. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's true politics, too [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5856.2s)]
*  For sure. I mean definitely but you know, you got it [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5863.28s)]
*  you got to focus on whatever small victory you can have and it's the same for fitness and [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5866.32s)]
*  like I said going back to the Joe Rogan of the left conversation I [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5871.36s)]
*  You know, this is definitely something that I talked to [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5875.38s)]
*  My community about quite a bit and there's a lot of people in my community that have also gone on their own fitness journey [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5878.8s)]
*  I've been able to inspire them to to do this as well [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5883.72s)]
*  and I think it's it's important to to be well physically healthy I do like just to make what just to close this out because [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5886.240000000001s)]
*  we've gone on too long, but like [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5891.68s)]
*  there is something about [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5893.52s)]
*  like [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5895.52s)]
*  like in terms of meaning and like a spiritual cry like I [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5897.240000000001s)]
*  think there's there's a reason that that there's been an appeal of people like the Jordan Petersons of the world and some of the [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5901.04s)]
*  kind of more like [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5907.360000000001s)]
*  Right-wing types. Yeah, and like I do think there are a lot of people out there looking for [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5909.36s)]
*  Not just sort of answers in politics [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5916.56s)]
*  But like answers about like why does like I feel unfulfilled working not working whatever it may be like I feel like I'm missing [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5918.84s)]
*  like [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5926.8s)]
*  Community and the kind of leadership that would come from community and like I don't think that I do think that's why sometimes you see [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5928.72s)]
*  like I don't know like [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5934.74s)]
*  Even unlike the shows we do like I do feel like there's like a hunger for like something broader than just a political program [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5937.179999999999s)]
*  but like more of a kind of way of grappling with [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5942.94s)]
*  the fact that this version of [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5947.58s)]
*  Modern life kind of dares us to ruin our own lives. Yeah, you know, I [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5950.58s)]
*  Offered that [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5957.42s)]
*  In in my broadcast every day [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5958.58s)]
*  I mean I talk about my own personal journeys and I offer advice [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5960.7s)]
*  I used to have an advice segment as well. I haven't done it in a while, but like, you know [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5965.44s)]
*  I'm gonna bring it back and [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5969.839999999999s)]
*  That's why I also like collaborate with other content creators [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5971.28s)]
*  Even if I don't align with them politically agree with them politically at all [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5973.599999999999s)]
*  But you know [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5976.4s)]
*  There are plenty of people that I know who are my friends who I think as long as they're like relatively charitable and good and kind people [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5977.879999999999s)]
*  Even if we don't agree on everything politically, it doesn't matter [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5984.5199999999995s)]
*  and and you know, I [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5987.599999999999s)]
*  Find myself in these bro spaces a lot [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5990.12s)]
*  I've been on every single almost every single podcast that Trump has been on [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5992.0s)]
*  Yeah, and and many of them are are run by my friends like impulsive [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5995.12s)]
*  My buddy Mike Malak is is Logan Paul's goes not the biggest fan of Logan Paul, but I love Mike [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=5999.72s)]
*  Mike is a fantastic human being he has an incredible journey of overcoming [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6004.96s)]
*  addiction and [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6010.4800000000005s)]
*  And he wrote about it as well. He had a New York Times bestseller Bradley Martin with the Nelk boys [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6012.0s)]
*  I don't really know the Nelk boys, but like Bradley Martin. I like a lot. He owns zoo culture [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6016.8s)]
*  He's a real meathead and [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6020.8s)]
*  and [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6023.04s)]
*  That's the and Andrew Schultz as well [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6024.320000000001s)]
*  I've been on that podcast too like these are a lot of these pockets [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6026.400000000001s)]
*  I've been on as well and like these guys and their audiences are receptive to yeah to what I have to say [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6029.2s)]
*  And I think like optics play a role in that for sure like the way I carry myself the way I am [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6034.12s)]
*  naturally authentically I think is is a package that young men are are [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6039.76s)]
*  Not immediately dismissive of and I'm very aware of that and I try to use that for good [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6046.16s)]
*  And I try to use that to like explain to people that like it's not cool to you know shit on random people for no [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6050.76s)]
*  Reason they like let them live like yeah, fuck this to you. It's not gonna fix your life [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6056.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you're being a kind of a loser an entitled little loser, and it's not good [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6059.68s)]
*  And that does work. Maybe energy it works, and I think my the size of my community now and [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6064.76s)]
*  and the makeup of it is [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6070.64s)]
*  proof of that reality like I a couple years ago, I didn't have the numbers that I have now and [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6073.6s)]
*  Every single person [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6079.16s)]
*  Virtually every single person in my audience will tell you that like there is one key issue that I have [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6081.16s)]
*  dramatically changed their opinion on whether it be American foreign policy whether it be the way that they [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6086.28s)]
*  You know view trans people and we're transphobic, but now they're not or or even racist opinions, so [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6090.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's what I try to do to the best of my ability in my little corner of the internet [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6098.639999999999s)]
*  What's on piker good to see you yeah, thanks for having me when we come back congressman Seth Moulton [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6103.72s)]
*  Joining us now. He's represented Massachusetts six districts since 2015 welcome back to pod save America. It's congressman Seth Moulton [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6109.04s)]
*  It's not it's great to be here. Thanks so much for having me back alright, so if you look at the map [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6115.68s)]
*  It's a sea of arrows pointing red including in Massachusetts nearly every county in Massachusetts shifted [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6122.08s)]
*  Right both of the counties in your district did [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6129.0s)]
*  Everybody's everybody loves after we lose an election to know why we lost the election did you see signs before? [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6132.88s)]
*  That made you think this was [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6139.32s)]
*  That we were in trouble. Oh, yeah, this didn't surprise me at all [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6142.28s)]
*  I've I've actually thought for past a year year and a half that [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6146.36s)]
*  That we were likely to lose and and listen. I wasn't just sitting back. I was working hard on a winning strategy [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6151.08s)]
*  I've been campaigning all over the country and I have this this group of veterans called serve America [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6158.0s)]
*  Who've been running in some of the toughest house seats across the country? [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6163.64s)]
*  To try to flip seats that we need to win to win the house back and to hold the tough seats that we have we [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6167.36s)]
*  Had an 89 percent win rate [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6172.66s)]
*  As of there's still a couple elections that haven't been called so so I've actually been working on a really successful strategy [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6175.68s)]
*  But by and large it just felt like a lot of Americans [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6183.16s)]
*  Thought the Democratic Party was out of touch and when I I remember being in Pennsylvania just a week before election day [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6188.32s)]
*  And I did not have a good feeling [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6195.08s)]
*  How much of that do you explain by people were just really fucking pissed about inflation? [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6197.36s)]
*  didn't believe they were seeing the benefits of [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6204.56s)]
*  Joe Biden's policies had a really negative opinion about Joe Biden and as we've seen all around the world [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6207.4s)]
*  There is just an anti-incumbent anti-establishment fervor and [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6214.88s)]
*  The fact that Kamala Harris got so close to winning actually speaks to the fact that we mitigated [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6218.84s)]
*  What was a trend around the world? I mean look there's a definitely an argument there [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6224.76s)]
*  But I think too often Democrats use that as an excuse because look at the opposition here [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6229.56s)]
*  We are running against the first convicted felon to be president of the United States [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6234.8s)]
*  We're running against a party that's got a civil war playing out across the country between traditional Republicans and mega Republicans [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6241.12s)]
*  I mean they couldn't even elect a speaker the house for three weeks. That's never happened in American history either [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6247.8s)]
*  Never in American history have a president's senior advisors including military officials who usually don't get involved in politics come out and said this guy's [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6252.84s)]
*  unfit to be commander-in-chief [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6260.5199999999995s)]
*  So my argument would be I get there's anti-incumbency problems. I get there's inflation, but we were essentially running against [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6262.5199999999995s)]
*  Half an incumbent himself and this should have been easy [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6269.200000000001s)]
*  We should have been cleaning up from school board to president of the United States [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6273.72s)]
*  And so the fact that we lost it all is real cause for concern. Yeah, so in the wake of it [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6277.320000000001s)]
*  I like have these two competing [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6283.12s)]
*  Instincts one is to want to be open and just listen to all the different perspectives on what went wrong [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6285.6s)]
*  and but at the same time I end up feeling pretty suspicious when [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6292.64s)]
*  People say [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6297.52s)]
*  What they've always said right, you know [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6299.360000000001s)]
*  And I and I include in that Bernie Sanders puts out a statement after saying that Democrats have abandoned the working class [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6301.66s)]
*  I don't believe that's true. I'm sure there are ways in which it's true, but Joe Biden was an incredibly progressive [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6307.68s)]
*  President and did a lot of what Bernie Sanders had advocated for him to do [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6314.4400000000005s)]
*  So obviously the answer is gonna be more nuanced in that then I see [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6318.2s)]
*  Democrats like Alyssa Slotkin saying that its identity policy [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6322.08s)]
*  But we've been through news cycles about [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6326.8s)]
*  more center-left figures blaming identity politics then I see you talking about how [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6330.56s)]
*  You know Democrats need to have a debate about how we talk about [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6337.400000000001s)]
*  trans issues because Donald Trump ran this ad about trans issues and [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6343.24s)]
*  I [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6349.8s)]
*  saw I wonder like wait a second like [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6351.6s)]
*  Are people going to the explanations that they that they have had in the past for the parts of the Democratic coalition that they just [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6354.6s)]
*  find annoying and [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6363.08s)]
*  You know when when we lose an election, I blame the people that I don't like or that I have a disagreement with or that I [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6364.64s)]
*  in some ways [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6371.04s)]
*  Find irritable. I mean I think it's a really fair question and and we should always be suspicious [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6372.76s)]
*  I mean literally we should have these debates about these tough issues, right? [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6377.88s)]
*  But what I would say is [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6381.679999999999s)]
*  You know, look, you don't have to agree with Bernie Sanders, but you can't say that we have followed his economic plan [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6384.08s)]
*  I mean, I think there's actually a really legitimate argument for a more populist economic policy [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6389.5599999999995s)]
*  And I don't think we've adopted that [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6394.599999999999s)]
*  I think Alyssa Slotkin raises identity politics because a lot of Americans not just Democrats in tough seats [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6396.259999999999s)]
*  But a lot of Americans think that the Democratic Party is obsessed with identity politics [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6402.679999999999s)]
*  So I'm not sure we've put that issue to bed and I'll tell you a lot of you know [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6407.96s)]
*  Independence that I hear from including Marines that I serve with for example [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6412.64s)]
*  Overseas who really don't like a draft dodger to be commander-in-chief and don't really want to vote for Donald Trump [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6416.76s)]
*  But they say to me, you know, you guys are obsessed with identity politics or some other reason why we're just sort of out of touch [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6423.2s)]
*  That is something that I that I hear and I think also on contentious issues like look [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6430.56s)]
*  This 20-minute interview with the New York Times and talked about a lot of places where I think the Democrats are out of touch [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6436.5199999999995s)]
*  We're just not trusted on issues and they picked out this quote about trans women in sports [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6442.08s)]
*  But I do think it was a problem that Harris really just didn't even have a response to this vicious hateful ad [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6447.639999999999s)]
*  that honestly Republicans clearly [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6453.96s)]
*  Had data to say it was successful because they put 200 million dollars behind it or something [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6455.96s)]
*  And when you can't even respond to that then a it's back [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6460.04s)]
*  Politics because they can just clobber you over the head with it and and win [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6464.0199999999995s)]
*  On issues like that [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6468.42s)]
*  but also it does a real disservice to the communities that [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6469.74s)]
*  only the Democratic Party will be there to protect because if we just see the ground to [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6473.139999999999s)]
*  Republicans and let them get their hateful policies through because we don't even have a reasonable response [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6478.58s)]
*  then then they win and [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6484.139999999999s)]
*  That's dangerous for our party politically [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6487.099999999999s)]
*  But it's also dangerous for exactly the the folks like trans people and trans kids who genuinely need our support and protection [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6489.46s)]
*  You know everybody's come back to this so, you know the ACLU does this questionnaire then she's asked about it [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6496.86s)]
*  That answer becomes the basis for this ad and there's clear choice and not just on this issue [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6503.14s)]
*  But when she was asked about the policy changes she's had since 2020 [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6510.1s)]
*  Tried to make it about values to avoid kind of creating a news cycle of she has changed her position and [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6514.120000000001s)]
*  When she was asked about this issue in an interview [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6520.820000000001s)]
*  She said some version of that was just the Trump administration policy and it was a way to kind of get out of it [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6524.200000000001s)]
*  Now you can say that that should have gone a different way [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6529.64s)]
*  But more broadly, you know, the Biden administration puts out a policy [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6534.04s)]
*  to a compromise policy on [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6539.360000000001s)]
*  Trans athletes to try to [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6542.6s)]
*  Answer some of the concerns that people have and some of the attention that it gets while trying to stave off outright hateful [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6545.400000000001s)]
*  Republican bans right like demo like right that was an attempt to [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6553.200000000001s)]
*  Kind of do I think they Joe Biden did what I think you are asking [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6558.52s)]
*  Democrats to do to try to kind of enter this [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6562.6s)]
*  contentious issue [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6566.280000000001s)]
*  Try to have the debate and try to kind of signal some kind of [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6567.8s)]
*  Compromise the problem right is that like Democrats aren't obsessed with this issue [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6572.88s)]
*  Republicans have a strategy of elevating drawing attention to making salient [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6577.12s)]
*  This issue to try to make us talk about this issue Sarah McBride about to start in Congress [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6584.4800000000005s)]
*  She didn't come in and come saying I'd like to talk about where I'm gonna go to the bathroom, please [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6592.08s)]
*  That's Nancy Mace and Republicans are thrusting it upon us. And so how much of this is oh [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6597.92s)]
*  People how much of when people when you say oh voters think or people think independence think the Democrats are obsessed with these issues [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6605.12s)]
*  How much are you kind of blaming Democrats for living in a broken? [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6611.8s)]
*  media ecosystem [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6618.2s)]
*  Well, look, I mean it's you're right John [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6620.24s)]
*  There's no question that Republicans are the ones bringing up these issues badgering us over the head about it [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6622.68s)]
*  Right. I mean we've never had a problem with bathroom policy until Nancy Mace makes a huge issue of it [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6628.18s)]
*  And it's obviously an effort to just attack [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6632.52s)]
*  This one path-breaking woman who's coming to Congress [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6635.4800000000005s)]
*  But the problem is again that if we just don't even have a response then they're gonna keep doing this because it works for them and [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6640.96s)]
*  If we don't engage in this issue or refuse to debate it unless it's exactly on our term [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6647.200000000001s)]
*  Or have an absolutist position that the majority of Americans don't agree with [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6652.8s)]
*  Remember there are a lot of Democrats who just think the only answer to trans women in sports is not the Biden's [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6657.360000000001s)]
*  Administration's compromise policy, but it's just an absolutist view that no there's no restrictions whatsoever [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6663.360000000001s)]
*  Which of course, I mean the Olympics doesn't even agree with that, right? [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6668.4400000000005s)]
*  So it's totally reasonable to have this debate and yet the people I mean the fellow Democrats response to my even just raising the issue [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6671.0s)]
*  Was no, there's no there's no room for debate here. You can't even bring that up [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6679.08s)]
*  I mean the backlash really proved the broader point that I was trying to make but I also think that you know [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6682.64s)]
*  This was exactly what the Republicans were able to do with immigration [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6688.52s)]
*  I was I remember being on the House floor last year and there are some people colleagues running for this this position of [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6692.4400000000005s)]
*  Democratic messaging like chair committee chair and took supposedly in charge of Democratic messaging for the house [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6699.400000000001s)]
*  And I asked one of the candidates what she how she thought we should deal with immigration and her answer was we should not [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6705.28s)]
*  Talk about immigration. I said well, I actually think a lot of people are concerned about it because it does seem there's a real problem [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6711.76s)]
*  But the southern border just no we it's just dangerous [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6716.8s)]
*  It's dangerous to talk about it because it's used against immigrants and I just don't think that strategy has worked [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6719.2s)]
*  It's why even though we do have a reasonable bipartisan immigration policy in part represented by the bipartisan deal in the in the Senate [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6725.2s)]
*  Trump and the Republicans have just been able to clobber us over the head because there was a period where Democrats were just denying [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6733.759999999999s)]
*  It was even a problem. So totally legitimate concern like yes Republicans are the ones weaponizing [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6739.759999999999s)]
*  These issues but if we want to win the debate settle it and then focus on the things that we want to talk about [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6746.639999999999s)]
*  We have to do that. We can't just we can't just cede this to the Republicans. We have to win so on immigration now [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6753.04s)]
*  So that it sounds like what you're saying like sometimes I think what we're doing is saying like boy [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6760.0s)]
*  We made a bunch of mistakes in 2017 2018 2019 2020 that have we have rectified but have not [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6764.639999999999s)]
*  Successfully drawn attention to that in the public imagination [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6771.04s)]
*  Most there's some truth that most Democrats in the house embraced a pretty conservative [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6774.599999999999s)]
*  Bipartisan border deal Kamala Harris embraced that deal Joe Biden embraced that deal [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6779.16s)]
*  It's you know [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6784.44s)]
*  If the problem is a bunch of people running for president should have raised shouldn't have raised their hands about decriminalizing the border in 2020 [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6785.0s)]
*  Great, but I can't we can't go back in time and change what happened then [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6790.94s)]
*  But it seems like a lot of what you're saying has been addressed [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6794.56s)]
*  The problem is is it that people don't believe it because you just you're pointing to the other gonna be some Democrats that disagree [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6797.0s)]
*  What you're saying, but that's the debate we're having it [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6802.88s)]
*  Well, I don't I actually don't I think the backlash against me was not we should have this debate and here's my opposing view [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6807.0s)]
*  It was literally you can't talk about this [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6812.84s)]
*  I mean that's I just say you you did say it in a pretty dickish way [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6814.4800000000005s)]
*  Like you said it you said it but like and you said you said I don't want my daughters [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6818.4400000000005s)]
*  Overrun by a man on the football field like that sucks like that you didn't you didn't exactly invite the best version of the big yourself [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6823.28s)]
*  Look, but this is the problem John like you step back from this discussion, right? [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6830.76s)]
*  And just here to Democrats talking about the precise word choice and whether it was sensitive or not [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6835.400000000001s)]
*  Which I agree it wasn't the most perhaps the most sensitive words like this is exactly how a lot of Americans feel that [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6840.26s)]
*  The Democrats are out of touch and that we are obsessing on on these things rather than just having a reasonable discussion [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6845.860000000001s)]
*  I mean, yes, we're not always not everyone is gonna get the terminology exactly, right? [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6851.46s)]
*  Even you know fellow Democrats and I'll I'll take that criticism [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6855.320000000001s)]
*  But but we got to be able to take on the issues [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6859.22s)]
*  But look the broader point here, right the broader point is that you know [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6861.64s)]
*  I mean just to go to go back to immigration, right? [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6866.040000000001s)]
*  Because you're right. I think the broader point you're bringing up is in some places we have fixed our problems, right? [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6868.62s)]
*  We are talking about the border. We do have a reasonable immigration [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6875.0599999999995s)]
*  policy and so therefore the question is if we have a reasonable immigration policy and [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6879.3s)]
*  Trump's immigration policy is both unrealistic and just hateful [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6884.54s)]
*  I mean it's gonna tear apart families and communities across the country if he's able to deport millions of Americans not to mention it will [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6888.68s)]
*  Raise inflation which obviously people don't want then why is it that the American public trusts? [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6894.76s)]
*  Republicans more on immigration than Democrats [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6901.52s)]
*  Why is it then we have a great economic policy? [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6904.2s)]
*  Harris's plan would not only continue to bring down inflation but would actually reduce the deficit something that Republicans used to care about [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6908.16s)]
*  Trump's policy would triple the deficit and dramatically increase inflation because [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6914.4800000000005s)]
*  Deport deporting Americans raising tariffs and tax cuts for billionaires all contribute to inflation and yet [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6919.5s)]
*  The American public trusted Republicans more on the economy [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6925.86s)]
*  Yeah, and I think the my personal view and I look I don't know if I'm right. There's the view I'm proposing is [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6928.96s)]
*  That this is a place where people just feel like we might have the right policies, but there's a cultural mismatch [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6934.900000000001s)]
*  Like we're too preachy [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6941.82s)]
*  Rather than listening to Americans or we're standing in our ivory towers and we're not hearing the problems of [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6944.7s)]
*  Working people especially in rural communities [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6950.139999999999s)]
*  There's a sense that that people just don't trust us even if we do have the right policies [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6952.82s)]
*  And that's where I think we've really got to look ourselves in the mirror [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6957.98s)]
*  I mean look I'm saying I'm sitting here in Massachusetts with three Harvard degrees, right? [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6961.66s)]
*  Like I'm part of the three of them. That's it. That's a fan [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6966.299999999999s)]
*  But like it's but here's the issue, right? [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6970.98s)]
*  Look, I got I got into this whole business because of my time in the Marines and feeling that I you know saw the [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6973.9s)]
*  consequences of failed leadership [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6980.259999999999s)]
*  in Washington when I was serving four tours in Iraq and [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6982.259999999999s)]
*  I worked hard. I worked hard to get through school and to you know, get to Harvard [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6986.42s)]
*  I'm living proof that seas get degrees [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6991.099999999999s)]
*  So I didn't have a stellar academic career at that August institution, but when I showed up to my Marine platoon [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=6993.62s)]
*  My biggest liability was that Harvard degree [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7000.26s)]
*  Because these guys some of the best Americans I've ever met 18 19 20 year old [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7004.7s)]
*  Kids really from across the country who wanted to serve they looked at me and said [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7009.46s)]
*  He might be book smart, but he's probably not street smart and he's liable to get us killed [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7014.86s)]
*  And so when when I show up with this degree [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7020.74s)]
*  I've worked so hard from for much of my life to earn and it's literally my biggest liability [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7024.38s)]
*  what I quickly learned is I [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7029.18s)]
*  I've that's not gonna get their trust and in standing here and saying well [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7031.42s)]
*  Let me tell you how what I know because I went to Harvard and let me tell you how we're gonna do this is [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7035.58s)]
*  Not the way to earn the trust of those Marines and I think it's similar for us in in the Democratic Party [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7039.26s)]
*  Especially where we're concentrated in cities and urban areas. We're concentrated on the coast [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7046.02s)]
*  We just can't have this cultural arrogance of always telling people. Oh, we're right and you're wrong [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7050.54s)]
*  You're wrong but you're a bad person if you don't agree with us, that's what a lot of Americans hear from Democrats [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7055.7s)]
*  I had to tell say these these these fellow Marines. I [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7062.0599999999995s)]
*  Respect you. I hear you and that's [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7066.38s)]
*  How I'm gonna earn earn your trust not by frowning out trotting out my degree. Yeah. Well, I think that's I think that's smart [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7069.98s)]
*  I think nobody should from Harvard should ever trot out there to great but but I [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7077.98s)]
*  want to I think you're right about that and and by the way like I [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7081.62s)]
*  also think especially when it comes to issues that like [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7085.26s)]
*  Like I think we have backslid on [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7089.0199999999995s)]
*  LGBT issues specifically on trans issues, right and I think it's worth [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7092.66s)]
*  thinking about how that happens and I think part of it to your point is we need to like [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7096.42s)]
*  Not assume people have a lot of knowledge not assume people are approaching it with bad faith [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7101.26s)]
*  The reason I'm criticizing you and I'm talking to you about this in this way is because I'm holding you to a higher standard [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7105.32s)]
*  There are people that are new to this issue I [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7111.06s)]
*  Genuinely believe that the more people know trans people talk about this. I think that that's good for that's that's good for this debate [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7113.540000000001s)]
*  I think we will win this debate [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7121.18s)]
*  I think there's a difference though [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7123.540000000001s)]
*  Between how we talk about this with people we're trying to persuade and help understand that no like this bathroom issue like AOC's [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7125.780000000001s)]
*  What AOC said about it? I thought was like like perfect, right? [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7132.18s)]
*  Like hey like this is just a crazy thing that makes women and girls unsafe [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7136.0199999999995s)]
*  Right, like that was one way to talk about but like I think people want a member of Congress and a Democrat who's introducing [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7141.66s)]
*  a debate about a sensitive topic [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7148.0199999999995s)]
*  To be to be someone that they can trust to lead that conversation in a way that doesn't make them feel [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7150.94s)]
*  Like he's not on their side and I think that was the problem, right? [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7157.42s)]
*  Like I think you're right like we need to talk about like I think that there's completely an a conversation [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7160.599999999999s)]
*  That has to be had around sports specifically [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7165.54s)]
*  right-wing Republicans other people they're obsessed with the sports issue and like I like I want like I don't want sports like I just [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7169.46s)]
*  Want trans people to be safe and not to be afraid to go to the bathroom at the airport, right? [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7176.58s)]
*  like and just to be able to live their lives and if there's any way in which the issue around sports is a [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7180.22s)]
*  Distraction from that or that there's legitimate questions and nuance that needs to be addressed like we should have that [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7184.62s)]
*  conversation but to the larger point that you're making yes, like [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7190.46s)]
*  Democrats have this [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7193.54s)]
*  front of the classroom vibe, right? [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7196.139999999999s)]
*  That like we are [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7198.86s)]
*  Handraisers we are teacher you forgot to assign us homework [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7201.419999999999s)]
*  Types and we need more like back of the classroom energy [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7204.86s)]
*  One of your colleagues who talked to John also did a conversation with the New York Times at Marie glues and camp Perez [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7208.219999999999s)]
*  And she said we need to keep it local and that we shouldn't be represented by any more lawyers [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7214.0s)]
*  Where's your head on the lawyers? Should we are we done with lawyers? [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7218.86s)]
*  Yes, you know, I mean some of your best friends are [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7223.7s)]
*  My god who am I gonna offend by this comment [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7228.179999999999s)]
*  She's not afraid listen I gosh if you know me job, I mean, you know me a little bit better [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7231.62s)]
*  I'm always railing on the lawyer. Yeah, it's easy to go after a trans quarterback, but now lawyers suddenly you're skittish [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7236.74s)]
*  I think that I think that this is part of the problem with the Biden administration, you know [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7242.459999999999s)]
*  Look, I'm like a foreign policy guy. Everyone asked me like what do you think about the Biden administration's policy on Ukraine? [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7246.98s)]
*  And my answer is I think they've done everything right [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7251.54s)]
*  Three to six months late and why because rather than being an administration filled with decision-makers and executives and people who've run companies and whatnot [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7255.18s)]
*  leaders, right [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7265.54s)]
*  It's filled with a lot of lawyers who are just obsessing over every detail and having and hawing and I don't know [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7266.9s)]
*  Is this gonna cause this or that and what about the particular legal restrictions like just get them the guns? [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7272.0199999999995s)]
*  Just get them the [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7277.38s)]
*  Tanks fuck Harvard fuck lawyers. That's right. Well, at least we can all agree on that [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7279.82s)]
*  Yeah, but but but you know, look there are a lot of Americans who think we do have to if we want to be the [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7284.58s)]
*  Majority party if we want to win that to me this is all about winning [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7291.099999999999s)]
*  We can't advance any of our agenda any of these issues that we believe are so important if we don't start winning elections again [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7294.34s)]
*  And you just simply can't by definition win elections if you're not in touch [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7300.86s)]
*  You're not relatable to the majority of Americans [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7305.5s)]
*  And so we have to pay attention to what the majority of Americans are thinking you meet them where they are have a discussion on their [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7308.86s)]
*  Terms and then you know what we can try to bring them around to ours. I agree with that Democrats are preachy [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7314.74s)]
*  I feel like everybody's right [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7320.58s)]
*  Bernie Bernie has a point. I agree with do the Democrats are pretty annoying. I'm pretty annoying [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7322.46s)]
*  I'm pretty annoying Democrat myself. Look I could be pretty damn annoying myself, too [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7327.18s)]
*  But like look, can we talk like okay, what's the action plan here? Yeah, what are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7331.98s)]
*  What are we gonna do? The first thing is I think we need to like we can't just say we need to listen more [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7338.82s)]
*  We need to preach less like we need to actually very publicly [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7343.259999999999s)]
*  Go out and listen to Americans and and make that a very public thing where leaders of our party like Chuck Schumer [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7347.179999999999s)]
*  Sitting at you know cafe in in Ohio [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7353.5s)]
*  Like if he wants to be the leader of the Senate if he wants to be the face of Democrats in the Senate [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7356.7s)]
*  He needs to get down with farmers and sit on and you know [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7360.46s)]
*  Sit on a tractor and just not not to make a photo op [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7364.900000000001s)]
*  But actually to listen to what they're saying listen to what their concerns are [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7367.42s)]
*  So I think that that we need to actually practice [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7370.9800000000005s)]
*  That idea the second thing is you you brought it up actually these these interest groups, right? I mean another another [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7374.14s)]
*  Word for it is lobbyists and we always rail against Republicans for being beholden to the gun lobby and the oil lobby [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7380.740000000001s)]
*  Totally true they totally are they're afraid of these folks, but we're afraid of some of our own lobbyists [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7388.219999999999s)]
*  And and and we are beholden to these candidate surveys and we stress over them like we were just you know [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7393.099999999999s)]
*  Not do that like just you know [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7398.66s)]
*  Listen more to people outside of Washington rather than inside the Beltway folks who sometimes don't even represent their own interest groups [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7401.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, right [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7408.78s)]
*  They're more extreme than many of their constituents, right? [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7409.339999999999s)]
*  And then the third thing is we've got to elevate more leaders in our party [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7412.5s)]
*  Who know how to win in these in these tough districts like you look at some of the serve America guys like Pat Ryan [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7416.9400000000005s)]
*  Abigail Spanberger [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7423.860000000001s)]
*  Alyssa Slock in Jerry Golden who won the most Trump district in the entire country [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7426.46s)]
*  I mean these men and women who are true leaders in the Congress. They don't get to be chairs of committees [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7431.9400000000005s)]
*  They don't get to be leaders of Democrats and in leadership positions in the house because those all go to people in safe districts [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7438.98s)]
*  And everyone in a leadership position almost to a person is in a safe district [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7446.66s)]
*  And so we never hear from the perspectives of people who do have to talk to independents who do have to earn [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7451.74s)]
*  Every vote because they might lose an election and they only win by you know [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7457.86s)]
*  A sliver like like Slock in like Golden [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7463.34s)]
*  We need to elevate more of those leaders in the party [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7466.58s)]
*  And I think those are three concrete things more listening less preaching and actually show it, you know [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7469.5s)]
*  Actually elevate leaders who you know can can make you know can can actually tell us how we need to win [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7477.5s)]
*  Across across the country and and and you know do things and then pay less and pay more attention to them and [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7485.18s)]
*  the people [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7492.46s)]
*  Rather than the interest groups and lobbyists doesn't mean that they won't matter and that their views aren't important [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7493.66s)]
*  But we can't be beholden to them. What do you think about ranked choice voting? I love it. I [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7498.78s)]
*  Love it because I mean it's it's a tricky concept to understand [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7503.66s)]
*  I believe that if someone had just sat down with the founding fathers and explained ranked choice voting [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7507.9800000000005s)]
*  We would have it because it just ultimately results in candidates who are more representative of the majority of people [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7513.9800000000005s)]
*  And you're smarter than I am so you can probably do a better job of actually explaining why that's the case [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7520.82s)]
*  But that's the bottom line if you actually tend to get people who are more [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIv5oPIDmO8&t=7525.18s)]
