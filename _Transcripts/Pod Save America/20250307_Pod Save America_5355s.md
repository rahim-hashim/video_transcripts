Video Description: The DOGE wrecking ball keeps swinging, but the Supreme Court, and even Donald Trump himself, might finally be slowing Elon down. Trump backs off his trade war with Canada and Mexico—without extracting a single concession—as economic indicators begin their predictable slide. Jon and Dan break down the latest on government cuts, why Social Security is in danger, and the Democratic infighting over censuring Rep. Al Green for heckling Trump. Then, The Bulwark's Sarah Longwell joins Jon to discuss how voters are reacting to Trump's big speech—and why the economy remains their top concern.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Trump Retreats After DISASTER Trade War Fallout And ZERO Concessions From Canada, Mexico
**Pod Save America:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8)
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Jon Favreau. I'm Dan Pfeiffer. On today's show the Doge wrecking ball continues to swing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=0.0s)]
*  But it looks like the Supreme Court and maybe even Donald Trump might be clipping Elon's wings [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=7.18s)]
*  We'll get into all the latest there [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=12.24s)]
*  The government runs out of money next week [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=14.86s)]
*  But Congress is busy scolding one of its members for interrupting Trump's State of the Union [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=16.82s)]
*  Speaking of which I sat down with our pal Sarah Longwell from the bulwark the morning after the big speech [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=21.78s)]
*  To talk about how voters are processing the first month of Trump 2.0. So stick around for that conversation later [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=27.32s)]
*  But first we have some important updates to share on how the golden age of America is coming along [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=34.56s)]
*  Few days after launching an economic trade war against our fiercest adversaries in Canada and Mexico [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=43.04s)]
*  Trump is already backing down on Wednesday [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=50.68s)]
*  The White House announced that their new 25% tax on everything we buy that's made in Canada or Mexico would exempt cars [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=54.22s)]
*  Preventing what analysts say would be up to a $12,000 increase in car prices [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=63.34s)]
*  then on Thursday [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=68.82s)]
*  Right before we started recording obviously [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=70.9s)]
*  Trump said just kidding trade war is basically off until April 2nd on most goods from Canada and Mexico [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=73.74s)]
*  What changed you might ask well? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=81.14s)]
*  Canada didn't offer any concessions [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=84.62s)]
*  Mexico didn't offer any concessions [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=87.36s)]
*  But here in the United States the stock market tanked over the last week [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=89.98s)]
*  The Atlanta feds forecast model now predicts that the economy will shrink this quarter consumer sentiment is at an eight month low [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=94.14s)]
*  Retail sales dropped by the largest amount in two years and even though the Bureau of Labor Statistics jobs report won't be out until [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=101.58s)]
*  You're listening to this we learned on Thursday that employers cut more jobs in February [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=108.46000000000001s)]
*  Than at any time since the last two recessions I [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=114.22s)]
*  Don't know Dan. Do you think any of those economic developments might have factored into Trump's decision to? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=118.38s)]
*  Surrender to Canada and Mexico after just a couple days [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=124.46s)]
*  I do I do think it did because if there's one thing Trump cares about [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=128.06s)]
*  It's how rich people feel about him and here here are all the all this Wall Street buddies as new found [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=132.54s)]
*  tech friends all losing tens of millions of dollars in the market over a three-day period and [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=138.54s)]
*  So I think he reacted to that and frankly Trump probably also lost a lot of money himself [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=143.26s)]
*  I'm sure he has money in the market as well. It's not just in various meme coins [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=146.94s)]
*  I think he probably has some stocks and bonds too. And so yeah, I think that this is he reacts to it [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=150.45999999999998s)]
*  He is takes the Dow very seriously. He used it as a measure of economic success in his first term [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=155.89999999999998s)]
*  He did once tweet a long time ago that if the Dow [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=160.64s)]
*  Any president who has the Dow drop a thousand points over two days should be impeached? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=163.01999999999998s)]
*  Sure, he still stands by that opinion [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=168.29999999999998s)]
*  But so yeah [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=169.94s)]
*  I think this is he blinked because the market responded in a way that he did not anticipate which [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=170.73999999999998s)]
*  Suggests he really didn't prepare very well for this because it was pretty obvious what was gonna happen [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=175.54s)]
*  That's what I was gonna say. What did he think was gonna happen? Did he think everyone's gonna be like, oh great America's back [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=179.26s)]
*  He did say in the he was asked [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=186.01999999999998s)]
*  We're recording this on Thursday afternoon. He was asked in the oval about this and he said, you know [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=188.29999999999998s)]
*  Why do you think the stock market has been so spooked and he said well a lot of these are globalist companies [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=194.46s)]
*  Anyway, like we were trying to figure out what is that? What does that mean? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=199.06s)]
*  Companies with business abroad like I don't know the guy who owns a couple golf clubs in in Scotland [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=203.78s)]
*  I mean, it's the stock market [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=209.94s)]
*  it's also an issue that just [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=212.18s)]
*  aside from the stock market and aside from all his rich friends just breaks through I think in the media in a pretty big way because [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=215.22s)]
*  you have [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=222.38s)]
*  impacts of tariffs on like every different region of the country and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=223.98s)]
*  You know, we talked about this after the State of the Union [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=229.14000000000001s)]
*  I think I can't remember what we talked about when but you know [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=231.94s)]
*  There's like a clip on Fox News of some guy being like I can't get these cars off a lot now because they're gonna be [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=235.66s)]
*  So much more money. So I'm sort of also wonder if those stories started [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=240.66s)]
*  Getting to the White House and and made them a little scared [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=245.5s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not maybe I mean, this was terrible press for him [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=249.34s)]
*  There's every local paper local newscast was like how this is gonna affect prices for X, right? I saw a headline [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=252.5s)]
*  Here in the Bay Area about how the tariffs are gonna make Bay Area housing cost even more [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=258.98s)]
*  Mmm, and so you I'm sure you saw that across the board, but bad news doesn't really make it to this White House [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=263.38s)]
*  Yeah, right. So who knows but there's they are responding to the repercussions of this even if those repercussions were so obviously [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=269.18s)]
*  Forseeable to anyone who paid a lick of attention [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=277.18s)]
*  Alright, I got the toughest question of the day for you [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=279.82s)]
*  If you had to make the case that Trump's trade war is an actual cogent strategy [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=282.02s)]
*  How would you do it? I wouldn't I have self-respect [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=287.97999999999996s)]
*  It's not like it's not possible and if you want if you want me just for the as an intellectual exercise to try [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=293.98s)]
*  He the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=301.02s)]
*  Argument would be madman theory that he seems so crazy that people will [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=302.42s)]
*  Do what he wants because they can't pop because anything is on the table, right? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=308.06s)]
*  It's like keep it keep him on their toes. It's tough to implement that when what he wants is unknown [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=312.06s)]
*  Yeah, like this latest one. He like the first one [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=318.18s)]
*  There was a few fig leafs that like no one really believed [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=321.42s)]
*  It was like you got to help more with fentanyl and you got to do this and trafficking and immigration and all that kind of shit [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=323.88s)]
*  this time it was just like [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=328.98s)]
*  I'm starting to trade war with Canada Mexico and [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=331.22s)]
*  that's that and then he does a call with Claudia Shane bomb the president of Mexico and [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=334.06s)]
*  I guess the call goes well. I don't know how the car maybe she flattered him [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=339.22s)]
*  maybe she told him the speech was great on Tuesday night and [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=342.3s)]
*  Didn't even I guess he didn't even have a good call with with Trudeau with Governor Trudeau of our 50 first state and [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=347.02000000000004s)]
*  And that's it that was it there wasn't he didn't ask for anything he didn't get anything and then you just stopped so like [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=355.22s)]
*  When April 2nd comes around [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=360.34s)]
*  You know [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=363.66s)]
*  Do people take his threat seriously? Do they think it's really gonna last do they really care that much other foreign leaders? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=365.02s)]
*  I just can't tell yeah [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=371.48s)]
*  It's I mean the madman theory is that you were pretending to be a madman to keep your opponent on their toes [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=373.06s)]
*  Yeah, if you're an actual madman, it's it really doesn't work quite as well [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=379.7s)]
*  Because you don't you don't have any defined objectives. You don't have a strategy. You're just being an imbecile [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=384.5s)]
*  I also think that just backing off didn't necessarily work at least [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=388.9s)]
*  With regard to the stock market because it still closed down a couple hundred points again [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=393.4s)]
*  Probably because a lot of businesses are now thinking like how do we plan for the future? How do we set prices? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=398.42s)]
*  we don't know if there's gonna be more tariffs again or [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=403.86s)]
*  if he's gonna if he's really gonna go through with it with reciprocal tariffs on April 2nd like he said in the speech and [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=406.54s)]
*  You know unpause the trade war with Mexico and Canada if he's just gonna keep going and so it's just causing chaos [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=412.74s)]
*  It's chaos and corruption Dan like you always right can't see growth. That's exactly I mean for [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=419.46000000000004s)]
*  businesses [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=425.18s)]
*  They want a good economy. They don't want a bad economy [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=426.18s)]
*  What they really don't want is a chaotic uncertain economy because you can't make any decisions [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=428.88s)]
*  They really have to have some confidence even if the economy the economic outlook is not good [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=433.22s)]
*  They want to have confidence in that outlook 6 12 24 36 months in advance [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=437.1s)]
*  To make decisions about whether you're gonna open more stores hire more people build a factory launch a new product [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=442.1s)]
*  and if you can't have any sense of what's gonna happen because there was a guy in the White House who's just [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=447.18s)]
*  Capriciously making decisions left and right were for no foreseeable reason then they're gonna hoard cash [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=453.26000000000005s)]
*  To and what try to wait out the uncertainty in the chaos for a better time for investment and that's gonna be a self-fulfilling prophecy [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=458.98s)]
*  That's gonna hurt the economy because it's gonna mean less economic growth [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=465.58000000000004s)]
*  So fairly or unfairly presidents are usually blamed when a recession or inflation happens on their watch [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=467.82s)]
*  Even if they inherited the problem [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=475.06s)]
*  You know people sometimes give them a little grace period if they've inherited it [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=478.02s)]
*  But then eventually they get blamed if it if it persists, but it's not often you can draw such a [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=483.8s)]
*  Direct link between a president's actions and an economic downturn [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=489.82s)]
*  The [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=494.42s)]
*  Trump regime is already trying to avoid the blame for [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=496.42s)]
*  The economic uncertainty we're facing right now [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=499.70000000000005s)]
*  Elon Musk is saying that the US should stop including government spending in [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=502.3s)]
*  GDP calculations [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=507.74s)]
*  Some Republicans are claiming that we shouldn't count federal workers who lost their jobs in the jobs numbers [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=509.5s)]
*  What do you think? How big of a problem is this for Republicans? And do you think they'll be able to? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=515.26s)]
*  Lie their way out of this one. No, I don't think they're gonna lie their way out of this one, right? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=520.0600000000001s)]
*  It's like the one thing that people fully understand is the economy and for all that all of Trump's [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=524.18s)]
*  Messaging skills the size of his megaphone all of that. He cannot bend reality to his whims [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=531.06s)]
*  Maybe for his like most ardent fans [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=537.7399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but not for the middle of the electorate, right? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=539.9s)]
*  And you've already you're already seeing the softest Trump voters, right? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=542.8599999999999s)]
*  The new Trump voters the men under 40 who came to him [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=546.3s)]
*  There's a navigator [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=549.72s)]
*  Research uses a measure of people who voted for Trump but don't strongly approve of him [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=551.56s)]
*  All of those people are souring on the economy and they're souring on Trump because of what they're seeing and you're right [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=554.88s)]
*  this is directly attributable to him and [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=559.92s)]
*  It is a message that Democrats should latch on to because people are gonna see what's happening and we do have to tell a story [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=563.12s)]
*  about why it's happening and the fact that [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=568.52s)]
*  Trump is chaotic and erratic is a story that is quite believable to people because it fits with eyes ears [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=570.52s)]
*  Right, they know they know it and we this is I think you see this lesson in the 2020 election too [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=577.5600000000001s)]
*  Which is people will put up with a lot of Trump's chaos because they think there are positives to it in a [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=583.16s)]
*  sclerotic broken system [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=588.12s)]
*  But when that when that chaos starts impacting their lives [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=590.2s)]
*  Then they turn on him and it we are at the point where it is in affecting people's lives [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=593.4s)]
*  And I don't you know, there's obviously concern that they could [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=597.12s)]
*  Fuck with the statistics and the numbers around GDP and the jobs numbers the two that I just mentioned wouldn't be I mean [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=602.28s)]
*  You'd be able to see the GDP and then they were just subtracting government spending which by the way our old colleague Jason Furman [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=609.4s)]
*  from Obama world [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=616.3199999999999s)]
*  He said that if you stripped out the public sector production out of the Atlanta Fed's [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=618.8s)]
*  Forecast the GDP would be on pace for a [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=624.52s)]
*  3.8 percent contraction this quarter, which is more than there [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=627.92s)]
*  Than they were so I don't really know what [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=633.36s)]
*  Stripping out the government spending part is gonna do that Elon wants there [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=635.68s)]
*  I don't think it's gonna help that much and and you can say oh well [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=639.26s)]
*  The jobs numbers are actually this because we're not counting federal workers [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=642.64s)]
*  But everyone's also gonna know how many federal workers lost their jobs [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=645.8199999999999s)]
*  And even if you decide to go into the BLS like those decides to go into BLS and and the Commerce Department and fuck with [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=649.1999999999999s)]
*  The numbers this is like people are still gonna feel that [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=655.4s)]
*  The economy is not doing well, right? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=659.6800000000001s)]
*  Like that consumer sentiment like if you see high prices if your paycheck isn't going far enough [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=662.82s)]
*  It's not gonna matter what kind of headlines you see we just went through this for the last four fucking years [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=668.2s)]
*  Yeah, where we had strong growth low unemployment numbers and high prices and guess what happened people weren't happy about the economy, right? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=672.72s)]
*  There is a like Jason's right [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=678.04s)]
*  I mean the idea of taking government spending out of GDP as a way to make GDP look better is [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=680.16s)]
*  You have to be an idiot to think that like that's just not how it works. You're taking [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=685.52s)]
*  You're taking it just you're taking [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=689.72s)]
*  Things that drive growth out of a growth measure and think it's gonna give you more growth is foolish [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=691.8000000000001s)]
*  but the I think there is a downstream consequence to even talking about this which is [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=695.96s)]
*  If this speaks to the ends the business uncertainty and the economic uncertainty that's coming from this administration is these are the numbers that people make decisions on [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=700.32s)]
*  Mm-hmm, and if though we there are reasons to believe that people are fucking with those numbers [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=707.46s)]
*  It's gonna cause even more uncertainty [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=712.04s)]
*  Yeah, because it you know if that number comes in and it's better than people thought [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=714.04s)]
*  But they don't trust it because these people have been openly talking about playing with the numbers [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=718.24s)]
*  Then businesses are not gonna bank on that number as a reason to be more optimistic and therefore invest more. Yeah. All right, Dan [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=722.24s)]
*  So the doge days are not yet over [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=729.56s)]
*  But we're beginning to get some signs that Trump is finally realizing that he may be the doge who caught the car [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=733.16s)]
*  Oh [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=738.88s)]
*  Great great work [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=742.0s)]
*  Look, I'm really proud of that really proud [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=744.16s)]
*  In just the last week the CDC asked almost 200 employees back after letting them go [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=746.92s)]
*  Including people who work on the 9-eleven survivors health program [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=752.56s)]

*  NBC reported that doge is reversing course on axing several hundred veterans health care contracts after a quote [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=768.36s)]
*  revolt by frontline VA employees [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=775.5600000000001s)]
*  Although even more of the contracts remain on the chopping block some of which are already paid for on top of all that [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=778.08s)]
*  Doge also keeps losing in court a federal civil service board ordered the Department of Agriculture to temporarily rehire [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=785.52s)]
*  Over 5,000 employees a court told the Office of Personnel Management [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=792.9599999999999s)]
*  It could not directly fire probationary staff at other agencies [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=797.16s)]
*  And here's the biggie the Supreme Court narrowly rejected the Trump administration's attempt to withhold [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=801.48s)]
*  Billions of dollars in payments that the government owes USAID contractors for foreign aid [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=808.0799999999999s)]
*  Chief Justice John Roberts and Amy Coney Barrett sided with the court's liberals in the 5-4 decision [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=815.12s)]
*  Which left it to the lower court to quote clarify what obligations the government must fulfill [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=821.44s)]
*  Since the original deadline for payment has passed and what I can only assume is [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=826.64s)]
*  The response to all of this chaos and dipshittery [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=832.44s)]
*  Trump held a cabinet plus Elon meeting on Thursday where he appeared to put the doge back on the leash [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=836.4s)]
*  I'm sorry. Sorry [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=846.2s)]
*  It's gonna do something to amuse myself it's good it's great stuff Politico reports that the president said in the room that Elon is quote [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=848.8000000000001s)]
*  empowered to make recommendations to the department's but [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=857.0s)]
*  Not to issue unilateral decisions on staffing and policy those decisions will be up to the agencies themselves [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=860.5600000000001s)]
*  Following that report Trump wrote a long post on truth social saying that they'll now be using quote the scalpel rather than the hatchet [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=868.88s)]
*  And when he was asked by reporters about all this afterwards, here's how he described the new policy [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=877.0999999999999s)]
*  I want the cabinet members to keep good people. I don't want to see a big cut where a lot of good people are cut [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=883.8199999999999s)]
*  So I had a meeting and I said I want the cabinet members go first [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=891.3s)]
*  Keep all the people you want everybody that you need Elon and the group are gonna be watching them [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=896.18s)]
*  And if they can cut it's better [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=900.9399999999999s)]
*  And if they don't cut then Elon will do the cutting [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=903.58s)]
*  Okay, then I [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=908.9000000000001s)]
*  liked it I [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=911.46s)]
*  Liked that this whole thing is framed as like oh, yeah, like everything's great [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=912.94s)]
*  We're this is awesome. The cuts are going wonderful. Elon's doing great cabinet. Everyone loves each other that it's a golden age [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=916.5400000000001s)]
*  There's like a little small change [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=923.0600000000001s)]
*  We're making which is like we're not gonna fire all these people anymore and you can keep the people that you want and yeah [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=924.7800000000001s)]
*  By the way, maybe we fucked up a lot. But if you don't fire them, you know, I will fire them, right? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=929.62s)]
*  Yeah, cuz he's got to keep going back and forth. What do you make of all this? You think this is pressure? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=933.54s)]
*  You think this is what do you think this is? I want to know when the deep state got to Trump [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=937.86s)]
*  He you know what he's worried about he's worried about binder two of the Epstein files coming out he doesn't know what Pam Bondi [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=944.26s)]
*  Apparently, I don't know if we talked about this in the pod, but apparently there's a report that Pam Bondi [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=951.02s)]
*  She presented that binder at the White House with the Epstein files [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=955.5600000000001s)]
*  But that was all publicly available anyway as a quote-unquote surprise [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=959.0s)]
*  You always want your chief law enforcement officer to be the one [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=963.64s)]
*  Surprising you at the at the White House [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=968.08s)]
*  Those are always good surprises from the HE [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=972.2800000000001s)]
*  But yeah, no, so the deep state got to Trump I guess, huh? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=975.5600000000001s)]
*  I mean, let's see what really happens here. Mm-hmm. Like Elon is not someone who takes no for an answer [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=978.24s)]
*  he [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=984.96s)]
*  Let's just see what actually like what the if there is an actual change or this is just sort of window dressing [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=986.44s)]
*  I wonder if some of these closed-door meetings they've been having with [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=992.8000000000001s)]
*  Republicans [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=996.36s)]
*  Like some of the Republicans who are obviously too afraid to say anything publicly or at least most of them are [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=997.72s)]
*  Are privately sort of pressuring the White House and Elon [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1003.36s)]
*  I mean, I guess I guess Elon met with the senators and gave them all his cell phone number. That's that's fun for him [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1007.32s)]
*  I saw that Susan Collins has been texting him. Yeah, which is cool. Do you think there's any any emojis? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1012.96s)]
*  Who's using emojis first probably Elon, right? He's just he's all memes. He's an easy meme Lord. That's [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1017.64s)]
*  the [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1023.0s)]
*  I also think the cabinet has been blowing up Trump and Susie Wiles because just it's hard to [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1024.28s)]
*  Run an apartment when you have a bunch of unaccountable [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1030.52s)]
*  People running through it just cutting things and like seizing your payment systems and putting your building up for sale [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1034.88s)]
*  It's like they're trying to sell the headquarters of these departments like where the people gonna work [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1040.64s)]
*  It's okay. This is one thing I've been struck by [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1043.76s)]
*  Trump's order that everyone has to go back to the office and also we're gonna sell the office [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1046.6s)]
*  We're gonna talk about the Social Security administration, but there's like they're closing offices left and right and some people [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1050.92s)]
*  Some workers are like working in closets now and sitting on the floor because there's no space to work [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1056.24s)]
*  apparently they put [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1063.2s)]
*  one of the this was on Bloomberg TV they put a [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1064.6s)]
*  Building up for sale in Virginia and by doing so accidentally revealed a CIA black site [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1068.3600000000001s)]
*  So many questions about this [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1075.0800000000002s)]
*  So many questions. How did they know like how do we know they accidentally revealed a CNA? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1077.0s)]
*  I'm say what why is there a CIA black site in Virginia? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1081.68s)]
*  I mean that we're gonna have to I would say I texted that on our group chat with Ben and Tommy and no one respond [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1083.96s)]
*  Oh, we're going to be on that one. No, there were a couple people that made a great joke on Twitter about this [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1089.2s)]
*  Which is that they just assumed it was a DEI initiative [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1094.8400000000001s)]

*  So Elon's response to all this [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1103.96s)]
*  Seems as though he's blaming the agencies for the cuts [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1106.48s)]
*  They're making in a closed-door gathering of congressional Republicans Elon reportedly said that while he quote can't bat a thousand all the time [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1109.3600000000001s)]
*  It's the agency heads who are responsible for the job cuts and sometimes they're doing it wrong [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1117.04s)]
*  Okay [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1124.1200000000001s)]
*  Not so says Trump's hand-picked acting head of the Social Security [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1125.8799999999999s)]

*  that quote Doge people are learning and they will make mistakes and [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1156.4s)]
*  Quote I am receiving decisions that are made without my input. This is the this is the Trump guy [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1160.68s)]
*  This is the guy they got from middle management who's been there for years who decided to like, you know [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1167.48s)]
*  He's hand secret information. So like this is our this is our loyalist on the inside and he's like, I don't fucking know what's happening [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1172.04s)]
*  It's not doesn't seem great [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1177.48s)]
*  Other employees at the Social Security administration tell the post that some of the staff cuts spending cuts and office closures are already leading to [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1179.2s)]
*  Long delays in people getting their retirement and disability claims [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1187.0s)]

*  Thought Trump is gonna protect Social Security benefits and make government more efficient. What's going on? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1192.88s)]
*  Doesn't seem that way I would say that the I mean the you are just playing with absolute [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1198.52s)]
*  Absolute political fire to be in a situation where people may not get their Social Security benefits on time where they cannot their disability claims are not being [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1203.02s)]
*  Processed where they can't get anyone on the phone. Yep [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1210.8600000000001s)]
*  Like this is where the rubber hits the road, right? You see the same thing with the VA if you aren't getting veterans benefits [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1213.7s)]
*  Medicaid checks aren't coming out [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1219.06s)]
*  Hospitals are not getting paid for by for services rendered all like this is very real stuff [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1221.3s)]
*  And this is where I fix people's lives and this is like very the politics of it are devastating [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1227.38s)]
*  I mean again, it's supposed to be the Department of Government [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1233.06s)]
*  efficiency [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1236.66s)]
*  Right, like the whole idea is if this is a success then they save taxpayers money and they make government work better [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1237.8200000000002s)]
*  For less money, but they are so far just making it work [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1245.42s)]
*  poorly [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1251.1000000000001s)]
*  They are firing a bunch of people who they shouldn't be firing. They're already having to like hire them back [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1252.26s)]
*  They're [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1257.82s)]
*  people who are counting on benefits and services aren't getting them and [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1258.98s)]
*  This is why I think that Trump, you know [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1263.26s)]
*  The whole Elon and doge things sort of reining them in a little bit [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1265.78s)]
*  it does feel like if you just have a bunch of stories about how everything's broken and people are pissed and [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1269.22s)]
*  Things aren't working as they should I don't know what good headlines you get from that [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1275.22s)]
*  This is probably where there is some divide between Trump and the project 2025 architects including people like Elon Musk, which is [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1279.6200000000001s)]
*  Trump he didn't care about any of this shit [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1287.46s)]
*  Like he wants that he wants to root out people who are not on his side [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1289.82s)]
*  He wants to get a few quote unquote deep state at least until they got to him earlier this morning [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1293.3s)]
*  And and so like he's very on board with let's go through the FBI [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1297.78s)]
*  Let's get out of all the people who work for Jack Smith [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1301.5s)]
*  Yeah, let's go through the CIA and get all the people who leaked about me and my perfect phone call or about Putin or whatever else [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1303.58s)]
*  What the other people want to do is they just want to break government [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1312.58s)]
*  They just want to break it because they don't believe in it and just and it's gonna be really really really hard to fix [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1315.22s)]
*  Like you have to hire you're gonna hire more people are having to read like just imagine [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1322.46s)]
*  Saying about this last night [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1326.3s)]
*  Imagine you're the next Democratic president three years from now and you come in and you want to fix all the things of Trump broke [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1327.3s)]
*  How are you gonna get all of that done? How are you gonna hire a bunch of people? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1332.4s)]
*  How are you gonna reopen offices, right? It's just the it's not it will not be a turnkey usually [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1335.24s)]
*  When you switch administrations it is just there is a sort of a turnkey element of it you get rid of all the old executive [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1341.5s)]
*  Orders you put new people in you put new executive orders in and you can start turning the wheels of government start moving in your ideological [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1346.22s)]
*  Direction here that is not going to be available to the next president because the wheels of government being smashed by a bunch of people [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1351.78s)]
*  Who hate government? Yeah, it's also gonna be hard to recruit people to work in government after the way that [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1358.54s)]
*  Thousands and thousands of people have already been treated [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1364.18s)]
*  In this the reason one of the people go to government for many reasons one is public service many of them [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1366.5800000000002s)]
*  Particularly like the scientists the doctors they could work [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1372.66s)]
*  They could make a lot more money doing something else working elsewhere, but they choose this out of public service [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1375.46s)]
*  But also because a government job is an incredibly stable up until now [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1379.7s)]
*  They've been an incredibly stable job with very good benefits. Mm-hmm, right you had job security and [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1383.7s)]
*  Here now that does not exist anymore [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1390.38s)]
*  In a world where we're just like flipping back and forth between a Democrat and a Magna Republican every four years [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1392.4199999999998s)]
*  You're not gonna go back in a government for a long-term career because you know four years from now [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1397.1399999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump jr. Could be there JD Vance or whoever else and you could lose your job all over again. Yeah [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1401.82s)]
*  No, that's exactly what and I think that's their intention [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1405.96s)]
*  At least some of them [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1409.1799999999998s)]
*  How much do you think this has to do with the legal challenges that they've been facing because? [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1411.1s)]
*  You know if if it's if it's Elon [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1417.82s)]
*  And Doge doing all the damage then as we're seeing in some of these legal cases [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1421.82s)]
*  It's not it's not going well for them [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1428.82s)]
*  But if it's you know an agency head deciding hey, we're just gonna reduce the workforce of my agency [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1431.3s)]
*  That seems like it's a lot more [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1436.98s)]
*  It's a lot. It's a lot more legally viable. Yeah, that probably is part of it [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1439.3799999999999s)]
*  I know it's hard to imagine that Trump's giving public comments based on the advice of a lawyer to try to have a better legal [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1443.78s)]
*  Strategy that seems somewhat unlikely and out of character unless Suzy Wiles is really effective [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1448.78s)]
*  Like have you even heard Suzy Wiles his name since the election was over no, maybe that's how that she wants it [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1454.54s)]
*  I don't know. That's what they said about her in the campaign [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1459.74s)]
*  She's not really doing the same not really the same disciplined operation as the campaign. Yeah, that's that's true [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1462.1s)]
*  Like yes, technically it's hard that they're you're in a more legally precarious position if those just doing it [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1466.98s)]
*  That's not always true. These federal workers do have some protections. You do still need cause and reasons to do it [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1472.86s)]
*  so it's not [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1477.7s)]
*  maybe they would slightly improve their chances, but [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1479.3s)]
*  By switching it but I think it's I think this is more about the cabinet secretaries being like we just took these jobs [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1482.7s)]
*  We have no control throw these nuts running through a department doing everything and they complained to Trump and Trump [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1489.22s)]
*  They're the last person in Trump's year before this meeting. So he made these comments [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1493.7s)]
*  He may feel differently after you know talking to you lot on the phone tonight. Who knows? That's true [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1497.22s)]
*  We should also note in the Department of Bad Things that haven't happened yet [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1501.96s)]
*  But are probably about to the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump was planning to sign an executive order as soon as Thursday that would [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1505.22s)]
*  Abolish the Department of Education which prompted press secretary [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1511.14s)]
*  Caroline Levitt to post on X more fake news President Trump is not signing an executive executive order on the Department of Education today [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1515.74s)]
*  You know who knows? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1522.54s)]
*  This is a long-standing campaign promise. So it would not be unexpected if it happens [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1524.38s)]
*  Polar coaster listeners will remember that this idea is not exactly popular [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1530.06s)]
*  Honestly, even if you don't listen to the polar coaster, which you should [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1534.58s)]
*  You probably if you've you've paid attention to politics [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1537.94s)]
*  You probably would guess that eliminating the Department of Education is unpopular [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1540.98s)]
*  But would you like would you care to elaborate on how unpopular this is? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1544.3s)]
*  Yeah, it is one and when you test in several polls if you test Trump's ideas [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1547.5s)]
*  That are proposals or executive actions he's taken the most unpopular is [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1552.9s)]
*  Pardoning January 6 writers [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1557.42s)]
*  Right around that same neighborhood [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1559.5400000000002s)]
*  Abolishing the Department of Education. This is a Republican idea that that has been going back decades [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1562.1000000000001s)]
*  It is so unpopular that it sunk the Republican House majority in the 90s [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1565.5600000000002s)]
*  Mmm [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1570.5800000000002s)]
*  It was so unpopular in the 96 presidential election that by the time we got to the year 2000 Republicans were running on expanding the Department of Education [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1571.14s)]
*  That was the entire no child left behind [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1579.26s)]
*  George W. Bush it is a truly like those are the politics the politics are terrible [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1581.74s)]
*  It's an insane thing to lean into also not something you can do with executive order, right? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1586.42s)]
*  That's what I don't understand like what that is. It's just it's it's got to take an act of Congress [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1591.98s)]
*  You I mean what we thought that about a lot of things and lo and behold [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1597.6200000000001s)]
*  Well, it's the folks that USAID you may have something to say about it, right? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1600.74s)]
*  But so far, you know, of course I've been stepping in [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1603.78s)]
*  Yeah, so I don't know how that's gonna work in look. I think it's something like 90% of [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1606.7s)]
*  Education funding is state and local but you know [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1612.14s)]
*  The Department of Education does provide a lot of funding when it comes to student loans federal financial assistance for college [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1615.9s)]
*  also Title one which helps students with [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1623.9s)]
*  disabilities in [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1627.3000000000002s)]

*  Partly because what we have been saying which is like what do you what do you ask for and what can you expect? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1843.76s)]
*  To win from a shutdown. Yeah, the wind is coming out the sails on this very quickly and [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1849.96s)]
*  People democratic activists are gonna be super pissed about this [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1856.88s)]
*  And I and I understand that reaction for sure this is a as we talked about with Senator shift [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1859.92s)]
*  This is a singular point of leverage we have and to let it pass by seems [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1864.92s)]
*  You can understand why people will be mad about that now the question and I've been very torn about this question [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1871.4s)]
*  You and I have kind of gone back and forth over the course of the podcast on this [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1875.64s)]
*  I think we've each taken both sides of it. Yep, the question that you would have for people on the [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1878.48s)]
*  Pro shutdown side and ultimately we're not really shutting it down [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1884.5600000000002s)]
*  It is it's really gonna be can the Republicans get 218 votes? [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1888.1999999999998s)]
*  Yes to pass then then the ball be in the Senate score, but they have to do that first and [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1891.6799999999998s)]
*  I'm under the I imagine that no Democrat is gonna vote for that continued resolution in the house. I hope so [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1897.0s)]
*  And so they just make the Republicans get the number on their own and see if they can fall under their own weight [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1901.9199999999998s)]
*  but if you're on the if you were on the I [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1906.8s)]
*  Don't even want to say pro shutdown side, but if you're on the side who wants to fight here [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1910.36s)]
*  My question for you would be what was there what would be your public rationale for why you're opposing a clean [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1914.2s)]
*  year-long continuing of funding for the government at levels agreed to when President Biden was president and [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1920.6000000000001s)]
*  What do you think you could get out of that fight? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1925.96s)]
*  There would be something more than just there would be a substantive victory as opposed to just waving the white flag after some period [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1927.96s)]
*  Of time right and probably they would say well, okay [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1932.92s)]
*  Well, we're going to we're trying to shut down, you know, Elon Musk's sort of illegal destruction of government and then you say, okay [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1935.04s)]
*  Well, the White House is not going to agree to that [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1941.8999999999999s)]
*  Also, you know, I think maybe who knows maybe that's another reason as they're approaching the shutdown [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1945.6999999999998s)]
*  Why Trump tried to say that they're putting some guardrails around Doge and it's going to be agencies like you do need you need a clear [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1951.9799999999998s)]
*  goal [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1959.3799999999999s)]
*  And you need to believe that with enough pressure [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1960.9399999999998s)]
*  Republicans will agree to that goal and then you've got to think that a [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1965.06s)]
*  Government that is completely shut down will put pressure on Donald Trump and Republicans because they won't want that but [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1969.8600000000001s)]
*  Everything they've done over the last two months suggests that they very much like breaking government [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1977.9s)]
*  And so it's you know, and we you know when government is shut down like [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1984.0600000000002s)]
*  People are still getting their Social Security benefits and stuff like that [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1989.14s)]
*  So all the like most you know, it's it's look [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1991.74s)]
*  It's not a great thing when government shuts down and it's not usually politically very popular [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1993.8600000000001s)]
*  but [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1998.26s)]
*  right now all of the bad that is coming from [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=1999.74s)]
*  Trump and Elon destroying the government is like they're getting all the blame for it and Democrats are getting none of the blame [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2005.26s)]
*  And if we're shutting it down, then people say okay great. It's a fight. What are we fighting for? [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2010.6599999999999s)]
*  The test here is can Mike Johnson get a clean continued resolution out of the house [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2015.98s)]
*  Yeah [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2021.58s)]
*  And if not if you were to like if they were to add in what they call anomalies which are specific provisions [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2022.06s)]
*  specific cuts or policy changes within the CR that [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2028.72s)]
*  Implemented the Doge cuts the Democrats would have to fight that they could not they you cannot vote to implement the Doge cuts [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2032.58s)]
*  But absent that I think the question is much more challenging [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2040.62s)]
*  yeah, and it's just the one piece of advice I have for Democrats is decide what you're gonna do now and [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2043.3799999999999s)]
*  Do not raise expectations of something different right and yeah [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2047.5s)]
*  and if you do decide that you're gonna have the fight you gotta stick with the fight because if you do if you pull a [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2051.62s)]
*  Trump trade war thing and you shut the government because we've been there in 2018 [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2056.54s)]
*  And you shut the government that exact thing. Yeah, and you shut the government down for a week and then you're like, uh [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2061.18s)]
*  Okay, they're not doing anything. They don't care. Now. What do we do? All right, we're gonna open the government again [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2065.9s)]
*  It's just that's not that's the worst of all worlds [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2070.22s)]
*  It doesn't mean the Republicans are walking away from the Doge budget cuts though [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2073.34s)]
*  Mike Johnson says they'll figure out a way to codify those in fiscal year 2026 [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2076.94s)]
*  So not till fall. Meanwhile, though Congress has to move forward with the budget reconciliation process. This is the big beautiful bill [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2082.26s)]
*  Whatever you want to call it Trump's economic plan [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2090.1s)]
*  as a reminder the house has passed their budget resolution and the Senate will take it up later this month and [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2092.7s)]
*  While they can do all this without any Democratic support [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2099.38s)]
*  They need most Republicans almost all Republicans and so there will be pressure on vulnerable Republicans [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2104.18s)]
*  And it might be a bit higher now that the Congressional Budget Office has confirmed that the savings targets in the bill [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2110.62s)]
*  Will was we've all assumed this but now you've got it from the CBO [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2117.62s)]
*  nonpartisan scorekeeper of Congress [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2122.14s)]
*  That the targets that they have in the House bill will not be possible without cuts to Medicaid [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2124.54s)]
*  Medicare or the Children's Health Insurance Program [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2129.94s)]
*  How do you see all this playing out? Do you think? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2133.9s)]
*  You the Senate's just gonna look at what the house didn't be like. Yeah, that's too much. We're gonna go with our own thing [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2136.98s)]
*  You know the sense obviously not going along with the house does [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2142.66s)]
*  They're they have very different priorities. They feel differently about the Medicaid cuts [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2144.9s)]
*  They think a lot of the trillion dollars in cuts is ridiculous [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2148.06s)]
*  There's several centers have said that but that's a true impossibility and so like where how does this end? I guess is the question [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2151.46s)]
*  One way and I've been thinking about this because the budget resolution [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2159.18s)]
*  Itself is not a legally binding document. It's a pretty fake thing and you can amend it [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2162.5s)]
*  you can pass a superseding one that just all it is is a [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2166.54s)]
*  Is permission to pass something without a filibuster in the Senate? [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2171.58s)]
*  Like that's what it is and so it can say almost anything and they are not bound by this version of it [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2176.14s)]
*  The easiest things Republicans could do like the they have to pass something if they don't pass [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2184.1s)]
*  anything then the debt will the debt ceiling will expire and [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2189.86s)]
*  every nearly every American will get a tax increase at the end of the year and so the [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2193.3s)]
*  Though the position of greatest fallback or maybe of least resistance is just a short-term short [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2197.98s)]
*  Three or four year extension of the Trump tax cuts as is which is what happened to the Bush tax cuts in [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2203.6200000000003s)]
*  2010 I believe 2010 [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2211.34s)]
*  And so you could see that just you everyone lives to fight another day and [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2214.5400000000004s)]
*  The Republicans could probably do that [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2218.5400000000004s)]
*  Relatively easily if they if they with Trump's with Trump's help and they come up with some [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2221.1800000000003s)]
*  You know, they make it sound they make these cuts sound like a big deal [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2225.98s)]
*  But they're really not mathematically that you like include a bunch of Doge cuts and you include some like modest cuts here and there [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2229.04s)]
*  On spending but you don't touch anything big and you get your border your extra immigration border enforcement funding that they all are gonna want [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2235.64s)]
*  And then you call it a day that does some energy stuff. It's some energy stuff. Yeah, you drill baby drill that does seem like the most [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2244.8s)]
*  The path of least resistance for them. There's a lot of resistance on that path [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2251.6s)]
*  Well, I was gonna say provided that all the crazies in the house and some in the Senate like the craziest Republicans the [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2255.12s)]
*  hardliners [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2263.3599999999997s)]
*  agree to that because they want much much deeper cuts, which is the immigration is the [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2264.72s)]
*  Is the bait to get them to go along? Yes for the crazies because they care about cutting the government, but they care a lot about [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2270.56s)]
*  Some pretty nasty immigration policy. Yeah, and at some point you say this is the only this is the only train leaving the station [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2277.04s)]
*  Yeah, so yeah [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2282.64s)]
*  So let's talk about Democrats love talking about fun, right? [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2285.0s)]
*  so [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2289.92s)]
*  What they're doing so far this week is mostly voting against the Republican-led censure of [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2291.72s)]
*  Congressman Al Green for heckling Trump during the joint address [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2297.96s)]
*  Ten Democrats joined every Republican in passing the resolution which a censure is basically just a public scolding [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2302.8399999999997s)]
*  When a member is censured they then have to present themselves in the well of the house and [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2310.68s)]
*  which is the front of the chamber and [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2317.52s)]
*  While the resolution is read out loud and those words just sting when they hear them [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2319.7599999999998s)]
*  But Al Green [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2326.12s)]
*  When he was censured appeared with a gaggle of other Democrats who then saying we shall overcome [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2328.52s)]
*  While Mike Johnson banged the gavel and eventually sent the house into recess [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2334.08s)]
*  Dan which kind of Democrat are you are you the kind who votes to censure a member of your own caucus for? [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2338.6s)]
*  protesting cuts to Medicaid during the State of the Union or whatever the fuck it's called or [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2343.96s)]
*  Are you the kind who protests the kind who vote to censure the member? [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2349.64s)]
*  or [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2354.24s)]
*  Is there a third option? [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2355.52s)]
*  God I fucking hope there's a sure third option. It's all so stupid the whole thing is so dumb [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2359.04s)]
*  Every part of it every part of it like we can you know, we talked about this the pod we did right after the quote-unquote [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2366.7599999999998s)]
*  state of the Union [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2373.16s)]
*  and [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2375.4799999999996s)]
*  I say I find it very hard to care about what Al Green did. Mm-hmm. Like is it gonna win us an election? [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2377.4799999999996s)]
*  No, it's gonna lose this election. No, is it a big victory for Trump? No, it's anyone to remember this some years down the road [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2382.16s)]
*  No [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2388.2s)]
*  And so I don't really understand why ten Democrats felt the need to vote for this [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2390.2s)]
*  They're gonna somehow avoid getting anti Al Green ads in 14 months [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2394.52s)]
*  What do they think is gonna happen? Jim Hines from Connecticut? [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2398.92s)]
*  Was one of the members who voted? [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2402.56s)]
*  for the censure [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2405.08s)]
*  I saw a statement from him that he was like, you know ten years ago. No, not ten years ago much longer [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2407.08s)]
*  I don't know how many years ago when Joe Wilson [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2411.48s)]
*  Congress Republican Congressman Joe Wilson said yelled you lie to Barack Obama during [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2414.4s)]
*  not a State of the Union, but the [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2419.88s)]
*  Not a State of the Union [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2421.88s)]
*  But the no that was a state of the Union [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2423.8s)]
*  No, it was a joint it was a joint edge [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2425.8s)]
*  It was a that was not even a fake state of the Union. It was just a straight-up joint address [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2427.56s)]
*  This is 15 years ago. This is my stickler thing for everyone [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2430.96s)]
*  They always say to you know [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2433.52s)]
*  It was an address to a joint session of Congress about the health care bill about the Affordable Care Act and it was in the it [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2434.6800000000003s)]
*  Was in Labor Day 2009 [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2440.08s)]
*  Anyway, so times was like I voted for that and so I want to be consistent now that wasn't a censure [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2442.2000000000003s)]
*  That was a resolution of disapproval [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2448.08s)]
*  Which also like [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2450.24s)]
*  The world has changed Jim Hines the world has changed so I don't know I I think it's so I think the whole thing is so [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2453.12s)]
*  stupid and also it's like [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2459.3199999999997s)]
*  My view on this is like if you're Al Green and you feel strongly about this and you want to protest [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2461.4s)]
*  during the speech [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2467.68s)]
*  Then you know that that could come with censure. It's a Republican controlled house and [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2469.3199999999997s)]
*  As far as we can tell Al Green, he said, okay fine censure me [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2474.56s)]
*  I don't give a shit like I did it. I'm proud I did it and [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2478.56s)]
*  Was I trying to like win an election? No, was I trying to call attention to Medicaid cuts? [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2482.7599999999998s)]
*  Yes, did that is that what he did? I think from the coverage probably not right? [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2487.44s)]
*  Because that's not what the coverage was about if you're a casual observer of politics you'd be like, oh, yeah [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2493.7599999999998s)]
*  There was a disturbance at the beginning of the speech [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2498.44s)]
*  They kicked some guy out [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2500.4s)]
*  then everyone got mad that some Democrats weren't standing up and clapping for the the kid with cancer and [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2501.84s)]
*  Blah blah blah if it and and that's actually being generous because I think most people who are casual news observer [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2506.7599999999998s)]
*  Probably don't know any of this, right? [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2513.72s)]
*  So did it achieve it? No, but like, you know [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2515.3599999999997s)]
*  He wanted to do it and if you want to protest you protest [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2518.2799999999997s)]
*  My thing is if you want to protest and you want to commit, you know civil disobedience and this that's a stretch [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2521.24s)]
*  Just say this is civil disobedience because it's not bringing any law. It's just breaking the rules of the house [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2526.3599999999997s)]
*  Then you you know, then you accept the consequences of that and that's what civil disobedience is [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2531.3999999999996s)]
*  Then for Democrats to be like, oh, I got a vote to censure him. It's like, you know censure is for [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2536.4s)]
*  Like if you look through history, you know [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2541.76s)]
*  Like way back when I think they they've censured some people for like inappropriate language on the house floor in like the early 1900s [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2545.04s)]
*  Usually it's like you committed fraud you committed bribery [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2551.76s)]
*  I think Paul Gosar got censured for [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2555.48s)]
*  You know trying to incite violence against other members or something like that, you know [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2560.2000000000003s)]
*  Interrupting the president during the State of the Union. I don't know. It's also fucking it's what Kevin McCarthy wanted to do to Trump for January 6 [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2564.84s)]
*  As an example, this is why this and I'm glad you brought up January 6 [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2572.64s)]
*  Because this is when I get mad thinking about the whole thing because it was like the decorum [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2577.12s)]
*  Why did he do this and he stood up and this is why did Democrats do this? [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2582.2s)]
*  So that's like what are we all talking about? Do we all like we were all alive in [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2586.2s)]
*  January of 2021 when a bunch of fucking rioters went into the Capitol trying to kill a bunch of members of Congress [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2591.0s)]
*  Because the current president United States sent them there [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2598.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, the ringleader was speaking at the time [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2602.6000000000004s)]
*  that's who he interrupted the guy who incited the riot and people who had tried to give it like [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2605.4s)]
*  Just the only thing I'd say about this is [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2610.28s)]
*  No one is better at turning a five-minute moment to a five-day story than Democrats. I know I know we had everyone everyone's like [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2613.4s)]
*  Oh it happened. What is my reaction to it? [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2619.52s)]
*  Like I'm uncomfortable with it and that's an okay thing to be is to be uncomfortable with it [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2621.84s)]
*  but then their first reaction is to dial up someone from Politico and Axios and complain about it and [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2624.8s)]
*  then then we're gonna have the censor vote and so instead of making what I think would be a fair-minded political argument that [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2630.32s)]
*  The economy is teetering and prices are up the world's in chaos. And what is the house doing? [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2636.8s)]
*  They're spending their time censoring the guy with the cane. Like what are we doing? We just 10 of us had to vote for it [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2641.64s)]
*  So now now everyone's gonna be mad at the 10 people [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2646.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's like gonna be a whole nother set of stories [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2649.56s)]
*  Let's primary the 10 people and what the fuck are Democrats doing and let you know [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2651.4s)]
*  So I see some of you need to start a third party, but what's like everyone just calm like come on [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2655.08s)]
*  This is not the most effective use of our time or our energy. None of it [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2660.0s)]
*  None of it and I said there's any side of it and I and I would definitely not have been one of those 10 [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2666.52s)]
*  I think I think that's a dumb vote. But like again, I just think the whole thing is crazy [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2672.16s)]
*  Anyway our friends at blueprint [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2679.56s)]
*  Apropos of a great segue actually our friends of blueprint released a new poll on Thursday morning that found that regular Americans [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2682.64s)]
*  Aren't exactly wowed by Democrats performance in the new Trump term [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2689.04s)]
*  40% of respondents chose the statement the Democratic Party doesn't have any strategy at all for responding to Trump as opposed to only [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2694.3199999999997s)]
*  24% who think there is a strategy but it isn't working and a meager 10% who think there is a strategy that is working well [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2701.2s)]
*  Who the hell are those people? [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2709.2s)]
*  I [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2711.2s)]
*  Wanted I want to meet the 10% who think there's a strategy and that it's working well and I would like to know what the strategy is [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2714.2s)]
*  I think those people think Democrats are sleeper cells like Trump double agents [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2718.2s)]
*  The strategy if you think the stretch is held Trump you may think it's working any takeaways from the poll [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2722.2s)]
*  I don't think I needed a poll to tell me that people weren't happy with the Democratic Party [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2727.2s)]
*  Like that was not I did not need that that was I knew that [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2731.2s)]
*  Any any talk any conversation with any person who cares about politics will tell you that any moment on social media will tell you that [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2734.2s)]
*  There are some useful things in the poll beyond that they do [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2740.2s)]
*  They pull tests Trump's a lot of his actions and policies. They even more valuable [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2744.2s)]
*  They tested a bunch of messages that would be most effective in drawing contrasts with Trump [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2749.2s)]
*  There the content of those will not surprise you [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2754.2s)]
*  Number one protected Social Security Medicare Medicaid number two is about the economic chaos [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2757.2s)]
*  We just talked about number three is about veterans benefits and Medicaid [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2762.2s)]
*  It's like we know what those messages are but it's useful to reinforce [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2765.2s)]
*  That even with all the insanity and everything that's going on the most persuasive things are still the most persuasive things [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2769.2s)]
*  We thought they should we imagine that [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2774.2s)]
*  Yes [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2776.2s)]
*  So we can be constructive what should Democrats be doing any other not [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2778.2s)]
*  If they're not protesting Donald Trump in the speech or singing we shall overcome or voting to censure their own members [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2784.2s)]
*  Anything else I [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2793.2s)]
*  Think like I I just want to stipulate there are no easy answers here [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2795.2s)]
*  There is no silver bullet [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2799.2s)]
*  There is nothing that some Democrat or some group of Democrats can do that's going to stop Elon Musk right and expectations are completely out of whack [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2800.2s)]
*  And I understand people are scared and frustrated. They're looking to their party to offer a solution [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2807.2s)]
*  We just don't have the power Democrats don't have the power to actually stop them [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2812.2s)]
*  So you hear a lot of people saying like where's the message? [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2816.2s)]
*  You know, why don't we have a message and the message could be better. It could be better delivered [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2819.2s)]
*  It could be delivered more effectively whatever else [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2823.2s)]
*  But even if we had the most perfect message we're not solving the problem that most people want solved and we have to we do have to play at least some version of the long game here [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2826.2s)]
*  Which is we have one moment doesn't come for about a year and a half [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2833.2s)]
*  But when that moment comes we have a chance to actually make a huge difference in Trump's ability to destroy this country [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2837.2s)]
*  And that's to win back the house and maybe the Senate and the process between now and then is about [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2843.2s)]
*  Informing is about making Trump more unpopular and informing the country about what he is doing [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2848.2s)]
*  And I think the real dilemma here is and this is we can talk about this for hours and we are on a very tight 90 minute time frame [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2853.2s)]
*  People will find out very shortly is that we know what the most persuasive things to say are [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2859.2s)]
*  We just don't have the power to actually stop them. We just don't have the power to actually stop them [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2865.2s)]
*  And I think the real dilemma here is that we know what the most persuasive things to say are [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2871.2s)]
*  We just don't currently know how to make people hear those things [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2877.2s)]
*  And that there is a real gap between the things that persuade people and the things that generate the the engagement and drive the conversation sufficient people to hear it [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2881.2s)]
*  And the best advice that I have is we all have to be loud [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2888.2s)]
*  And so we can talk at all about what Democrats congressional Democrats can do. I'm more interested in what [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2893.2s)]
*  Everyone all of us can do what everyone listening can do which is go to town halls go to protests [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2897.2s)]
*  Call your member of Congress talk to all your family and friends use those messages [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2903.2s)]
*  I just talked about share the news talk about the cast point out the economics of like just be out there [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2907.2s)]
*  And because we we all have agency here and if we're just waiting around for Hakeem Jeffries or Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer or Chris Murphy or someone to save the day [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2913.2s)]
*  They can't do that for us. We're gonna have to do it ourselves [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2922.2s)]
*  It's not gonna happen overnight. But over the course of time between now November 2026 [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2925.2s)]
*  We can put ourselves in a position to win the House win the Senate and have really dramatically curtail Trump's ability to damage this country [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2929.2s)]
*  I agree with all that and one other idea that a lot of people have been floating and I think some Democratic members have said they want to do this [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2939.2s)]
*  But undercover story this week was the head of the NRCC job is to elect a Republican House reelect a Republican House in two years [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2947.2s)]
*  Basically told all of their members no more town halls no more town halls because you don't want people showing up at the town halls to protest you [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2958.2s)]
*  And so now all these House Republicans are not gonna have town halls probably next time they're all on recess [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2967.2s)]
*  And I think that Democratic politicians Democratic members and all of us like you just said should be going to those districts where House Republicans or Senate Republicans who are gonna be in competitive races in 2026 [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2971.2s)]
*  Aren't holding town halls and hold our own town halls or go to their offices and and hold protests outside their offices or hold town halls outside their offices or you know Democratic members [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=2987.2s)]
*  House members can go to the Republican House members districts that are maybe close to them in their states or the next states and say I'm gonna go and you know what and Republicans can show up to maybe Republican [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3000.2s)]
*  You know we can make it you publicize it and if Republican voters show up and want to argue with you that's great too like that's gonna get people's attention like you know like have some have some verbal exchanges with that with people who don't agree with you [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3012.2s)]
*  Maybe even the members themselves if you can find them again like I just think that like like you said getting people to hear it is gonna be the tough part you have to get people's attention and I do think there's a huge vulnerability now where there's gonna be some some bad news [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3025.2s)]
*  That's frustrating people from Trump and Elon but like in 2026 the people that we're gonna have to get people to vote against our Republican politicians and so far they're doing a great job just kind of hiding and now they want to hide more and they probably want Trump and Elon to take all the heat and it's our job over at least from now until 2026 to make sure that those people are famous [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3041.2s)]
*  Rokana and Tim Walz have said they're gonna go to districts. Yes those are the people I was thinking of. I knew it was two people. There's been a lot of reporting about what some of the people who are presumed to want to run for president like Gavin Newsom, Josh Shapiro, Gretchen Whitmer and Westmore others might be doing. This is a great use of their time to go do it. The one thing I would add in there is it doesn't have to be a competitive district. House elections rise and fall in the national political environment so if you don't happen to be there's [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3064.2s)]
*  near one of those California or New York districts that are competitive do it in a Republic any district. The walled garden of local news and politics doesn't exist anymore and so just if there is a thousand stories about angry town halls from all over the country that is going to affect the people in the vulnerable districts too. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3094.2s)]
*  Yes that is a point well taken. Okay when we come back from the break you're gonna hear my conversation with Sarah Longwell. Two quick things before we do that and you know what it's a Dan double header. New polar coasters out now. What did you and Caroline talk about this week? [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3114.2s)]
*  Well as I like to say Pots of America is for the nerds. Polar coasters for the super nerds. So we went deep into the question of why Donald Trump is becoming less popular. Why is approval ratings are down? Why people are souring on his economy? We also got into some bravo talk for people maybe into that but mostly. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3132.2s)]
*  I hear that made Elijah nervous the bravo talk. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3148.2s)]
*  He did he made Caroline record a topper to tell people that bravo talk was like a trigger warning for bravo talk. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3151.2s)]
*  Bravo talk is coming they are going to break their Dan and Caroline are going to talk about the page Craig breakup. Be prepared. That's good.

*  Dan I understand we've got a deal for message box too. God that is such a good transition. Thank you so much for bringing that up. I appreciate it. Yes we do have a deal for Pots of America listeners and really only Pots of America listeners for at least the first hundred days of the Trump administration if we make it that far. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3181.2s)]
*  So we are in this month on message box one of the things I'm very focused on is what I think what we just talked about which is the most important thing Democrats can do was make Donald Trump less popular. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3197.2s)]
*  So I have a series of posts that go into strategies tactics messages about what elected Democrats the DNC whatever else you do but mainly what all of us can do the right things we can say in our conversations with our friends and family about Donald Trump they could drive down his approval numbers. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3208.2s)]
*  And so if that is of interest to you I would refer you to the world's most cringe worthy website. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3222.2s)]

*  Sarah Longwell, welcome back to Pod Save America. Hey, thanks for having me. I feel I can't have we talked since the election. I listened to you every week. So this is what people do to me sometimes. I'm like I listen to every week. So I feel like we talked. I guess you talked to Pfeiffer right after the election. Yeah. And so did JVL. So it's hard to know because I also listened to you guys especially when we're doing crossovers. And so we just have we have a both a parasocial and a real social. That is that is true. What do you think of the speech last night? [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3339.2s)]
*  You know, I was annoyed by the speech for the positives in it because I think that Trump did a pretty effective job on several fronts. Number one was creating heartwarming moments with and this is I mean on right wing Twitter right now. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3366.2s)]
*  The big takeaway is that Democrats did not clap for the young boy with brain cancer and that they are ghouls. So I actually didn't catch that if they didn't because the cameras were just on the boys. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3388.2s)]
*  So I didn't see the crowd. Yeah. And I think that it is possible that what the reaction was was a frustration of you are sort of putting the camera on this young guy. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3401.2s)]
*  And it was a sweet moment. Right. His dream was to be a secret service. They made him a secret service thing. But I think that my guess is Democrats were sitting there being like this guy is cutting pediatric cancer research right now as we speak. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3413.2s)]
*  And like if I had to get in their brains, it would be things like that. But anyway, I thought I also thought the part where he went through the USAID stuff and like crack jokes about it and got out of it like that right now. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3426.2s)]
*  I've got Tommy on the show on Saturday and we're talking about foreign policy. And one of the things that I think Trump has done, especially on the right, is to create a constant sense of scarcity. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3440.2s)]
*  And when people have a sense of scarcity, they are constantly doing the math of, oh, money goes to Ukraine. It's not going to Americans. Money's going to this weird country I've never heard of. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3450.2s)]
*  When Trump does this thing where he's like pronouncing countries names as though, are these places even real? [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3461.2s)]
*  Lasotho? No one has ever heard of that. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3467.2s)]
*  Normally, the leader of the free world might not be keen to admit that they don't know where these different places are on the map, but Trump is happy to do it. And frankly, that lands, right? [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3470.2s)]
*  Because people also don't know where these are. And so while it was filled with lies and the smug faces of Mike Johnson and JD Vance behind him sort of fake laughing at everything he said, and it was too long and had all these problems, it did the job for the audience that Trump is trying to reach. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3479.2s)]
*  The fact, though, that he, this is the one thing, and I read Pfeiffer's message box this morning, and we did a live stream right afterwards. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3499.2s)]
*  And my initial takeaway was like the minutes that the economy got so deeply paled in comparison to what voters would tell you is their absolute priority, which is the cost of living and the inflation. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3508.2s)]
*  Trump barely talked about it except to blame Biden. Right. And then he spent the rest of like, if you, I should do this, I should go figure out what is the breakdown of things where Trump was talking about trans stuff versus the economy? [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3521.2s)]
*  Because I think trans stuff got way more time than our economic situation. And earlier in the speech, the first, I have the same thought, the first issue that he went into depth on was trans athletes. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3531.2s)]
*  Yeah. And it was like a lot. Yeah. And then he got to the economy and stuff like that, but it was very, Joe Biden did all the bad things to make inflation bad. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3542.2s)]
*  And then I'm going to do great stuff. I'm going to drill tax cut. But it really is. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3550.2s)]
*  The scarcity point is interesting because it's almost like I'm going to get government out of the way with all the bad things that government's doing, all the crazy, corrupt, woke shit. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3556.2s)]
*  And then once that happens, I don't need to do anything to the economy. It's just going to be great again. Yeah, you get rid of DEI and everything just, prices go down. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3564.2s)]
*  Those things exactly work together. Yeah. What? [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3574.2s)]
*  How do you think it landed with voters? You were talking about audience. Like we always know that even the CNN poll and the CBS poll, I think it was like 20% of the sample were Democrats in both. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3577.2s)]
*  This happens obviously when a Democratic president is up to mostly Democrats watch when a Republican, you know, so the audience that we're probably concerned about is the audience of, you know, maybe first time Trump voters. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3586.2s)]
*  I know you've been talking to them in your focus group podcast, Biden to Trump voters. What do you think? How do you think it landed? [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3599.2s)]
*  The speech landed with them? Well, so here's the thing. I just don't think that many people are going to watch like the State of the Union, which is not called the State of the Union. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3605.2s)]
*  Never this first one because he's only been there a little bit of time. I'm calling it State of the Union. Right. We're calling it fine. It's like Gulf of Mexico. Yeah, that's right. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3611.2s)]
*  These speeches are for two groups for people like us, right, who have to watch them and like hate watch them really. Yeah. And for fan service. And I thought it was a pretty effective fan service speech. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3619.2s)]
*  And the fact that it like blended kind of rally points and he was he was doing all the hits for the people. And that's why he talked about trans stuff. It's why he talked about spending. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3631.2s)]
*  It was, you know, and and and, you know, he did the thing with Zelensky where he read the letter there for the first time. Like it was pretty theatrical. Again, I don't think people are going to watch it or consume it last night. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3639.2s)]
*  But I think in terms of what they're going to get out of it, here's the main takeaway. Republicans were pumped. Yeah. During this, they look like they were having fun. The energy was high. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3653.2s)]
*  They looked like they were winning and Democrats sat there with their arms crossed, waved a cane and didn't really know what to do in the face of like North Korea levels of enthusiasm. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3664.2s)]
*  I mean, Republicans cheering at stuff that I'm like, well, if I showed you maniacs cheering like this, because Trump sounds for invading Greenland. Yeah. Right. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3677.2s)]
*  Like you guys would never have believed me. You tell me how deranged I was if I showed you what's happening right now. Ten years ago and said, no, you're going to cheer for all this stuff. And he's going to sound just this moronic. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3688.2s)]
*  And you're going to love it. They would have said, no, the only thing I liked about the whole speech and the only thing that I think unifies us today, because it's supposed to be a country unifying speech. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3698.2s)]
*  And the only unifying piece of it was, I think the ritual humiliation of Marco Rubio is something we can all get behind in that speech. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3707.2s)]
*  I think he's setting up Rubio to be the Patsy. Oh, well, she I mean, he was very he was almost explicit about it last night. But I haven't been this for a while. Like something's going to go wrong in the world. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3713.2s)]
*  And he'd be like, oh, that's Marco Rubio's fault. Yeah. Which is great. It's one thing that we can all be excited about. I like that. What did you think about the the Al Green interruption? [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3722.2s)]
*  The resist or the resist t-shirts, I guess there was the false thing. Here's my like I came down on the side of like, I don't really think it matters either way. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3734.2s)]
*  I wouldn't have advised people to do that. But then you have a lot of people online were like, why are the Democrats go at all? [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3744.2s)]
*  And it just feels it feels like there's there's a lot of debate about what Democrats should do among Democrats. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3750.2s)]
*  And then there's a lot of different responses from Democrats that we saw last night. And none of it seems like it's necessarily valuable. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3756.2s)]
*  I don't know that it's necessarily harmful either. I don't know. What do you think? [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3763.2s)]
*  I mean, I could go on at length about all the things I think Democrats need to do from a communication standpoint. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3767.2s)]
*  But I will say for a thing like this, I just think it's the thing where you sit there in stony silence and then clap for the kid with cancer. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3772.2s)]
*  Like, oh, yeah, that's basically it. Like, and I don't think I think creating Marjorie Taylor Green did this with Biden. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3781.2s)]
*  I just think when they have that scene from The Wedding Singer where he's drunk and he's yelling because I have a microphone and you don't like Trump's on stage. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3788.2s)]
*  He's got the room. You're not going to win this. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3796.2s)]
*  So just like sit there and be in. This is my overall feeling about Democrats right now is I think Democrats are internalizing the need that they need to be better communicators. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3799.2s)]
*  But for some reason, they are deciding that that means they should all just like get on TikTok and they should become vertical video is the way to be a better sunglasses and do a song. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3809.2s)]
*  Slow mo walk. And I just what I want to tell Democrat, if Democratic legislators are listening, you do not need to be influencers. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3818.2s)]
*  You do need to be influential, which means be governed and and give let the influencers package your stuff for audiences. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3827.2s)]
*  But you should look like serious legislators. You should look like people who are going to be an opposition party that people can take seriously. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3837.2s)]
*  And like if you're good at it, if you're AOC and you like know how to do it, cool. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3844.2s)]
*  But nobody should be going to Chuck Schumer and be like, you know what, Chuck? What we really need is you on the TikToks because that is going to give the Democratic Party the brand that it's looking for. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3849.2s)]
*  Like, don't do that. I know Dan Pfeiffer said that this is there's a lot of like reading stage directions from the Democrats, which has really stuck with me. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3858.2s)]
*  And there is a lot of that right now. And I'm trying to like give them some leeway because no one knows what we're doing right now. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3866.2s)]
*  And it's a new world. And like, did you read JBL's tryout this morning? [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3873.2s)]
*  This is such a mean question. What was JBL's day? [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3879.2s)]
*  He was he was talking about how we are not in that there's a group of people that think this is yeah, I haven't read it yet. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3883.2s)]
*  Well, you I'm sure you know, because he's your bestie. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3890.2s)]
*  But it's like that we're not normal politics anymore. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3893.2s)]
*  And then some people are like in a normal politics scenario, you sit down, you clap, the Democrats have the right message, stuff like that. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3896.2s)]
*  But we're not in that world anymore, which I agree. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3902.2s)]
*  Where then he didn't get to is like, so then what do we do? [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3905.2s)]
*  Like, what kind of response do you have in a not normal world? [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3908.2s)]
*  And that that I haven't figured out yet. I don't know if you have thoughts on that. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3912.2s)]
*  I mean, generally, I think I think part of the problem is that Democrats are looking for other people to tell them how to behave in this moment, because people do feel at sea. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3915.2s)]
*  And I guess I would say to them like, this is going to sound ridiculous, like, what do you feel authentically? [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3925.2s)]
*  Honestly, what I've been saying the same thing. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3931.2s)]
*  What do you feel authentically is is the thing that is the most harmful? [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3934.2s)]
*  And then go talk about that and do it as somebody who where you express your concern for the American people and the direction of the country sincerely and say, if I were in charge or what I think that what we should be doing instead is this. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3940.2s)]
*  And I just I do think everybody's like, well, what is my talking point of this? [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3955.2s)]
*  Like, by the time everybody gets their talking points or by the time everybody's being told what the everybody's focus as somebody who does focus groups. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3959.2s)]
*  I'm like, please don't wait for my guidance. Just say the thing you've you know that matters to you. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3965.2s)]
*  No, this is what I like. I have been outraged by some of the specifics around USAID. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3970.2s)]
*  It's like, I get it. I see the polls. I don't even have to see recent polls. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3976.2s)]
*  I know from years ago that like no one likes USAID. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3981.2s)]
*  Foreign aid is unpopular. But I also think like, you know, when the government already spends ten million dollars on like food for starving children and then they just like let the food spoil because Elon cancels the contract. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3985.2s)]
*  I kind of think people would think that's fucked up. I kind of think they would think that's wasteful. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=3996.2s)]
*  Or at least a measure of incompetence. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4000.2s)]
*  Right. Yeah. So it's like, know the political context. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4001.2s)]
*  But if it makes you mad, I think the passion is more important right now. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4004.2s)]
*  We're two years out from the election than figuring out exactly the right message, which we need to do eventually. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4008.2s)]
*  But like right now we need the passion. Yeah. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4014.2s)]
*  And also, I don't know. The message to me is always a little bit like, what are you mad about? [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4016.2s)]
*  That's Trump's fault. You know, like the reason I do focus here is a lot. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4020.2s)]
*  So I'm like, what is annoying them? What don't they like? [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4025.2s)]
*  Why is that Trump's fault? Like this is that's all the Trump guys did. Right. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4028.2s)]
*  Or are you mad about inflation? Are you mad about this? That's Biden's fault. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4032.2s)]
*  Biden's fault. Biden's fault. I'm going to fix it. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4035.2s)]
*  What did you think of? I saw that you said that Alyssa Slotkin's response was good. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4037.2s)]
*  What did you like about it? Well, you know, here's the thing, though. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4041.2s)]
*  Just what you and I were just talking about where we talk about the passion and the authenticity. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4044.2s)]
*  So I'm an Alyssa Slotkin fan girl. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4048.2s)]
*  I'm not good for this because I like I love a sturdy midwesterner who talks about the, you know, her mixed marriage parents of Republicans. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4051.2s)]
*  That's great. That is. And I also thought she was doing something really important. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4061.2s)]
*  I talked about this a little bit with Tommy that I think Democrats have been failing to do, which is you cannot. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4066.2s)]
*  Voters don't care about democracy, quad democracy. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4071.2s)]
*  And so to tell a better story about democracy, make people care about it, you have to tell a better story about America. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4074.2s)]
*  And she talked about democracy last night through the lens of America and why America is uniquely good. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4078.2s)]
*  And I was like, yes, this is what I have been waiting for. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4082.2s)]
*  The problem is that Alyssa is this is not a problem, that she's a serious person. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4085.2s)]
*  And so she delivered what I was like a 10 out of 10 technical speech for 2009. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4090.2s)]
*  And I just I think that if I think she can and should be a leader for the Democrats, somebody that they look to to think about how they're going to [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4097.2s)]
*  have like who their leaders are going to be in the future. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4107.2s)]
*  But I also think they're going to have it's such a it's such a tone shift to go from Trump's just casual way of being up there. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4110.2s)]
*  The bombacity to sort of the like very Washington. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4118.2s)]
*  I'm going to read a speech now. I'm going to do it very proficiently. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4122.2s)]
*  The substance is going to be very good. But did I make you did I light you up? [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4125.2s)]
*  Did I make you feel like I was your champion and I was no. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4130.2s)]
*  And like that's kind of what people I know that's what I listen to Democrats. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4133.2s)]
*  I listen to Democrats all day long. If you ask me what Democrats want, I'll be like, they want to win. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4136.2s)]
*  They want to feel like they are winning something and they want someone to go make them feel that way. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4141.2s)]
*  This is my almost exact thought. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4146.2s)]
*  And it's been like what has what I'm struggling with and thinking about what Democrats need to do, which is I would wager that if you had focus group [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4149.2s)]
*  dials of Alyssa's lock in speech, that if if you conducted a focus group and maybe you will, [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4158.2s)]
*  where you like play some clips of the speech, it would resonate really well with the swing voters, with people. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4162.2s)]
*  And I think it was like and I also think, you know, in fairness, it wasn't just like it hit all the message points. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4168.2s)]
*  I thought the end where she talked about democracy was it was stirring. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4174.2s)]
*  She was and she even, you know, she hinted that we're really going through something right now as a country. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4178.2s)]
*  So I get that people would like it, but then I also struggle with like why in our party are all of the [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4183.2s)]
*  the moderates who can win, who are on message, like they don't really they don't convey the urgency and the passion as much. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4191.2s)]
*  And then the progressives who are not necessarily on the message, they have the passion, but are not it's not necessarily landing with the right voters. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4201.2s)]
*  And I just I I want Democrats to combine both of those things. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4208.2s)]
*  And it's just really it's it's lacking right now. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4212.2s)]
*  We used to have this joke in conservative circles where like where we would talk about how conservatives didn't make good protesters, [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4216.2s)]
*  because it would be like, what do we want? Slow and gradual change. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4223.2s)]
*  When do we want it in the due course of time? [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4228.2s)]
*  And it's a little bit as the way that everything is upside down now, it's a little bit where Democrats are like that, [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4232.2s)]
*  where the sober and serious people in the party really who I think appeal to swing voters and can win in a lot of these swingier places, [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4237.2s)]
*  like they're not filled with the passionate bombastic intensity of what I think a lot of people are yearning for out of leaders in this moment. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4247.2s)]
*  They are they are threading a needle by saying, yeah, like what's happening right now is straight. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4257.2s)]
*  They're also like, but I'll work with him and I'll do and you know, they and that it's like Obama when he sat there chatting with Trump or Joe Biden went to the office. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4263.2s)]
*  There's there's this there's this real dissonance between the guy is a really bad guy destroying democracy and also hey, bud. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4272.2s)]
*  Right. Right. And it's not about because what people think when they see that or what I worry that people think is like, oh, it's all fake. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4281.2s)]
*  And what they're thinking when I'm sure Joe Biden was thinking is like, well, if we're going to be the party that says like, you know, we need to be a big diverse country politically and make sure that everyone gets along and institutions and laws and like I have to act like that. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4289.2s)]
*  But also we're in a media environment now where an attention strategy to get people's attention is the most important thing. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4303.2s)]
*  But to get people's attention, it feels like you need to be more like a Trump or more like some of the bomb throwers on the left. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4310.2s)]
*  And I don't know how you get people's attention in this environment being just a normal person who wants to like, you know, who has the right message and wants to be serious and sober like that. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4317.2s)]
*  That seems to me the challenge. Well, I think, you know, it's funny. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4329.2s)]
*  Normal person is better than normal politician. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4332.2s)]
*  And so I think here's here's the voters just say it all day long. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4336.2s)]
*  They're like, I don't so and so seems like a regular politician. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4340.2s)]
*  And I guess that's my unfair because I liked it. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4343.2s)]
*  Knock on the speech as it seemed like sort of a regular political speech. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4346.2s)]
*  What voters say that they want actually was talking to Dems right now is a real is funny because it's just a bunch of it is like it's black women and it's it's older white men. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4351.2s)]
*  Everybody everybody sort of agrees. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4363.2s)]
*  We need a straight white man who's not a politician. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4366.2s)]
*  It's like everyone is really internalized this idea that everybody is too racist because people will be like, you know, I love Pete Buttigieg, but we're never electing a gay guy. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4369.2s)]
*  Or I love, you know, Jasmine Crockett, but we're never electing a black. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4377.2s)]
*  Like everybody's just like, who is a white straight man who's also not part of like the Democratic firmament? [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4380.2s)]
*  And then, you know, everybody just goes Mark Cuban. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4386.2s)]
*  Like if you raise Mark Cuban to voters, they're all like, yeah, that guy or they bring it up. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4390.2s)]
*  And so and what they mean is, can we get our own bro ish billionaire who can go on every podcast and talk normally, but also basically shares our values. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4395.2s)]
*  Yep. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4406.2s)]
*  And bombastic, but not cruel. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4407.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4408.2s)]
*  That's right. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4410.2s)]
*  Which is like a TV show. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4411.2s)]
*  And apparently we're doing that now. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4412.2s)]
*  But it's now like you have this like very narrow, narrow spot where someone like it's really hard to find that person. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4414.2s)]
*  Well, and that is I mean, I just I kind of keep wanting to say to Democrats like don't I don't want you to believe that we're too racist and sexist country or too homophobic because I'm sorry. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4420.2s)]
*  But most like a lot of your best stars, a lot of your bench doesn't meet this criteria. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4431.2s)]
*  Also, we would never have elected Barack Obama if we were and that was again, people were saying that after 2000 after 2004 like, oh, well, Barack Hussein Obama. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4437.2s)]
*  No, we need like a white guy from the south. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4449.2s)]
*  That's the only way that we're going to we're going to win again. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4451.2s)]
*  So you've done a bunch of focus groups since Trump's inauguration. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4454.2s)]
*  What are people saying? [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4458.2s)]
*  It depends which people look. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4459.2s)]
*  So I actually maybe I'll try to split it into three buckets. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4462.2s)]
*  So the Trump fans write your MAGA voters. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4465.2s)]
*  The number one thing their takeaway and this last night he leaned into this, which is he's doing stuff and he's doing it fast. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4468.2s)]
*  He's like, yeah, it's like the action and they don't I don't really know what all these executive orders are about, but I know he's signing a lot of them. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4476.2s)]
*  And they're saying, you know, I see ice trucks in my neighborhood, so I know they're doing something about immigration. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4482.2s)]
*  And so there's there's really that bucket of love with and they love what Doge is doing. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4488.2s)]
*  What is it doing? [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4493.2s)]
*  They don't know. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4494.2s)]
*  But like it is doing stuff and they see the action. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4495.2s)]
*  And I think for what has become a real impatient American way of like, I do not want to wait for the Congress to pass all that. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4498.2s)]
*  Just do a thing that helps, which I think is not great for our system of government. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4507.2s)]
*  But there just is this sense of I'm not waiting for you to get get it together and compromise like Trump is doing stuff. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4512.2s)]
*  That's good. OK, so that's one bucket. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4518.2s)]
*  Then I would say there's I wrote a piece for the Atlantic yesterday, which JVL is like, why do you you literally have this other media company? [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4521.2s)]
*  Don't read JVL because I've been busy writing for the Atlantic. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4528.2s)]
*  I am the worst. I am the worst. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4532.2s)]
*  I deserve I deserve. But like the the they just hound me more than he does. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4535.2s)]
*  I don't know. They were they I was I had been doing a series of focus groups with kind of the low. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4539.2s)]
*  They're not just not hard partisans, but they voted for Trump. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4547.2s)]
*  I've done a lot of Biden to Trump voters. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4550.2s)]
*  And the thing that you hear from the sort of not super political, the not super mega voters is they're just like, I want something done about the economy. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4553.2s)]
*  Yeah. And and JVL and I do have this fight all the time about he's like the economy is good and this is all just fives and it's BS. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4561.2s)]
*  And and I get really mad at him because I say, I don't know, man. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4569.2s)]
*  All I do is listen to people talk about the real tradeoffs in their lives. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4573.2s)]
*  How much they know exactly how much everything at the grocery store is. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4576.2s)]
*  And it's not just like a talking point of groceries or gas, whatever people's cost of living is the place where politics meets their lives. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4579.2s)]
*  And it is an enormous impact. And they're not I don't think that they're brainwashed about this. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4587.2s)]
*  Right. Like they they go to the store and see there has been an affordability crisis even before inflation. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4593.2s)]
*  Like there's been an affordability crisis, especially around housing. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4599.2s)]
*  I mean, I remember even before the inflation really took off, I did a bunch of focus groups for the wilderness and like every demographic group that I talked to in every part of the country, young people, old people, housing, housing was their number one thing. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4601.2s)]
*  Yeah. And so like, I do think that's real. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4613.2s)]
*  I am certain that it's real. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4615.2s)]
*  And I think that it has been tough for Washington to like catch up to. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4618.2s)]
*  And honestly, I don't understand why this is so hard for even like JVL or Democrats to understand because we've been talking about people. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4622.2s)]
*  Democrats been talking about income inequality for forever. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4629.2s)]
*  So like maybe what's happening is that, yes, some people are doing well in this economy and that the macro economy can be well, while there's still a group of people who are falling further and further behind and sort of a middle-ish class tier that is finding the right way. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4632.2s)]
*  And I think that's the level of inflation to be really having a dramatic impact on their life. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4648.2s)]
*  So those voters are very interesting to me because I think those are the ones who easily either could swing back in 26 or even if they're low propensity and maybe aren't big midterm voters, they're the kinds of people that like they're just they're not like a firm part of the Trump Republican coalition. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4652.2s)]
*  They're just mad about prices. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4669.2s)]
*  And they're also and what they're saying right now is, why is he doing this other stuff and not focusing on prices? [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4671.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4676.2s)]
*  So I think that to me is a real opportunity for anybody who wants to disrupt sort of the broader Trump coalition is to say, hey, he's not focused enough on this. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4677.2s)]
*  And you can see it in the polling too. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4687.2s)]
*  It is it has been almost I don't know if axiomatic is the right word, but it has been a truism that sort of Trump equals good economy. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4689.2s)]
*  And that makes sense. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4697.2s)]
*  Trump businessman, good economy. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4698.2s)]
*  That's why he was elected. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4699.2s)]
*  And now he is his net positive rating on the kind of people like you're not paying enough attention to it. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4700.2s)]
*  And that's what we hear in the focus groups from this group. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4707.2s)]
*  And that's that's what I was listing is all the people who are like, I don't know, inflation is still really bad for me. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4709.2s)]
*  Maybe it's even getting worse. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4714.2s)]
*  So like the tariff stuff scares me or prices are getting worse. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4715.2s)]
*  And he seems to be doing all this other stuff. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4718.2s)]
*  He's not focused on this. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4720.2s)]
*  So I think that is an opportunity. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4721.2s)]
*  So that's the other bucket. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4723.2s)]
*  And then there's a third bucket, which is the Dems who are feeling very depressed and they are, I think, desperate for a leader like the absence of. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4724.2s)]
*  And I mean, I heard this before, too. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4740.2s)]
*  I think a lot of the frustration with Biden and his age that I heard from specifically from Democrats was just around the fact that he couldn't fight effectively because of that. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4743.2s)]
*  And like now they're they're just kind of like, where is everybody? [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4752.2s)]
*  Yeah. Where is the fighting? [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4755.2s)]
*  Where where are the people who are standing up? [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4756.2s)]
*  Why isn't this happening? [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4758.2s)]
*  And then, you know, it's you get it is tough because you sort of like beg the Democrats to do something and they're like, OK, well, we're going to go protest outside USAID. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4759.2s)]
*  And then you're like, no, no, no, but nobody meant that. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4768.2s)]
*  So it's a little it's hard. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4772.2s)]
*  It's not an easy solution. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4774.2s)]
*  But I just know what that's what they want. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4775.2s)]
*  How are they feeling about Doge and Elon? [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4777.2s)]
*  I know that when you did some groups, I think before the inauguration, there was some, you know, worry about Elon, but also let's give him a chance. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4780.2s)]
*  He's smart. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4787.2s)]
*  How do they feel now? [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4788.2s)]
*  And is the I'm very curious if the incompetence and chaos of what's happening is landing with people. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4790.2s)]
*  Yeah. So, you know, I did a good episode about Elon with Kara Swisher where we listened to we asked a bunch of Biden to Trump voters about Elon, what they thought. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4797.2s)]
*  And you could basically split the groups in two. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4809.2s)]
*  On one side, there are the groups. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4812.2s)]
*  There was the people in the groups who were like, yes, love this. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4815.2s)]
*  They're cutting stuff. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4818.2s)]
*  They're finding abuse. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4820.2s)]
*  They, you know, they know about the they think about the condoms like the fake condom story. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4821.2s)]
*  They'd internalize that, you know, and so they're and they also they know Elon. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4827.2s)]
*  I was listening to Kara talk about Elon is funny to me because I often listen to Kara only when she's talking about politics. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4833.2s)]
*  And when she was talking about Elon, I was like, oh, my gosh, you know, all this stuff that I had no idea about because Elon's just one of these cultural figures that I haven't paid attention to until he broke the political plane. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4841.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4852.2s)]
*  But a lot of these voters have been just like with Trump. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4854.2s)]
*  They've been tracking Elon forever. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4856.2s)]
*  They hold stock in his companies. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4858.2s)]
*  They think they want to go to Mars. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4860.2s)]
*  They're like they're invested in the whole Elon thing. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4862.2s)]
*  Then there's another half of the voters who are like, why does this billionaire want to be in our government? [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4865.2s)]
*  Like, what is he doing? [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4871.2s)]
*  And I often talk about how persuasion is not teaching is like making somebody switch a position that they previously held. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4873.2s)]
*  And so people have deeply embedded in them the archetype of the sort of evil billionaire trying to get more. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4881.2s)]
*  And so there's a lot of people who are just like confused about why Elon is doing this. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4891.2s)]
*  Why is Elon the guy? [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4895.2s)]
*  Why is this billionaire who gave they know gave Trump a lot of money? [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4896.2s)]
*  Like, what is the deal here? [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4900.2s)]
*  So there's this other group that's just deeply skeptical. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4901.2s)]
*  And I thought that was a real vulnerability for Trump and Elon. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4903.2s)]
*  And I will just say I know Kara gave you her theory about that. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4907.2s)]
*  He's just collecting all this data and information to feed into the A.I. models. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4911.2s)]
*  I think I think there's something there. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4915.2s)]
*  All the all the all the PSA hosts think I think I'm a little crazy, I think. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4917.2s)]
*  But I know I'm with you guys. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4921.2s)]
*  I think it's like a real it's funny. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4923.2s)]
*  Don't say that was her theory. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4925.2s)]
*  And it was just the first time I'd heard it. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4927.2s)]
*  And it made a great deal of sense to me as a thing, you know, because there's a world out there of people who know. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4929.2s)]
*  Elon really well, he's been and they'll they'll really balk at the notion that somehow it's all corrupt. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4936.2s)]
*  They're like, he's not corrupt. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4943.2s)]
*  He's just, you know, he's like a well, the whole I mean, this was the case with Trump to the whole like he's so rich. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4944.2s)]
*  Why does he need more money? [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4950.2s)]
*  He's already rich enough. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4951.2s)]
*  He's doing this out of the goodness of his heart that that has some purchase, I think that works with some voters. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4952.2s)]
*  Yeah, that he is doing this because he really cares about America. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4957.2s)]
*  And maybe I mean, I don't know. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4960.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4964.2s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know all the rich people. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4965.2s)]
*  And I don't know. But I just I suspect that people get very rich like that because they like to continue to get very rich. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4967.2s)]
*  Yep. I don't know about how much of it is like a deep corruption versus Elon thinking, having like a master of the universe feeling right. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4973.2s)]
*  Like, yeah, give me all this and I'm going to do what I want with it. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4985.2s)]
*  And like the ego on these people, that to me could be enough explanation itself. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4988.2s)]
*  But I do knowing not a ton about AI, just just enough to be dangerous. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4994.2s)]
*  It struck me as an interesting idea that the government was the last sort of big pot of information that one could get access to for the language learning models. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=4999.2s)]
*  And I do think and you would know this better, but I think for no small number of conservatives that the idea that Elon Musk has poking around in all of our private data and information and not like the MAGA fans. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5011.2s)]
*  But like some people have got to be like, and it was a slot can brought this up in her speech last night. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5027.2s)]
*  I know she has said previously that she was hearing this in some town halls in some rural parts of Michigan. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5032.2s)]
*  People were like, what is he doing in our data? Like, I do think that has some that that could be an effective message. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5037.2s)]
*  I think so, too. And I look, I don't I don't know what he's doing. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5043.2s)]
*  But that's also what's so weird is that all the people who love Elon are like big transparency advocates. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5046.2s)]
*  Elon himself will tell you he's a big transparency advocate. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5052.2s)]
*  None of this is transparent. And I do think that that is something people should be like, what is happening? [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5055.2s)]
*  You don't even have to say what you think it is. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5060.2s)]
*  Just put them on defense and say, I demand you tell us what you're doing with Americans information. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5063.2s)]
*  Last question, I'll let you go. How are you guys thinking about fighting back at the bulwark? [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5069.2s)]
*  Have you had conversations post election like, OK, this is a new world we're in. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5073.2s)]
*  This is pretty scary. And like, what's the best? What's the best way for us to contribute? [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5078.2s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I guess I don't necessarily I obviously have more activisty things that I do. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5083.2s)]
*  That is how I think about, like, how do you fight back? Exactly. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5088.2s)]
*  I think for the bulwark, it's more about. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5092.2s)]
*  I think that Trump is such a liar, that what he creates is this distortion field that for a big group of Americans suddenly causes them to be like, [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5097.2s)]
*  I'm trying to figure out what the truth is. Who can I trust? What is going on? [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5106.2s)]
*  And I want to be a place where people feel like I trust these people because we've earned it not by being right all the time, actually, [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5110.2s)]
*  but by having really honest discussions between us where we admit my favorite thing about like JVL and I do the secret pod. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5120.2s)]
*  And we call it the secret pod in part because we give ourselves permission to be wrong on it a lot. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5128.2s)]
*  And we but we tell everybody, I don't know that this is my opinion. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5133.2s)]
*  Like, I am trying to figure out what my opinion is. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5136.2s)]
*  And we we work through a lot of it together. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5138.2s)]
*  And so I think for us, we want to put more nutritious information to the world. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5140.2s)]
*  We want to have a community. We want we I think we do want to model, though. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5146.2s)]
*  And maybe this is more intentional than other than anything else. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5150.2s)]
*  There's a tremendous amount of fear right now. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5154.2s)]
*  And we are watching so many media companies be unwilling to say the true thing or kind of mind their P's and Q's or worry about their parent companies and the deals that they have to do. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5156.2s)]
*  And I think we just try to want to maintain and hold our space as we will continue to tell the truth. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5165.2s)]
*  And like we don't we don't care. We don't have Disney's not our parent company. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5170.2s)]
*  Right. Though if you want to buy us, go ahead. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5174.2s)]
*  No, no, no, just kidding. Just kidding. Bob Iger, if you're listening. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5176.2s)]
*  Yeah, we're not here to worry about, you know, their mergers and acquisitions. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5179.2s)]
*  We're just going to tell the truth in this moment when I think people are desperate for it and not a lot of people are giving it. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5183.2s)]
*  That's great. I think building trust. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5188.2s)]
*  I mean, the lack of trust is what got us here. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5190.2s)]
*  So I think building trust is really important. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5193.2s)]
*  Sarah, thanks for coming by Pod Save America. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5195.2s)]
*  As always, everyone check out the Focus Group podcast. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5197.2s)]
*  Tommy's on this weekend, I guess. Tommy's on this weekend. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5199.2s)]
*  Check out all of your podcasts. Go to the Bulwark. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5202.2s)]
*  Subscribe. It's fantastic. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5204.2s)]
*  We're practically doing crossovers. I know. I love it. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5206.2s)]
*  All right. Take care. Bye. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5208.2s)]
*  One last thing before we go. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5210.2s)]
*  Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Points USA. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5212.2s)]
*  General Magagoober. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5215.2s)]
*  He went on. He was the first guest on Gavin Newsom's new podcast this week, titled This is Gavin Newsom. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5218.2s)]
*  We have a new pod competitor, our own governor. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5227.2s)]
*  And so Newsom and Charlie Kirk got into it. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5231.2s)]
*  I haven't listened to the whole thing yet, though. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5235.2s)]
*  You know what? It's it's working. I'm kind of interested. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5237.2s)]
*  I'm intrigued. It's piqued my interest to see what to hear what Gavin Newsom and Charlie Kirk are going to talk about. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5240.2s)]
*  But anyway, what's most important for all of you is that Charlie Kirk offered this assessment of the podcast industry. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5245.2s)]
*  It's by no coincidence that out of the long form podcasting genres, the top 10, eight of them are conservative or center right. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5253.2s)]
*  Rogan, Megyn Kelly, Theo Vaughan, the Paul brothers, our program, Ben Shapiro, Matt Walsh. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5261.2s)]
*  There's a singular one on the left, which is Pod Save America, [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5268.2s)]
*  which is just like a bunch of Obama bros agreeing with each other for 90 minutes and saying that we're not very smart. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5271.2s)]
*  And, you know, and so anyway. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5277.2s)]
*  Now, I find that grossly unfair because we have kept this podcast just a hair under 90 minutes. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5279.2s)]
*  I'm actually worried now I'm looking at the clock that we didn't. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5289.2s)]
*  It's going to be close. I think my conversation with Sarah was 30. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5292.2s)]
*  We're like at 55 ad breaks. We probably didn't make it. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5296.2s)]
*  You know what? We're not counting ad breaks. We're not counting ad breaks. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5301.2s)]
*  OK, yeah. Charlie Kirk. Spot the lie. Spot the lie. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5303.2s)]
*  Yes, I appreciate the recognition. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5306.2s)]
*  Sometimes we disagree. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5308.2s)]
*  We just did over where you should hold town halls. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5310.2s)]
*  There you go. There you go. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5312.2s)]
*  All right. That's our show for today. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5314.2s)]
*  Tommy's going to be back on the feed on Sunday with an interview with Alistair Campbell, the top labor strategist in the UK about how parties come back from the dead. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5316.2s)]
*  His advice for Democrats and the mess in Europe. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5323.2s)]
*  It's going to be pretty interesting. So check it out. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5325.2s)]
*  And then we'll be back with another episode in your feed on Tuesday. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5327.2s)]
*  Have a great weekend. Talk to everyone soon. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5332.2s)]
*  Bye, everyone. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5334.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTWygOZXw_8&t=5353.2s)]
