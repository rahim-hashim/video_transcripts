Video Description: Trump v. Musk: Choose Your Daddy - SUBSCRIBE to our channel ðŸ‘‰@podsaveamerica 
Donald Trump and Elon Musk's romance comes to a fiery end as the two erupt into an explosive feud, attacking each other across social media. Jon and Dan comb through the insults, including Elon calling for Trump's impeachment, Trump threatening to end all of Elon's government contracts, and, our personal favorite, Elon tweeting that Donald Trump is in the Epstein files. Fun day! The guys also discuss Trump's recent slate of executive orders: another round of attacks on Harvard University, a 2025 version of Trump 1.0â€™s infamous Muslim ban, and an investigation into the alleged coverup of President Biden's mental and physical health. Then, Jon and Lovett sit down with Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson for an extended interview about their New York Times bestselling book,Â Original Sin, which reckons with Biden's decision to run for reelection.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around usâ€”one that doesnâ€™t just focus on whatâ€™s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when itâ€™s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save Americaâ€”a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because itâ€™s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. Thatâ€™s it. End of mission.

*  We got a big show for you today later in the episode [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  You will hear the interview love it and I did at an event with Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson earlier this week [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=10.56s)]
*  About their book original sin [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=16.44s)]
*  Might have heard of it [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=18.96s)]
*  But we have so much news to cover before that [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=20.56s)]
*  Trump signed a flurry of executive orders late Wednesday night one that bans or restricts the citizens of 19 [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=24.200000000000003s)]
*  countries from entering the United States one that bans all [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  International students from attending Harvard and one that orders an investigation into Joe Biden's former aides over potential actions to hide information [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=35.08s)]
*  Regarding the former president's mental and physical health [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  We'll get to those executive orders, but let's start with the news. They seem designed to distract from [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=45.8s)]
*  Donald Trump's third divorce [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=52.36s)]
*  This one from his campaign sugar daddy his doge bag in chief his dark MAGA brother from another mother [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=54.64s)]
*  Elon Musk [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=61.2s)]
*  Great job [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=64.64s)]
*  So yeah, you know in case it's a lot has happened Dan and we're recording this Thursday afternoon [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=65.28s)]
*  By the time you're all hearing this on Friday morning [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=71.68s)]
*  Who knows what else will have happened, but we'll just give you the quick rundown of how we got here [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=73.80000000000001s)]
*  It all started a few days ago when Elon called Trump's economic plan a quote massive outrageous [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=78.52s)]
*  pork-filled Congress spending bill that's a quote [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=85.44s)]
*  disgusting abomination [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=89.36s)]
*  He then threatened to quote fire all the politicians who support the bill in the 26 midterms [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=91.28s)]
*  Trump was [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=98.32s)]
*  Uncharacteristically quiet about this for about 48 hours [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=100.16s)]
*  Until a reporter asked him about it in the Oval Office Thursday morning [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=103.64s)]
*  And his response was worth the wait Elon and I had a great relationship [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=108.2s)]
*  But I'm very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=112.96s)]
*  Better than almost anybody sitting here [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=117.92s)]
*  And he only developed the problem when he found out that we're gonna have to cut the EV mandate [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  And he never had a problem until right after he left and he hasn't said bad about me personally [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=124.14s)]
*  but I'm sure that'll be next you saw a [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  man who was very happy when he stood behind the oval desk and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=132.2s)]
*  Even with the black eye I said you want a little makeup. We'll get you a little makeup, but he said no [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  I don't think so, which is interesting people leave [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=141.96s)]
*  my administration and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=145.84s)]
*  they love us and [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=148.52s)]
*  Then at some point they miss it so badly and some of them embrace it and some of them actually become hostile [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=150.52s)]
*  I don't know what it is. It's sort of Trump derangement syndrome. I guess they call it, but Elon endorsed me very strongly [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=157.8s)]
*  He actually went up in campaign for me. I think I would have won Susie would say I would have won, Pennsylvania easily anyway, so [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=163.72s)]
*  Trump Trump correctly predicted that personal attacks would follow as Elon has responded by [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=173.36s)]
*  Unleashing a flurry of tweets [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=181.36s)]
*  I think it's still going. I don't know we had to record at some point so who knows what's what's happening now, but so far [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=184.04s)]
*  The tweets have included quote without me Trump would have lost the election [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=191.07999999999998s)]
*  quote such ingratitude and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=196.12s)]
*  My personal favorite which he directed towards Republican politicians Trump has three and a half years left as president [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  But I will be around for 40 plus years in response [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=204.4s)]
*  Trump posted on truth social that he pushed Elon out of the White House because he was quote wearing thin and [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=209.12s)]
*  Then threatened to terminate all of Elon's government contracts and subsidies [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=215.23999999999998s)]
*  Not to be outdone Elon then said I [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=220.6s)]
*  Guess this is my new personal favorite. I was gonna say I clearly wrote that line before these tweets all right and then [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=224.88s)]
*  Elon said that the reason Trump hasn't released the Epstein files is because Trump is in the Epstein files [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=232.76s)]
*  And then Elon called for his impeachment and to be replaced with JD Vance [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=239.32s)]
*  whoo [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=245.23999999999998s)]
*  So Dan it was just four months ago. It was February [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  When Elon tweeted I love Donald Trump as much as a straight man can love another man now they've broken up [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=250.95999999999998s)]
*  right in the middle of pride and [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=258.91999999999996s)]
*  I [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=261.47999999999996s)]
*  Am just wondering if you have thoughts on the state of male friendship in America. It's a classic story [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=262.8s)]
*  To lonely love star people meet online [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=270.28s)]
*  They should [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=273.15999999999997s)]
*  They bond quickly over shared passions like taking food and medicine away from the world's poorest people [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=274.79999999999995s)]
*  They start spending every moment together to become inseparable almost feels like their personalities merge, but John they move [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=280.28s)]
*  Too fast too soon and before you know it [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=286.96s)]
*  It blows up. Maybe they moved in together too quickly [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=290.32s)]
*  blows up [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=293.32s)]
*  Things fall apart next thing you know one of them is calling the other one a pedophile and here we are a [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=295.23999999999995s)]
*  Pedophile that he says you wouldn't have been president without me pedophile [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=300.84s)]
*  I mean by by moving to impeachment [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=304.67999999999995s)]
*  Elon Musk has moved more aggressively than 99% of house Democrats on [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=307.96s)]
*  It is it's it's wonderful it is [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=316.0s)]
*  Elon finally after many years has found a way to make Twitter fun again [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=319.55999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, this was the best day on Twitter since he took it over [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=323.64s)]
*  I think it's the best day in politics since 2025 in 2025. That's what happened. Oh, I mean not easily [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=326.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there's not a lot of great ones so to choose from but [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=333.71999999999997s)]
*  Elon also let's say he he proposed a new political party [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=337.64s)]
*  He said why don't we have a new political party for the 80% of of people in the middle? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=342.21999999999997s)]
*  So I guess we're we're bringing back the Innovation Party [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=346.59999999999997s)]
*  That's a deep cut. That's a deep cut [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=351.35999999999996s)]
*  For those are for close readers of Axios in 2017, you know what that was you know who you are [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=353.68s)]
*  and [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=360.32s)]
*  He also hit Trump on tariffs. He quote tweeted someone saying oh, can we admit the tariffs are stupid now? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=361.36s)]
*  And Elon says yeah, there'll be a there'll be a recession [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=368.08000000000004s)]
*  They're gonna cause a recession by the second quarter by the second half of the year [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=370.16s)]
*  Elon is just going nuts. He is just tweeting up a storm [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=375.32s)]
*  This was always the risk for Trump with the Elon partnership and it's why Trump treads so carefully around Elon for so long [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=378.48s)]
*  because Elon has a megaphone almost as large as Trump's and he is very good at getting attention and [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=385.5s)]
*  When he goes he goes bananas and that's where we are [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=392.8s)]
*  He goes bananas. He certainly is today today's pod save America brought to you by ketamine [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=396.36s)]
*  That's just that's neither here nor there if anyone was wondering that's in reference to a New York Times story [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=402.2s)]
*  That's for the lawyers out there. I think we all know the New York Times story [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=406.59999999999997s)]
*  Which I want to get to at some point because I have a question for you before we get into the the current implications of all of this [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=410.92s)]
*  Let's go back to Elon [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=418.52s)]
*  Deciding to come out against the bill [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=421.32s)]
*  Why do you think he turned on the bill and he turned on the bill? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=423.64s)]
*  Why do you think he turned on the bill and ultimately Trump? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=428.88s)]
*  Was it because as the White House and Mike Johnson and other Republicans are suggesting are suggesting that the bill would eliminate [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=434.2s)]
*  tax credits for electric vehicles like Tesla's [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=442.71999999999997s)]
*  Was it out of a genuine concern for the deficit and debt like Elon says was it something else? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=447.08s)]
*  Trying to make sense of Elon Musk's brain [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=453.68s)]
*  It's quite a challenging challenging [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=457.32s)]
*  Mission you've given me I will say please use the code. Please use the code crooked for [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=459.72s)]
*  20% off your first order. What's the what's the website X.com? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=467.68s)]
*  What I do not believe it was because of the electric vehicle tax credits, yeah, he [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=474.36s)]
*  Trump ran against the electric vehicle tax credits the entire campaign [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=481.08s)]
*  He and you I know this because Elon Musk tweeted it out today, but they Elon Musk [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=484.96s)]
*  Was standing next to Donald Trump when Donald Trump was praising Elon Musk integrity by pointing out that [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=490.71999999999997s)]
*  He was supporting Trump despite the fact that Trump opposed the electrical vehicle the electric vehicle tax cuts and [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=496.11999999999995s)]
*  Elon had never asked him to change his position on it. So that I do not think that's the reason I think Republicans probably made a mistake [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=502.59999999999997s)]
*  By suggesting that right off the bat that probably inflamed Elon more to suggest that you could not I don't not saying his concerns about the deficit are [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=508.52s)]
*  Well-founded or necessarily legitimate. I don't know what his real concerns are here [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=517.52s)]
*  But I think they made a mistake like if I was advising the Republicans [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=522.12s)]
*  The Republicans made a mistake by trying to suggest that pure [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=527.0s)]
*  Picky you and greed was what was driving you on its opposition as opposed you could have just said we disagree here [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=531.72s)]
*  Yeah, and that's it and they did not do that and they made this situation much worse I think that [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=536.44s)]
*  You know an Elon has been tweeting videos of himself and retweeting other people tweeting videos of him [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=542.8000000000001s)]
*  talking about the the debt and the deficit and how what a problem was for a long time and I think that [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=548.4000000000001s)]
*  When Elon took over Doge, you know, he wanted to he thought he was gonna cut all the spending [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=556.24s)]
*  He thought he was gonna cut all the spending that he was gonna make government more efficient or whatever and [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=561.96s)]
*  He knows that Doge has been seen now is a basically a failure that the cuts were far less than what he said [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=567.76s)]
*  he could cut and [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=575.02s)]
*  so I think it kind of built from sort of feeling embarrassed or shamed about Doge to now being pissed about the bill and [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=576.6s)]
*  I also think it results from just Elon still to this day having served in government and [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=584.84s)]
*  Supposedly being a very smart person has no fucking idea [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=590.16s)]
*  What actually are the drivers of debt and deficit and he genuinely thought the fucking feeding USAID into the woodchipper and [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=592.88s)]
*  Which is you know has killed a bunch of kids in Africa that like somehow that's gonna bring down the deficit and debt and that [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=601.28s)]
*  The biggest driver of our debt. It doesn't he doesn't realize that the biggest driver in our debt is the defense budget [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=607.88s)]
*  Entitlements and the fact that at least in this bill Donald Trump and the Republicans want [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=614.64s)]
*  You know a couple trillion dollars in tax cuts mostly for extremely rich people like Elon Musk [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=620.48s)]
*  So I think there's like a basic lack of understanding about what causes the debt and deficit [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=625.68s)]
*  But then also he seems to care about the debt and deficit neither Trump nor Elon know what's in this bill or what it does [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=629.52s)]
*  Or how it works. No that they're like talking past each other. I [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=636.16s)]
*  Mean maybe he cares about the deficits, maybe he doesn't but if he were to truly care about them and truly understand how they work [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=639.88s)]
*  He would probably suggest giving back his tax cut right right or cutting the defense budget which funds most of his companies [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=646.6s)]
*  He's not doing that. He calls it like a pork filled bill. There's no pork in the bill [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=654.2s)]
*  There's a lot of dumb shit in the bill [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=658.72s)]
*  But this is not this is not the bit [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=660.2s)]
*  It's not because Republicans did not put pork in the bills because you cannot put those sorts of things in this type of budget [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=662.08s)]
*  Reconciliation bill this is not the appropriations bills that have like the bridge to nowhere to you know [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=667.36s)]
*  Another deep cut from a long time ago or this sort of the sort of classic pork barrel projects that are used as earmarks to buy [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=673.4s)]
*  Off members. That's not what's in this bill. That's not why this bus the deficit as of this deficit because it's a giant [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=679.6999999999999s)]
*  tax cut and a huge boost in the budgets for the Defense Department and Homeland Security to do mass deportation [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=684.28s)]
*  Elon is correct that the bill is a [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=691.76s)]
*  Disgusting abomination as he said the reason it's a disgusting abomination is because it [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=695.62s)]
*  Spends a trillion dollars to give tax cuts for people making over a million dollars [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=700.86s)]
*  So and then pays for that by kicking [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=704.62s)]
*  15 million people off their health insurance [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=708.5s)]
*  So that's that's why it's a disgusting abomination. So he was half right on that one [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=711.0600000000001s)]
*  The other I also think there was like a slow build in [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=716.22s)]
*  All of the stories that came out as Musk was leaving the White House after he left the White House about the cabinet being pissed [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=720.46s)]
*  At Musk and him not getting along with anyone in Trump world and I have to say I went back [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=727.0600000000001s)]
*  This is total conspiracy theory for me, but okay. This is where we aired them out, right? Just in public [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=733.54s)]
*  Yes, that's that's how it works [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=739.38s)]
*  We'll get to some of that later on but yes when you go to that when you reread the New York Times story about [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=741.46s)]
*  Elon's [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=747.46s)]
*  Alleged drug use while he was in the White House or while he was at least on the campaign [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=748.62s)]
*  traveling with with Trump [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=754.0600000000001s)]
*  early on it talks about how he's campaigning with Trump and the New York Times got a picture of his [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=755.7s)]
*  pill bottle that has like 20 random pills in it and Adderall and a bunch of other stuff and there's the Academy stuff and [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=761.58s)]
*  It's like source to people familiar, but the way that it's written [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=767.58s)]
*  I'm like who would have given that to the New York Times including a picture of [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=771.22s)]
*  The pill box that he travels with and I'm like, I don't know. He was with all the Trump people [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=776.94s)]
*  During the campaign. So maybe it was maybe he suspects at least who knows if it was or not [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=781.3000000000001s)]
*  Maybe he suspects that it was White House people who fucked him on that story. Can I try a different theory here? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=786.1800000000001s)]
*  Maybe that's right. I appreciate you delving getting out the red string for this [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=791.46s)]
*  Do you think JD Vance is the one who gives the New York Times? Oh interesting. Well, no, maybe not because he's trying to depose [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=796.58s)]
*  Trump for JD Vance. Yeah, so maybe Stephen Miller [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=801.58s)]
*  Maybe either way [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=804.66s)]
*  Awkward awkward dinner conversation Miller household now that Wow. Yeah for those who don't know [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=806.94s)]
*  When Elon left the White House? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=812.62s)]
*  Reports are that Katie Miller Stephen Miller's wife who was working for [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=815.14s)]
*  Elon or working as part of the Doge effort was gonna leave also [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=819.58s)]
*  to work for Elon [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=823.82s)]
*  post post White House owner she drafted some of these tweets and then and then someone noticed that Elon [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=826.58s)]
*  Unfollowed Stephen Miller after the after the fight broke out today. He also unfollowed Charlie Kirk [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=832.66s)]
*  This is a I know this is not really where you spend your valuable time, but this is a classic reality star move [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=837.78s)]
*  so that happens in sports a lot to where there's like an entire beat of people who are like [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=844.86s)]
*  The receiver just unfollowed the quarterback. What does that mean? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=849.14s)]
*  Here's here's my theory of what happened there. I think Elon Musk has convinced himself. He is some sort of [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=852.9s)]
*  fiscal [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=858.5s)]
*  austerity guy like he's he is come to it he's come to a self-identify is that we because of Doge and [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=859.62s)]
*  He probably thinks his bill is stupid because you know, he it is it is stupid [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=866.7s)]
*  So he calls it an abomination just a first he first he expresses some concern with it in an interview [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=872.1s)]
*  He gets some positive feedback for that then he calls an abomination. He gets a lot of engagement over that [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=878.22s)]
*  Now all of a sudden he has attention again because Elon really had stepped [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=883.7s)]
*  He had been the one of the main characters in world drama for about a year straight then he stepped back [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=887.14s)]
*  He was getting less attention. His tweets were getting less traction [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=893.7399999999999s)]
*  He was just kind of tweeting about like new Tesla features and start SpaceX launches and not in the set [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=896.26s)]
*  He wasn't the main character and now he this was a chance to be the main character [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=901.4599999999999s)]
*  Trump's talking about the Oval Office and he's in and he's like getting that dopamine rush [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=905.3399999999999s)]
*  Did you know so well a lot of people are talking about the ketamine but really the dopamine the dopamine [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=910.0999999999999s)]
*  People are just discounting all the dopamine that's coming from Elon just firing off these tweets and getting all the response and he's all [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=917.3s)]
*  Juiced up. Yeah to get to something that really matters as opposed to just the fun reality show drama [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=924.7199999999999s)]
*  How do you think this could impact whether? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=930.9799999999999s)]
*  Trump's bill actually passes Congress [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=934.14s)]
*  I think it makes the difficult task of getting this bill through the Senate and then back to the house even more difficult because [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=936.0999999999999s)]
*  Musk is giving voice to two groups of people who voted for in the house with deep reservations and [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=944.36s)]
*  And some senators who in these two groups who have reservations about voting for it now [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=951.2800000000001s)]
*  Those groups are the far-right [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=955.84s)]
*  Drown the government in the bathtub [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=958.12s)]
*  MAGA Freedom Caucus types who thinks that it didn't go far enough in terms of cuts to [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=959.72s)]
*  Medicare's that Medicaid snap etc. Then you have these sort of more traditional [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=966.6s)]
*  Republicans who are kind of like Paul Ryan Republicans in the closet [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=972.32s)]
*  Who have concerns substantively and politically about voting for a bill that adds two and a half billion dollars the debt at a time of hot [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=976.96s)]
*  Sorry two and a half trillion dollars the debt at a time of high interest rates where it becomes incredibly and prohibitively expensive to pay down [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=984.32s)]
*  That debt and and so those there's a group with this a lot of people are in the Senate [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=989.64s)]
*  And so he just is giving them cover to oppose this bill in some way shape or form [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=993.84s)]
*  Does it mean it won't pass? I don't know. I don't know that yet [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=998.6800000000001s)]
*  But it gets a lot harder than it was before this. This is the first real [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1001.76s)]
*  Obstacle that's been put in the way other than just caucus dynamics, right? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1005.8s)]
*  This is someone who is driving sort of driving shining a spotlight on the rift within the party and forcing it further apart [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1009.68s)]
*  and [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1017.72s)]
*  how do you think the breakup could impact the future of the MAGA coalition because [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1019.4s)]
*  There's a lot of a lot of people trying to figure out whose side they're on today [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1026.52s)]
*  In fact, I we have the five on in our office like we always do [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1030.52s)]
*  you know, we love to watch the five on Fox and see what they're doing and [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1035.0s)]
*  Here's how Jesse waters tried to navigate this today [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1039.84s)]
*  Sometimes guys fight guys sometimes will punch you in the face and the next night you're having a beer [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1043.24s)]
*  Sleep with your girlfriend and you patch things up [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1048.92s)]
*  Really [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1051.68s)]
*  Lot to unpack there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, let's go on Jesse. See that I'm not gonna touch that one [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1059.92s)]
*  I don't really want to know how that all played itself out. I [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1065.56s)]
*  Think is Jesse saying that you could punch him in the face and then he'll have a beer with you the next night [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1069.16s)]
*  So you think that's what he's saying? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1073.08s)]
*  I think he said I think in the end is he suggesting he's the one who slept with someone's girlfriend and then they [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1074.36s)]
*  The next day yeah, and then Greg Greg Gutfeld was kind of quiet after that, but anyway, anyway, let's we're we are too deep into the five [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1079.1200000000001s)]
*  right now, I think that where this has creates tension in the Republican Party is in the [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1085.4s)]
*  always [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1092.24s)]
*  uncomfortable marriage between the MAGA right and [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1093.76s)]
*  The tech right right the Peter Thiel David Sacks all-in guys [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1097.16s)]
*  VC bros who came to support Trump in this election for a whole host of reasons [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1102.92s)]
*  Some cultural a lot economic and they bought a lot of Trump's bullshit about [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1107.6000000000001s)]
*  There's what Trump went on the all-in podcast and he promised that we were gonna do these things to keep the high skilled workers [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1113.88s)]
*  Here of the country and he's gonna staple a visa to diplomas [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1118.16s)]
*  Yeah, and that's not what this is right and this tension has been [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1121.48s)]
*  Manifest in the Elon Musk Steve Bannon feud since the day after the election Steve Bannon you say yeah [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1125.28s)]
*  It was the same thing. It's gonna say today [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1131.48s)]
*  Well, yeah, so as this fight was escalating very quickly over the course of Thursday [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1133.24s)]
*  And Trump said I'm gonna terminate the contracts and then we get the Epstein accusation then we get the call for Trump's impeachment [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1140.2s)]
*  The joke was okay. The only thing left here that hasn't happened yet is Trump trying to deport Elon Musk and [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1148.44s)]
*  Sure enough Steve Bannon on his show calls for [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1157.3600000000001s)]
*  Elon Musk's deportation an investigation into [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1161.5s)]
*  Elon Musk's how he became a citizen of the United States what his immigration process was [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1165.74s)]
*  Suggest deporting him and then calls for Donald Trump to nationalize [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1172.4199999999998s)]
*  Starlink and SpaceX so he just he went Steve Bannon fucking that's it [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1177.62s)]
*  He went there in the course of three hours. We went from a mild [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1182.6999999999998s)]
*  Dispute around the financial implications of a budget bill to accusations of pedophilia deportation in peach in impeachment [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1187.74s)]
*  To your point about the tech, right? [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1195.94s)]
*  Derek Thompson tweeted the tech right got suckered by the most obvious con man in political history [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1197.94s)]
*  Defended him while he raised tariffs slash science and scared away foreign talent and now the administration is gonna wreck SpaceX for spite [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1203.6200000000001s)]
*  Well, Bannon calls for Musk's deportation. Well done. I think they're nailed it. That's it job people [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1210.42s)]
*  That is what that is exactly what happened with the tech, right? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1216.98s)]
*  They just they're total total con men and I don't think Donald Trump got like conned by them [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1219.54s)]
*  Because he just he got what he wanted. Although I will say [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1225.02s)]
*  So Trump had an event at the White House after Elon called for his impeachment and said that he was in the Epstein files [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1228.74s)]
*  and [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1237.66s)]
*  Trump got a shouted question about Elon at the end of the event and just did not take the bait [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1239.3s)]
*  But seemed angry the whole time he was at the event will revisit this tomorrow after Trump's had 12 diet cokes and [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1244.8s)]
*  Got it. It's got it. It's got his ketamine. He's got his phone. Yeah, he's got his phone back [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1252.44s)]
*  Because one thing we know about Trump over the years is he prefers his fights in the tweets not in the streets [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1257.36s)]
*  And so I can see him I could see him launching tonight on true social [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1261.98s)]
*  Yeah, there's gonna be a there's gonna be a seat caught threat at some point [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1267.96s)]
*  There is I mean not to get into the weird that like the nerdy communications this but Elon Musk is [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1271.72s)]
*  Tweeting his on a platform where everyone is with millions of people and his millions of followers and Trump is on his weird [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1278.72s)]
*  picky-une platform that has very very [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1285.4s)]
*  Very very small number of people actually on it [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1288.28s)]
*  And so he's only communicating by posting on this weird platform than other people [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1290.96s)]
*  Screenshotting his truths and then putting them on Twitter [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1295.3600000000001s)]
*  Like if he really wants to get this going he's got to get back on Twitter. That's what I would say [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1298.4s)]
*  Yeah, I will say that [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1301.96s)]
*  the the part of the co-op the MAGA coalition this time around which is you know [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1303.96s)]
*  We shorthand it is that the tech right the Silicon Valley folks the island types [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1308.6000000000001s)]
*  It's also you know when we looked at the catalyst data [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1312.48s)]
*  Trump did gain ground with college men [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1316.4s)]
*  Not just non college men and usually in the Trump era college educated [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1319.24s)]
*  Voters have not been moving towards Trump in fact [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1323.8000000000002s)]
*  They've been moving towards the Democrats and I do wonder and I don't just think it's this fight at all [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1326.84s)]
*  but I think as the Trump administration goes on some of these college men who voted for Trump in 2024 and maybe [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1332.12s)]
*  Hadn't voted it for him in 2020 or 2016 [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1340.44s)]
*  Maybe because they thought Elon Musk and other business types put their stamp of approval on Donald Trump [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1343.6399999999999s)]
*  I could see them starting to peel away from the MAGA coalition [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1349.36s)]
*  You know as time goes on yeah, I mean these are economic most likely economically centered voters [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1354.0s)]
*  And so it's less his fight with Trump [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1359.18s)]
*  Although I think increasing the deficit by trillions of dollars does not help with these voters, right? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1361.8400000000001s)]
*  I think putting in place tariffs that lead to a recession does not help with these voters and they are probably [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1366.4s)]
*  these are [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1371.5600000000002s)]
*  Profiles more likely voters. These are the sort of voters who? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1373.64s)]
*  Sat out 2016 or voted third party in 2016 or maybe voted for Trump [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1376.8400000000001s)]
*  For a Democrat 2018 and stuck with Biden and so they are target voters for 2026 for sure [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1380.78s)]
*  Yeah [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1386.5s)]
*  All that said the bills problems on the right go way beyond Elon Musk [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1387.6200000000001s)]
*  and and [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1392.74s)]
*  As you just pointed out with some of the people pissed about the deficits and the the trillions that it's adding to the deficits [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1394.66s)]
*  There's the Republicans who care about the deficit aren't happy Republicans who care that Medicaid cuts [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1400.74s)]
*  Could cost them their jobs in 2026. They aren't happy [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1405.98s)]
*  Even Marjorie Taylor Greene is unhappy saying she didn't know everything that was in the bill when she voted for it [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1409.72s)]
*  She's very upset at a provision [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1415.44s)]
*  We talked about this on offline a provision that would prevent states and local governments from regulating AI on [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1417.86s)]
*  Their own for the next most of the next decade [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1425.3999999999999s)]
*  So she's she's pissed about that [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1429.32s)]
*  Here's a sampling of some of the Republican complaints now [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1431.76s)]
*  They want me to vote for five trillion dollars worth increase in a debt ceiling and I'm just not for that. That's not conservative [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1435.56s)]
*  Here's a lesson for us all [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1442.44s)]
*  No matter what political party holds office and is in charge [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1444.76s)]
*  We should all watch carefully the bills that we pass the president the president Senate leadership has to understand that we're serious [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1449.32s)]
*  They all say oh we can pressure these guys. No, you can't this is immoral what us old farts are doing to our young people [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1458.12s)]
*  This is grotesque what we're doing. We need to own up to that. This is our moment. I can't accept this scenario [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1465.26s)]
*  I can't accept it. So I won't vote for it unless we are serious about fixing it. This is our moment old farts [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1471.62s)]
*  What do you think about that messaging slam dunk we're getting Republicans. I think this bill is bill is just [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1480.98s)]
*  Gonna be a huge political gift to the Republicans. I [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1486.5s)]
*  Mean it's like just a mean I'm obviously kidding there, but let me just put in perspective how unpopular this bill is so [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1490.0600000000002s)]
*  heart research Democratic research firm did a poll for a bunch of groups including [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1497.7s)]
*  Center for American progress protect our care family families ever billionaires and they tested the bill and [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1502.38s)]
*  Less than a third of voters support it and then they went through and they did a message exercise where they did a generic description [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1509.18s)]
*  of the bill a [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1515.46s)]
*  Democratic arguments for the bill and we're back and forth between Democratic arguments Republican arguments for the bill [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1517.42s)]
*  When they finish that the bill is nearly 30 points underwater [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1521.22s)]
*  To help you understand how unpopular that is the Trump tax cut in 2017 [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1525.38s)]
*  Which was thought to be one of the most impoverished legislation in history was about 14 points underwater when it passed in 2017 [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1530.5400000000002s)]
*  And the Affordable Care Act which is you know, like in the lore this incredibly polarizing bill that cost the Democrats 60 plus seats in 2010 [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1536.0200000000002s)]
*  That bill in the in the Kaiser family in the Kaiser Foundation tracking poll was six points above water when it passed in [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1544.4199999999998s)]
*  March of 2010 and so this is by far the least but no one is asking for this and there's no benefit coming because [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1551.4199999999998s)]
*  people aren't getting other than the exceptions around overtime and [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1557.86s)]
*  tips [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1562.5s)]
*  No one's getting new tax cuts. They're just keeping the task as they've had for four years [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1563.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and so you're not even gonna get this boost of like all of a sudden [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1568.2199999999998s)]
*  You're checking the mail with your new tax cut or your paychecks gonna look larger. That's not what's gonna happen [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1571.66s)]
*  It's just status quo for everyone other than people are gonna lose their health care in their food assistance and [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1576.42s)]
*  So far the biggest challenge for those of us who oppose this bill [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1582.8200000000002s)]
*  Has been that not enough people have heard about it and people aren't paying attention [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1587.26s)]
*  data for progress did a poll also and also found that the bill is very very unpopular but then found out that I think it [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1591.6200000000001s)]
*  Was like four percent of people had heard a lot about it was like very it was a very small number of people had [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1598.7s)]
*  Heard a lot about it. I think 14 total respondents in their open-ended thing knew the bill had Medicaid cuts [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1604.1000000000001s)]
*  14 total respondents. Yeah. Oh my god. Okay, so [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1611.18s)]
*  that's the other [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1615.18s)]
*  consequence of [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1617.02s)]
*  This being the basis for the biggest breakup of the decade [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1618.5s)]
*  Is that now people are gonna like well, how did this whole thing start and then maybe they'll look into the bill [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1624.12s)]
*  On that note, how do you think Democrats should take advantage of all this to to kill the bill? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1630.28s)]
*  it is to [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1635.1599999999999s)]
*  Like you've pointed out the fundamental [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1637.6399999999999s)]
*  Issue with the bill is that it's incredibly unpopular but not enough people know about it or paying attention to it [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1640.9199999999998s)]
*  So everyone has to find the tallest mountain they can find the biggest megaphone they can find [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1645.08s)]
*  Texts all the people they can shout about it yell about it [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1649.12s)]
*  talk about it in simple to easy to understand terms that it's essentially a [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1652.2s)]
*  tax cut for the very wealthy in corporations paid for by taking food and [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1656.44s)]
*  Health care away from millions and millions of Americans and on top of that still adds trillions of dollars to the deficit [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1661.08s)]
*  Like just everyone has to know about it when people know about it [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1667.36s)]
*  They're gonna be against it [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1670.04s)]
*  And I think there we have two tasks here [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1670.84s)]
*  If we we can there is a chance that we can create enough political pressure that they have to change what this bill looks like [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1672.8799999999999s)]
*  To take some of those cuts away [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1678.0s)]
*  It's something we'll have to pass because they don't pass something we will default on our debt and everyone's taxes woke up [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1679.4s)]
*  So they'll have to pass something [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1684.52s)]
*  But we get the potential to change the nature of what that is by making it as politically painful as possible [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1685.48s)]
*  Elon Musk is helping us do that. He's not making the arguments that we would be making [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1690.6s)]
*  He's not out there defending Medicaid [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1694.52s)]
*  But he as you say he's drawing attention to it and putting a spotlight on it and we can then [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1696.0s)]
*  Come in follow in in the breach and make our arguments [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1700.0s)]
*  Yeah, and I says, you know [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1703.2s)]
*  some people were concerned because as you point out he's not making the same arguments that we are and obviously [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1704.44s)]
*  It is adding trillions to the deficit [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1710.88s)]
*  He's correct about that [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1712.96s)]
*  but the reason that I think we oppose the bill and probably most I think if you ask people to choose between [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1713.88s)]
*  what they hate most Medicaid cuts and tax cuts for the rich or [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1720.8s)]
*  Adding to the deficit. I think they would choose the Medicaid cuts and the tax cuts for the rich for sure [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1725.96s)]
*  But you know Elon Musk called the bill a disgusting abomination [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1730.44s)]
*  We should call it a disgusting abomination too and we can explain why we think it's a disgusting abomination [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1734.84s)]
*  Which is maybe partly what Elon thinks but also the fact that it's gonna kick 15 million people after their health care [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1740.28s)]
*  To pay for a trillion dollars in tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1746.52s)]
*  I agree with you that the Medicaid cuts are by are much more effective all the testing shows that as an argument [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1750.28s)]
*  We have this hesitancy as Democrats because we've been burned by austerity politics in the past to talk about the deficits [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1755.84s)]
*  Yeah, but we should talk about the deficits. There are times when it makes sense to go in a deficit [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1762.28s)]
*  like after a financial crisis to save the economy to [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1767.44s)]
*  Give people money to stay alive during kovat right to like those times make sense [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1771.08s)]
*  To go into deficit to give tax cuts to rich people at a time of incredibly high interest rates were that were that? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1777.72s)]
*  Were the debt you're ranking up a risk cost so much more is [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1784.24s)]
*  Insane and it's gonna bother a lot of people and we should not shy away from that argument. Yeah [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1787.36s)]
*  We should make it and I just think you don't have to complicate the simple here [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1793.3999999999999s)]
*  Everyone hates the bill right Republicans hate it Elon Musk hates it. This person hates it [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1797.8s)]
*  You know, we have plenty of quotes now to play from all kinds of Republicans about how they hate the bill [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1802.3999999999999s)]
*  We could talk about the Medicaid cuts. We can talk about the ACA cuts [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1806.8s)]
*  There's just creating a lot of chaos around the bill about how it's intensely disliked [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1809.72s)]
*  Because if the casual news consumer if all they hear, oh, this is a bill that most people don't like [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1816.68s)]
*  That's all and then you'll get enough pressure on some of these Republicans to you know, like then they have a very thin margin [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1822.1200000000001s)]
*  They can lose three votes in the Senate and a couple more votes in the house when it goes back to the house [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1829.1200000000001s)]

*  Did you see Trump was on truth social Wednesday? I think talking about we should eliminate the debt ceiling altogether [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1839.56s)]

*  Personally, I know I know cuz he was like I agree with Elizabeth Warren on this [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1851.32s)]
*  so we'll have him mitten the coin mitten the gold coin and well, I mean there's there is a [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1855.6399999999999s)]

*  simply mitting the gold coin or someone just like just not even enforcing it which is [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1863.9199999999998s)]
*  Trump is obviously gonna try to do if [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1869.28s)]
*  Somehow we pass the we run out of money before they can get this discussing about the nation passed [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=1872.1200000000001s)]

*  Just like a purely senile president who didn't know and had any idea what he was doing. You're gonna be disappointed [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2301.3s)]
*  Like so there's that this is complete and total bullshit it is [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2307.36s)]
*  Going to be if this investigation actually moves forward if the FBI is going to start interviewing people [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2312.24s)]
*  The people around Joe Biden some of whom have already been called to Congress to testify in the congressional version of this investigation [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2317.76s)]
*  Will probably incur significant legal expenses and be exposed to risk not because of what of this ridiculous conspiracy [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2323.84s)]
*  They're just once you are being interviewed by law enforcement [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2331.52s)]
*  Social law enforcement with a malicious political intent any sort of thing can happen from that [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2335.2000000000003s)]
*  His investigation into Benghazi through the congressional investigations that led to Hillary Clinton's emails, right? [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2339.56s)]
*  They start once they start digging they can make your life very challenging if that's what they want to do [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2344.44s)]
*  Even if you never did anything wrong [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2348.1600000000003s)]
*  Let's be honest about what they're looking for here [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2349.76s)]
*  Like if he doesn't like executive orders that Joe Biden signed with an auto pen Donald Trump can [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2352.76s)]
*  Overturn those orders as he's been doing for the last couple months that he's been president all that he cares about is the pardons [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2359.2s)]
*  So he cares that Joe Biden [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2366.2799999999997s)]
*  pardoned a bunch of people or gave preemptive pardons to a bunch of people that Donald Trump would like to investigate and [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2368.24s)]
*  Potentially jail, but that's the only that's what they really care about here [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2373.12s)]
*  There's also like the drama around it and they can take revenge on on Biden and they can you know [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2376.3399999999997s)]
*  Have a bunch of headlines and give chum to the right-wing media about oh, we're finally, you know [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2381.54s)]
*  Investigating the Bidens and the cover-up and all that but really he just wants the pardons to go away [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2385.3199999999997s)]
*  Then how you would ever possibly do that the auto pen? There's no I don't know that Joe Biden [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2390.72s)]
*  There's no evidence that you're buying auto pen those pardons. I would be shocked if he did [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2396.04s)]
*  but even if he had that has been the auto pen is [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2400.24s)]
*  Been treated by the courts as legally as a legally recognized way of executing laws and executive orders and things like pardons [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2405.16s)]
*  And even know what it would mean the first time he threw out this allegation [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2413.72s)]
*  You know people dug up video after video picture after picture of Joe Biden Joe Biden signing legislation himself [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2417.4s)]
*  I realized it was probably just the body double but you know [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2423.7599999999998s)]
*  At least that's out there and that's gonna be tough for courts to figure out if it was the body double or the real Joe [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2427.88s)]
*  Biden did you see that Elon Musk also suggested that there was a Trump body double? Yes. Yeah [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2432.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. Someone should look into that too. You know, maybe who was signing his legislation [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2436.52s)]
*  Here from these 2028 kit Democratic candidates about what their plan for that is if they win that [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2441.56s)]
*  so Trump or [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2446.88s)]
*  The Trump body double or the auto pen also signed two more orders both touching on immigration [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2448.92s)]
*  One is a revival of his notorious first-term travel ban [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2454.18s)]
*  This one's gonna take effect on June 9th and banned citizens of 12 countries from entering the US [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2458.92s)]
*  Supposedly in the name of fighting terrorism. Those countries are Afghanistan Myanmar Chad Republic of the Congo [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2464.64s)]
*  Equatorial Guinea [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2470.56s)]
*  Eritrea Haiti Iran Libya Somalia Sudan and Yemen [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2472.48s)]
*  It also partially restricts travel from seven under seven other countries including Cuba and Venezuela [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2476.4s)]
*  We knew at some point this would be coming because Trump signed an order on inauguration day [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2482.7000000000003s)]
*  Directing relevant departments to identify countries where they could implement such a ban [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2487.04s)]
*  So obviously there was a lot of other news today to cover besides the travel ban [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2492.58s)]
*  But I would say fairly muted response [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2496.8s)]
*  Considering that last time he tried a travel ban when he first came into office in 2017 [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2500.2000000000003s)]
*  People flooded the airports and he had to pull back also because it was poorly written [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2505.88s)]
*  From a legal perspective and the courts kind of threw it out and then eventually they got to the point where it could pass muster [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2512.48s)]
*  At least with the Supreme Court [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2518.3s)]
*  What do you think's going on there with the with the response? [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2520.5400000000004s)]
*  I think it is a sort of a dark and deeply depressing statement about where we've gone after the last [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2523.4s)]
*  Seven years now eight year eight years now [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2530.92s)]
*  It you know, I think about myself [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2533.52s)]
*  I was I headed directly to the San Francisco Airport after that was signed and protested with thousands of other people there and [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2535.2400000000002s)]
*  What has happened I think is [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2542.1200000000003s)]
*  Trump's you know bigoted [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2545.28s)]
*  jingoistic [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2548.52s)]
*  Nationalistic politics has become normalized in a way like in 2017 [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2549.88s)]
*  It was possible to imagine that the president United States the president of the United States would ban travel [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2554.1000000000004s)]
*  to people from Muslim countries because they're Muslim like that was the context for and people reacted to that with [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2561.56s)]
*  outrage and fervor and [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2567.56s)]
*  Just that sort of that is it's not that is acceptable [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2569.4s)]
*  I'm not saying people except they don't I'm not saying people like this [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2572.6800000000003s)]
*  But it isn't this we are no longer shocked by these sorts of things right when you're living in a world where [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2575.0s)]
*  The president is sending people without due process to a torture prison in El Salvador [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2580.3999999999996s)]
*  These things do not seem as shocking as they were before and that is ultimately that is Trump winning [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2584.56s)]
*  That's our authoritarians take power is that people lose the ability to be outraged at things very very worthy of that outrage [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2589.48s)]
*  Yeah [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2595.8399999999997s)]
*  And substantively you could argue that the travel ban has been overtaken by much more extreme [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2596.3599999999997s)]
*  Immigration and deportation policies like you just mentioned with CICOT also like they suspended all [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2601.92s)]
*  refugees the refugee resettlement program in this country except for the [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2607.7999999999997s)]
*  Afrikaner farmers [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2611.52s)]
*  And and a host of other immigration actions that seem far more extreme even than the travel ban [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2613.04s)]
*  Even though the travel ban is horrific [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2619.56s)]
*  So the other order he signed is one that bans Harvard from being able to enroll new international students [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2621.7599999999998s)]
*  Last month Trump tried to revoke Harvard certification in the government student and exchange visitor program [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2629.12s)]
*  Which a judge blocked while the court case proceeds this time Trump's arguing that he has a national security [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2634.2s)]
*  justification under the immigration and nationality act [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2640.84s)]
*  So it was the State Department and DHS last time that tried to block the international students [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2643.64s)]
*  That's currently going through courts that the the judge temporarily blocked now. I think this is a legal [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2649.98s)]
*  Sort of effort to say well, this is a presidential power now and [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2656.4s)]
*  This is a national security thing and so courts should not intervene because it's the president's power. It's article 2 [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2660.36s)]
*  This is like their theory, you know the unitary executive theory [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2665.92s)]
*  and so [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2669.52s)]
*  It's obviously almost certainly going to court [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2671.28s)]
*  But what do you think is it just they're just gonna keep fighting Harvard here [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2674.68s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's two things happening here the first is I think Trump just likes fighting with Harvard [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2680.24s)]
*  I think he thinks it's good politics to fight with the most elite of elite institutions it [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2687.2799999999997s)]
*  Sort of I think in his mind creates is this anti establishment anti elite populist persona [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2692.4799999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it's like elites and he gets to he gets to attack elites and foreigners and one and I think the other [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2698.2s)]
*  Thing is and I don't know whether this is Trump himself or this is more like the project 2025 Stephen Miller's of the world behind him is [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2704.96s)]
*  destroying [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2713.52s)]
*  Higher education in this country is a long-term conservative goal [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2714.7200000000003s)]
*  And Harvard is the easiest one to pick on there [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2718.4s)]
*  They're trying to pick on the sense that they have resources and so they're not scared like some of the other universities [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2723.0s)]
*  But they are the I think the easiest to demonize of it's the most famous schools most elite school [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2727.68s)]
*  So I think that this is part of that larger conservative project [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2733.96s)]
*  I don't know whether Trump thinks about it that way [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2737.28s)]
*  But the people behind him certainly do people writing these orders and finding these authorities do yes, certainly. Yeah for Trump. It's hard to tell [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2739.28s)]
*  there is some evidence that they at least feel the need to [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2746.76s)]
*  Sort of paint this [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2751.92s)]
*  Action as not as extreme as it is and Trump's being Trump's saying like oh, you know [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2754.04s)]
*  Chinese students are still welcome in our institutions [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2759.0s)]
*  it's just we're gonna we're gonna just look at their social media accounts and [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2761.88s)]
*  International students can still come to all to these schools into Harvard and we want to work with Harvard to fix this but Harvard is not [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2764.92s)]
*  You know, there's probably some bad ones and Harvard's not giving us a list of the bad ones are letting us check [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2771.88s)]
*  Otherwise, we're happy to have international students and I can't tell why he's doing that [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2776.88s)]
*  But you know it may suggest that they know that it's not quite popular to just say we're gonna have a ban on [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2780.84s)]
*  all international students and [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2788.3999999999996s)]
*  A ban on all Chinese students everywhere in America and we're gonna try to destroy [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2791.08s)]
*  the nation's [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2796.48s)]
*  Most elite institution one of the one of the one of the best universities in the world, right? [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2797.7999999999997s)]
*  So maybe there's a hint that they know that that's not super popular [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2802.6s)]
*  I think there's a tension at the heart of all Trump's things which is that he [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2806.12s)]
*  See what he likes to beat up on elite institutions [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2810.04s)]
*  But what he really wants more anything else is be accepted by those elite institutions [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2814.24s)]
*  Yeah, if he can't be accepted by them, then he at least wants to be feared. Yeah [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2817.68s)]
*  So, you know, obviously more bad news on immigration there, but there's been some [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2822.8399999999997s)]
*  Some slivers of good news out there on on some of these deportations and immigration [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2827.7999999999997s)]
*  so judge James Boesberg who Trump [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2833.2799999999997s)]
*  Famously does not like he ruled that using the alien enemies act to deport over a hundred [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2837.3199999999997s)]
*  Venezuelan men to El Salvador's mega prison was unlawful and that the administration has to provide habeas relief to them [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2843.44s)]
*  Of course, the Supreme Court unanimously believes that as well [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2849.9s)]
*  So we'll see if he actually follows but then there's a couple cases that we have talked about [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2852.48s)]
*  last episode and and prior to that [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2857.2799999999997s)]
*  That we should update you on the Missouri woman from Hong Kong named Carol who we spoke about last episode [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2860.56s)]
*  She's lived 20 years in a very rural Trumpy area of Missouri it was like 80% Trump and [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=2868.56s)]

*  We continue to await anything that shows where Joe Biden had to make a presidential decision or where national security was threatened [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3326.72s)]
*  Or where he was unable to do his job. In fact, the evidence points to the opposite. He was a very effective president [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3333.4s)]
*  What do you guys think of that response? Well, so that was the response that they gave before [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3340.4s)]
*  The book was released. Yeah, and [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3344.78s)]

*  but they have not and the truth of the matter is that the book has any number of moments where [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3354.34s)]
*  One can wonder if whatever [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3361.38s)]
*  Issues he was having did actually affect his ability to do the presidency in the way that we would want and there was actually [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3364.46s)]
*  An essay about this in slate today about one of the anecdotes that I found most disturbing which was [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3372.98s)]
*  Senator Michael Bennett from Colorado goes to the White House in June 2024 before the debate and it's an immigration event and [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3379.5s)]
*  Biden has a very unsettling kind of moment where he seems to have some sort of neurological [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3388.7799999999997s)]
*  episode in front of the cameras very quick, but he's like talking and nobody can understand what he's saying and it's not [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3394.14s)]
*  To make a point [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3402.58s)]
*  Do you know what I'm saying? Yeah, that's if you couldn't hear that that's that thing he does when he whispers to make a point [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3404.82s)]
*  Yes, anyway, it's not that these mics aren't aren't Biden level mics [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3412.2599999999998s)]
*  But it's it's he's having some moment [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3416.94s)]
*  It's like some weird thing and Senator Bennett leaves the White House and thinks to himself [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3419.38s)]
*  this is why our immigration policy is such a mess because [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3426.06s)]
*  The commander-in-chief can't manage the portfolio. He can't handle it. He'd like he can't tell people what to do [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3430.26s)]
*  Because he's not able to be engaged the way that [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3437.1800000000003s)]
*  Whether or not you like his policies and I imagine this crowd doesn't Trump or Obama or or other presidents have been able to [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3440.7400000000002s)]
*  and in fact [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3448.78s)]
*  the Department of Homeland Security Secretary [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3450.54s)]
*  Alejandro Mallorca's was waiting at the very beginning of the Biden presidency for the order to [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3453.2200000000003s)]

*  The order never came. So there are in the book moments of people wondering if he's not able to do the job [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3465.34s)]
*  Want to step back and talk about how you guys went about writing this book [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3474.98s)]

*  I don't blame them for feeling that way [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3494.8s)]
*  But but the truth is that this book came about every almost every single interview of the over 200 was done after November 5th [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3496.86s)]
*  the origins of it actually are I was on Jake show the day before the election he said I think Kamala Harris might lose and [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3504.78s)]
*  I've been thinking about this book where we examine how the Democratic Party [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3513.54s)]
*  Allowed Trump to come back [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3518.46s)]
*  Would you be interested and like Jake and I were friendly, but we weren't like let's write a book friendly and [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3521.1s)]
*  So I was like buying dinner first. Yeah. Yeah, exactly [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3527.86s)]
*  And [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3533.02s)]
*  So I I was like sure sure. Okay, whatever and then didn't think it was gonna go anywhere and then sure enough [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3534.42s)]
*  Jake sends me a draft of the book proposal the night of November 6th and [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3541.02s)]
*  We turned in and we did all those interviews finally people that we had been cold-calling [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3546.34s)]
*  sliding into their DMS for like four years that never wanted to talk or [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3551.98s)]
*  If they did talk they weren't exactly candid because I think there was this and we can talk more about this this gripping fear [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3556.22s)]
*  That saying anything would ultimately help Donald Trump and not change Joe Biden's mind [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3562.46s)]
*  Now that was over and people were willing to finally confide [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3567.46s)]
*  You know small episodes that they had seen that troubled them that they sort of dismissed as perhaps one-offs [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3572.54s)]
*  And we're willing to sort of take us behind the scenes now many of those people are still anonymous [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3579.62s)]
*  We like every single time we always try to get people on the record [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3585.02s)]
*  Sometimes people do sometimes people don't but that's why we interviewed over 200 people [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3588.78s)]
*  Because even what they're not when they're anonymous you need more cooperation [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3592.9s)]
*  Yeah, and just because this is the writers block and this is Los Angeles where even bus drivers have screenplays [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3596.38s)]
*  I'll give you just the idea of some some of the writer stuff we did [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3601.42s)]
*  For me it just as a writer. This is my seventh book and structure is like the most important thing for me [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3606.7400000000002s)]
*  You know, I'm sure everybody here knows that George RR Martin from the Game of Thrones books [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3612.62s)]
*  Says that there are [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3617.82s)]
*  Gardeners and there are architects and I'm definitely an architect that you need to build the house and then you fill in the rooms [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3619.62s)]
*  And so we started with the structure [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3625.26s)]
*  Like here what I think the chapter should be [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3629.46s)]
*  Alex and I went back and forth and figured that out here are all the people we want to interview and then we would just [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3632.1400000000003s)]
*  Write chapters and you know when they were done [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3638.0200000000004s)]
*  they weren't done, but we would just like fill in the rooms and then go back and [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3641.0200000000004s)]
*  The biggest disagreement we had this is a very a very gratifying [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3645.46s)]
*  pleasant professional [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3650.0800000000004s)]
*  Relationship with the biggest disagreement we had was Google Doc's Doc's versus word and you let me guess you were the word [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3651.78s)]
*  Yes, I'm the word guy [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3659.6200000000003s)]
*  Listen, we wrote the other one as a word guy. I'm a Google Doc guy. Oh, thank thank God [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3662.3s)]
*  Listen we had to write the entire book in one word document that we emailed back and forth [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3668.82s)]
*  It wasn't even by chapters. Yeah, and then I'm like Jake's doing smoke signals sending his horse and buggy out [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3673.6600000000003s)]
*  Edition and as the millennial I'm like like honestly my command s buttons don't even work anymore [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3679.6200000000003s)]
*  So it was like frantically trying to save the document because it doesn't auto save like [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3685.1000000000004s)]
*  Just just we started we started with Google Docs. Okay, I'm like I'm not against Google [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3689.42s)]
*  Some people are saying that maybe you were saying you were okay with Google Docs [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3695.0s)]
*  But maybe behind the scenes weren't as capable with Google Docs [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3698.7000000000003s)]
*  But there's some evidence that maybe you'd lost a step with Google Docs [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3702.1400000000003s)]
*  True true you can't point to any evidence [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3708.94s)]
*  This is a cover-up [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3712.82s)]
*  so but I will say this once so we you know, we had a list of [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3714.7400000000002s)]
*  200 plus people that we wanted to interview and we we are interviewed almost every single person [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3719.6200000000003s)]
*  Google Docs stops at a hundred, right? So we had so at the next time we had so we had two different lists of Google Docs [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3725.0600000000004s)]
*  This is too much in the Google Docs weeds [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3732.1000000000004s)]
*  But he couldn't handle the second Google the fact that there was a second Google anyway [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3734.42s)]
*  Yeah, the second Google Doc. So the book [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3738.86s)]
*  So [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3745.0600000000004s)]
*  There's you were talking about this that before the election [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3746.94s)]
*  Before Joe Biden steps aside, there's this incredible fear, right? [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3750.7000000000003s)]
*  And this is not a kind of mercenary or kind of political [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3753.98s)]
*  It's a genuine concern for the country that if if you have concerns about Joe Biden's age and you go public with those concerns [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3757.02s)]
*  That might hurt him he's not stepping aside you've done nothing to make our situation better you've made Donald Trump's situation better [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3764.62s)]
*  What is the logic? [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3771.46s)]
*  After the election for people to still be afraid to speak honestly about this including in the book you make reference to people who? [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3773.34s)]
*  Were publicly defending Biden I believe to this day while talking to you behind the scenes [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3780.38s)]
*  Yeah, and you could tell us who they are [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3786.06s)]
*  Well, you definitely know who they are [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3789.82s)]
*  But you don't know who they are so I think that there is still a tremendous amount of fear [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3792.02s)]
*  About the the anger of the Biden campaign. I mean it is odd to be attacked by [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3799.54s)]
*  Joe Biden hunter Biden Ashley Biden Naomi Biden [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3807.6600000000003s)]
*  I guess there's a wife and maybe like six grandkids that we're waiting for before we get the whole the whole set [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3811.26s)]
*  Yeah, but I mean it is it is it's not pleasant [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3818.1000000000004s)]
*  And then you know the Democratic Party is it's not like everybody. I mean I think that the book has [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3821.82s)]
*  Changed the conversation where people just now accept that what we're saying is true [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3829.98s)]
*  I mean you guys were there last year, but a lot of people were very reluctant to acknowledge this [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3834.6600000000003s)]
*  I think the book has changed the conversation [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3839.06s)]
*  But it's not as though the 2028 candidates are like are running out there [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3840.86s)]
*  We like holding the book up and saying like we need to deal with this as a party [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3845.9s)]
*  I mean people are still in denial about it. Yeah, I mean you guys use obviously the word cover-up in the title [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3849.34s)]
*  provocative intentionally, I'm sure [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3857.7000000000003s)]
*  What I have always tried to figure out is and I know you guys have said that some of the people you talk to some [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3860.86s)]
*  of the people in that inner circle like genuinely [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3866.26s)]
*  believed [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3869.86s)]
*  He's fine, or they or you at least you leave open the fact that so is it is it a cover-up if they are genuinely [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3871.3s)]
*  Thinking everyone else is crazy. We're around him all the time [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3878.86s)]
*  We think he's fine even if we all see something different. It's a great question and [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3883.2200000000003s)]
*  The reason why we use cover-up is because listen everyone knew Joe Biden was old everyone saw it the polling displayed it [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3889.78s)]
*  But even with people recognizing he was old [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3896.86s)]
*  The Joe Biden we saw on the debate stage was still very shocking to tens of millions of people and the reason it was shocking [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3900.46s)]
*  And I think the book really shows this is that debate Biden for lack of a better term [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3906.82s)]
*  That was not the first or even close to the first time he had acted that way behind the scenes and there were active [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3911.98s)]
*  Even if they would not acknowledge it to themselves by their very actions. They were trying to hide and conceal [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3918.6600000000003s)]
*  Joe Biden from acting like that in public from members of their own cabinet from members of the Democratic Party from members of Congress and [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3927.5800000000004s)]
*  Those efforts became increasingly frantic the six to eight months before the debate now your [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3935.82s)]
*  Your other question of well if they don't they don't know they're covering it up. They're not kinds that is it a cover-up [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3943.42s)]
*  You know by very virtue, you know one like quick example if you saw Joe Biden and Jill Biden on the view [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3949.1800000000003s)]
*  Just like two weeks ago, you know [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3954.96s)]
*  She's doing what she has been doing for the last year and a half [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3957.02s)]
*  Which is she sort of helps him out when he's like struggling [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3959.7000000000003s)]
*  She'll jump in and like sort of complete sentences. No, I'm sure she'll say he's fine. He's great [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3963.14s)]
*  But by her very actions she is showing that she recognizes that he needs her to pick up the she is trying to pick up [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3968.3799999999997s)]
*  His slack. I think actually that the statement that they've given [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3976.3399999999997s)]
*  Suggests that they know [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3982.02s)]
*  He couldn't do the job 24-7. They don't dispute. I mean we [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3984.5s)]
*  What we have in the book, I don't know how many people have actually read the book [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3990.12s)]
*  But but what we have in the book is these aren't like our [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3992.76s)]
*  Conclusions based on like what you know our view watching TV [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=3996.64s)]
*  This is based on you know more than 200 interviews with cabinet officials members of Congress [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4000.48s)]
*  Fundraisers donors, you know people who saw him up close who told us their stories [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4005.76s)]
*  So when when cabinet secretaries tell us that by the end of the Biden presidency [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4010.36s)]
*  He could not be relied upon for that proverbial 2 a.m. Phone call in the middle of the night with the national security emergency [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4015.84s)]
*  I mean, that's a big deal. That means he can't do the job of president. That's what it means [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4022.76s)]
*  I mean, that's what the job is [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4028.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm old enough to remember when Hillary was running ads against Obama in Texas saying that he couldn't be relied upon to do that because [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4029.6800000000003s)]
*  He was so inexperienced. I'm sure that's seared into your brain and John you probably wrote those [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4036.92s)]
*  It's a good ad is a good ad [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4041.96s)]
*  Just writing it together a good ad good ads don't always work [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4045.8s)]
*  Every losing campaign isn't wrong about everything [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4050.6000000000004s)]
*  But but he couldn't be counted on he couldn't be counted on for that and and their their answer [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4053.36s)]
*  They don't say in their statement [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4058.0s)]
*  You know, it's not true that he lost his train of thought in uncomfortable ways [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4061.76s)]
*  It's not true that he didn't recall the name of his national security adviser [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4065.5600000000004s)]
*  It's not true that he couldn't be relied upon for the 2 a.m. Phone call [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4068.92s)]
*  They say and his decisions were fine and you can't point to any evidence as to otherwise and I mean [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4072.96s)]
*  Yeah, I can but that's not even the point you're kind of granting the purpose the whole premise of the book [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4078.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's sort of you you there. It does sort of raise the question [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4083.44s)]
*  Well, what does it mean to be up to the job, right? [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4087.12s)]
*  And what do we require of this person and this sort of unique? [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4089.12s)]
*  Role that they play because I can see how you could say both statements are true [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4092.32s)]
*  You have this image of what a president does and it's in the room making a decision [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4097.24s)]
*  Seven people around a table they're presenting options [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4101.48s)]
*  Maybe they disagree maybe they don't and you say go or you say yes you say no and even in the book you acknowledge [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4104.0s)]
*  That when Joe Biden is in control of the schedule when it's at his time at his choosing [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4108.84s)]
*  He is can can do that task, right? [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4113.88s)]
*  But the the Bennett example is something else which is a harder to measure thing that part of the job of being president is [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4116.8s)]
*  Over time taking in information from a bunch of different people synthesizing it moving a debate forward [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4126.3s)]
*  That's never a decision right that he can no longer have that capacity in part because of his declining ability to communicate [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4132.26s)]
*  While still meeting that kind of decision-making in a meeting threshold and by the way, I believe people in his [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4138.9s)]
*  Maybe it's Jake Sullivan or Tony Blinken have said that they did have the 2 a.m. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4146.62s)]
*  Moment with him and they did feel like he was up to doing that [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4150.1s)]
*  Yeah, and I think I think your point of like what is the job of a president is a good one and [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4152.46s)]
*  So let's say we have senior officials that say that if the job is making decisions and communicating [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4160.06s)]
*  He was clearly not able to do the latter for most of the four years and it got worse [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4165.900000000001s)]
*  But also, you know what's sort of striking about their argument is they are saying yes [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4171.240000000001s)]
*  He was he couldn't communicate yes, he would ramble and stumble in meetings [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4176.74s)]
*  Yes, his schedule was often limited from 10 to 4 his energy would be bad when he got tired [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4182.18s)]
*  He became unfocused but we swear that it never affected and all those things that are signs of like decline or aging [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4188.34s)]
*  Never affected his decision-making [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4197.0199999999995s)]
*  Which I mean they don't know [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4199.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4202.22s)]
*  So let me just point to some decisions that he made that we wonder about okay [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4203.42s)]
*  First of all, there's the immigration that Senator Bennett wonders about and I think that is a fair a fair [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4209.02s)]
*  Argument to make because that is about managing. I mean Barack Obama [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4215.26s)]
*  Was you know, he pushed for immigration reform, but he also you know kept a strict border and [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4220.26s)]
*  Deported a lot of people he got a lot of flack for that as you recall he also got reelected [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4228.46s)]
*  So, I mean but I do I do think on that one [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4235.7s)]
*  The part when we could tell a whole conversation about the immigration [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4238.3s)]
*  Stance of the Democratic Party and how it evolved over the years [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4241.42s)]
*  But I do think like the die was cast in the 2020 primary when every candidate was like, yeah [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4243.86s)]
*  We'll decriminalize border crossing except for Biden but the step well [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4250.22s)]
*  Look how much was Biden involved in how much not like where's the staff although that's the point [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4254.38s)]
*  That's what we're saying [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4259.54s)]
*  But I'm saying is that what's surprising about the immigration thing is the the closest aides around him are like pretty moderate Democrats [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4260.5s)]
*  Right. It's not like a bunch of [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4268.26s)]
*  claim though the [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4270.58s)]
*  run claim the White House Chief of Staff for the first couple years [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4271.900000000001s)]
*  Became this even though he his roots were in like neo, you know new new conservative Democrats like Al Gore [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4275.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he became the hero to the progressives and I think there's an argument to be made that that he steered the ship of state [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4282.22s)]
*  To the left. Yeah, but beyond that [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4289.5s)]
*  I don't know how aware [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4292.02s)]
*  President Biden was that there were criticisms from people like [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4295.22s)]
*  Larry Summers or Jason Furman that they were putting too much money into the economy and it was going to be inflationary [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4299.46s)]
*  I don't know and now that's necessary. I'm not proving it, but I just don't know [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4305.38s)]
*  I don't know we have we have no reporting that suggests that the decisions he made about Afghanistan [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4309.1s)]
*  In 2021 were enroute in anything other than his fierce [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4315.46s)]
*  Determinative belief that he was right about Afghanistan and then Obama and the generals were wrong. Yes, okay [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4319.820000000001s)]
*  But I don't know what information he was capable of absorbing and synthesizing as you say and on and on [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4325.18s)]
*  well, I also part of this though is what I realized and I [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4333.38s)]
*  Realized in stark relief when reading the book as well is oh [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4337.379999999999s)]
*  In the same way that I think people around Biden who do not to this day believe they were part of a cover-up [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4341.62s)]
*  One of one piece of evidence being they thought he was gonna win the debate [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4346.9s)]
*  They put him out there [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4351.5s)]
*  But that over time being around someone your baseline moves my baseline moves, right? [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4353.299999999999s)]
*  Because let's say we disagree and actually I do think Biden's decision-making was was up to snuff [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4357.219999999999s)]
*  And I don't believe his actual capacity to make governing decisions was impacted part of the job of a president is persuading people to come [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4362.46s)]
*  Along if you are unable to persuade people to the correctness of your views to build a coalition either in Congress or amongst the public [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4368.14s)]
*  You're weaker. You can't get things done [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4374.86s)]
*  You can't achieve the goals you're trying to achieve and even Democrats who were making this argument that I was among them for a time [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4376.18s)]
*  that no, you can't [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4383.62s)]
*  You may have questions about his ability to communicate [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4386.46s)]
*  These right-wing fear-mongering about dementia and that he's not doing the job. That's unfair [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4388.82s)]
*  He's able to do the job of president, but I was accepting less from a president [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4393.82s)]
*  I didn't realize the cost of having the bully pulpit basically empty. Yeah, I mean it was I mean ever since television was [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4398.22s)]
*  You know was invented [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4405.82s)]
*  Communication is just an essential part of the job and you could say like that's not fair or that doesn't shouldn't matter [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4407.98s)]
*  Yeah, and I the bar was lowered like gradually because I remember when he gave the State of the Union in February of [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4414.54s)]
*  2023 and [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4422.5s)]
*  I remember watching that State of the Union without looking at Twitter and at the reaction just like how do I think he's doing? [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4423.9s)]
*  And I was like he's he got past he got through it. He's okay [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4429.94s)]
*  And then I turned to the coverage or at least like social media and everyone was like that was amazing [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4434.36s)]
*  He's great and I'm like he was good like he didn't have any stumbles and he was like quick on his feet to like joust [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4440.34s)]
*  What the Republicans but it wasn't like great and then you think to yourself and you guys talk about this in the book a lot [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4445.780000000001s)]
*  But there's the Biden this right which is Joe Biden forever [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4451.74s)]
*  When he was much younger was still long-winded gives very long answers tell stories very gaff prone [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4457.22s)]
*  And so as he gets older and especially as he gets into this term as president you're like is that just Joe Biden? [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4464.34s)]
*  Being the typical Joe Biden who tells really long stories [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4471.66s)]
*  stumbles gaffs that he's been doing forever or is it something else and I do think that was it was [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4475.780000000001s)]
*  Legitimately difficult to figure that out. So I'm from Philadelphia. So Joe Biden has been on my TV since I was three [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4481.5s)]
*  Because Delaware is such a small state they don't have a media market they rely on ours a lot of toll booths [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4490.38s)]
*  But no media market. Yeah [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4495.38s)]
*  and [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4497.58s)]
*  So the very first I was a cartoonist in college and the very first cartoon I did [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4499.46s)]
*  For the Daily Dartmouth was making fun of Joe Biden for his plagiarism scandal [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4505.900000000001s)]
*  So this is somebody you [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4512.1s)]
*  From forever [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4514.1s)]
*  No, it's actually new information to me I was [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4516.780000000001s)]
*  I when I worked for salon comm I interviewed or I was part of a briefing that he did in 2001 [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4521.06s)]
*  So I'm I've been aware of this guy for a long long time and the Biden is and this is this is in the book [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4528.06s)]
*  And it's an important part of not to let anybody off the hook [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4534.14s)]
*  But it's an important part of why for some people it was difficult to understand what was going on with him [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4537.34s)]
*  Is that he's always been long-winded. He's always told long pointless stories [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4543.66s)]
*  He's he's he's always been a blowhard [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4548.98s)]
*  And he's always been gaffe prone and in fact, it's really remarkable the degree to which his vice presidential staff [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4553.0199999999995s)]
*  reinvented him as [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4562.54s)]
*  the cool avuncular [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4564.26s)]
*  Uncle with the aviators and the ice cream and the Camaro [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4566.74s)]
*  This crowd looks like they're at least my age and so like, you know [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4571.22s)]
*  Like there was a time when he was just kind of known as a blowhard senator. In fact not to bring up another [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4574.42s)]
*  Uncomfortable moment from the Obama campaign, but here I go [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4582.34s)]
*  So I'm memory if only there was some we could harness it [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4586.0199999999995s)]
*  To generate some sort of renewable energy. You can buy original sin [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4591.14s)]
*  profile of Barack Obama in Rolling Stone magazine in [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4596.14s)]
*  2007 or 2008 and there is a moment where Barack Obama is sitting in a hearing and the chairman of the committee unnamed is [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4599.700000000001s)]
*  Speaking and blah blah blah blah blah blah and Barack Obama writes on a piece of paper and hands it to Gibbs Robert Gibbs [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4607.34s)]
*  Shoot me now [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4613.3s)]
*  Yeah, who's the chairman and what's the committee? Yeah, Joe Biden Senate foreign relations [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4615.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, and look that was that had been my impression of Joe Biden until he was vice president and we all work [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4621.14s)]
*  President and I do think created I do think there was part of him that was like he wanted to he did want to show some [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4628.66s)]
*  Discipline as vice president he had ascended to this role and he's just I mean for all the blowhard and the stories [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4634.54s)]
*  He was also like such a good human being and he was like very grounded and I think the relationship and we can talk about [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4639.860000000001s)]
*  Where it ended up but the relationship between he and Obama which started as okay. This is a partnership [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4646.66s)]
*  It makes sense to you. They became really really close by the end of those four years [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4651.9400000000005s)]
*  And then I think beyond that we all know what happened. Yeah, no, but my point is just that that Biden is [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4657.74s)]
*  In the book we have AIDS who are like, well, is he just telling a story? [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4665.34s)]
*  like he always does or is this something else is he just being completely inappropriate because he's [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4669.78s)]
*  79 or has he always been completely inappropriate? We have a one European leader [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4675.98s)]
*  Sitting down having a meeting with Biden during his presidency and Biden just [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4682.14s)]
*  blah blah blah and like completely misses the brief does not talk about what he's supposed to and [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4687.7s)]
*  This leader says something but he's always been a bit like that, right? [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4692.66s)]
*  I mean, you know, so it was not necessarily [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4695.62s)]
*  People didn't notice it at first [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4699.0199999999995s)]
*  Well, and this is I mean in in some like this story is very familiar [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4701.22s)]
*  I think to basically everybody who has an aging relative, right? [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4705.98s)]
*  And you know is the relative doing X because there's something off or just because they're just being themselves and they're just older [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4709.94s)]
*  You know and but in this case it happened on the largest stage [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4717.78s)]
*  With like potential consequences for all of us and that's also I mean to you know, we're poking fun in them a little bit [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4722.339999999999s)]
*  But you know, that's why we framed the book as a tragedy because he is a good [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4727.54s)]
*  I mean by all like he is a good man and a well-intentioned one and he was undone [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4732.62s)]
*  By both power his own ego and his own like, you know [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4738.900000000001s)]
*  I think in some ways a virtue of never giving up that became sort of a tragic vice was also I think there's a [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4743.34s)]
*  Another more generous version of Biden is too, which is something I felt even in the days after the debate which is [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4749.860000000001s)]
*  Part of why I think we would watch that State of the Union or other big Biden moments and feel like am I misreading this? [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4758.06s)]
*  Is he doing better than I feel is because even in in past debates [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4764.22s)]
*  There was a sense that you know what the the people that are hyper engaged in politics people that have maybe been writers in their [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4770.1s)]
*  lives watch it in a different way in a more kind of [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4776.860000000001s)]
*  persnickety and [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4780.700000000001s)]
*  kind of like like the Russian judges kind of grading on points watching for style are more sis more [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4782.22s)]
*  No, they already know what Biden thinks they already know his policy views so they're watching the language [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4790.22s)]
*  They're watching the stumbles [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4794.26s)]
*  but people that are just trying to understand what he stands for and what he believes and who he is as a person aren't feeling that and [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4795.14s)]
*  the other part of this too is [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4800.22s)]
*  He was underestimated. That's a wrong claim point [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4802.54s)]
*  Throughout his life and as a candidate, you know that he was underestimated in the 2020 primaries [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4805.86s)]
*  He pulls it out. He in the first two years of his administration [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4810.900000000001s)]
*  I think [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4815.04s)]
*  governs in an extraordinary way has achievements through Congress that a lot of people thought were [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4815.92s)]
*  Impossible place his hand as well as anybody could possibly play it [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4820.84s)]
*  And I remember when Dean Phillips first jumps in one of the challenges he has is age was the critique, right? This is before [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4825.08s)]
*  October 7th and a lot of the fallout that caused and and I think part of what you cover in the book does reveal why he [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4832.08s)]
*  Had such trouble communicating and also adjusting [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4837.16s)]
*  But it was hard to make an argument against Joe Biden especially in [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4840.76s)]
*  the first two years of his term because it was hard to point to moments where age really had limited his ability to govern when [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4845.48s)]
*  You look at the legislative achievements when you look at [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4852.0s)]
*  His response to the pandemic and and the economic crisis [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4855.08s)]
*  So I do think that was part of it too that a lot of people had felt [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4858.24s)]
*  Uncertain about their own judgment [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4863.56s)]
*  Especially in a world where Donald Trump could win and Joe Biden was the only person who could beat him that who are we to question? [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4865.2s)]
*  The people around Joe Biden when he'd been so successful [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4871.28s)]
*  Yeah, I mean you remember during the 2019 2020 Democratic primary when Joe Biden was like [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4873.76s)]
*  I'm gonna be able to negotiate with Mitch McConnell. There were little guffaws [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4880.04s)]
*  from the base of the party and [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4884.5199999999995s)]
*  Joe Biden passed an infrastructure bill with I think 19 Senate Republicans [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4886.8s)]
*  Don't quote me on that but like and then did an event in early 2023 with Mitch McConnell in [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4891.32s)]
*  Kentucky and Mitch McConnell called the infrastructure bill a legislative miracle [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4898.2s)]
*  So you could also imagine how Joe Biden and the people, you know in his inner circle who had felt underestimated who had [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4902.18s)]
*  Listened to the people laughing at them. We're saying oh, you know, but that also created this insularity [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4909.76s)]
*  Yeah, where eventually they would not listen to outside critics even well-intentioned ones [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4915.400000000001s)]
*  America loves an underdog and Joe Biden has been an underdog throughout his life and [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4920.679999999999s)]
*  One of the qualities that the American people [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4926.919999999999s)]
*  Love about him [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4929.96s)]
*  Admire about him is his ability to get up off the ground after [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4931.96s)]
*  Fate or God or whatever has thrown something horrible at him whether it's a debilitating stutter or [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4938.24s)]
*  That horrible car accident that took the life of his wife and daughter and sent his two sons to the hospital in 1972 or [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4945.080000000001s)]
*  his brain aneurysms in 1988 and on and on and on and [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4953.04s)]
*  What is what makes this a tragedy is that it's that quality that makes it [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4960.72s)]
*  So he can't see when it is actually time to give up [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4966.72s)]
*  Because he has been so determined to fight [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4971.4400000000005s)]
*  And achieve and do good things for the country. He's not [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4976.360000000001s)]
*  He's not I mean members of his family might be but he's not trying to enrich himself as president of the United States [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4980.72s)]
*  and then the other tragedy about this story is that he defined his presidency as a battle for the soul of [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4987.280000000001s)]
*  America to save America from Trump and Trumpism and [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4995.16s)]
*  Because of those decisions he made to run for reelection and to hide what was happening to him [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=4999.04s)]
*  He delivered the country back into the hands of Donald Trump. Yeah, and look this is why [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5004.32s)]
*  You know at reading your book and just having experienced the last couple years, you know [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5010.599999999999s)]
*  Like I have anger towards Joe Biden. I think I have more anger, especially after reading your book at the [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5015.2s)]
*  towards the like [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5021.679999999999s)]
*  Close group of advisors that kept most of the other White House staff campaign staff [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5023.12s)]
*  pollsters everyone else at bay and and no one thought to themselves [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5029.2s)]
*  Can this guy really do it? Is this a good idea? I thought one of the most shocking [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5034.36s)]
*  revelations in the book for me was [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5038.98s)]
*  You talked about you talked to some people who worked for Biden back in 2020 and you write that ahead of the Democratic National Convention in [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5041.72s)]
*  2020 [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5049.08s)]
*  Biden did a series of zooms to produce a campaign video of him talking to voters and one Democrat you talked to said [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5050.2s)]
*  Who is working with the Biden campaign? It was like a different person. This was like watching grandpa who shouldn't be driving [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5056.4s)]
*  I didn't think he could be president. This was when some top Democrats entered an angry phase [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5063.12s)]
*  I became disillusioned with the entire apparatus because what I was seeing on this video in 2020 [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5068.88s)]
*  That means people working for him every day see this [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5074.12s)]
*  Did you did anyone else tell you that they had concerns as far back as 2020 a [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5077.48s)]
*  small handful of people who had known him for a long time [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5084.08s)]
*  One said that the first time that they noticed any sort of deterioration [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5089.28s)]
*  Came after his son Bo's tragic death of brain cancer in May 2015 [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5095.679999999999s)]
*  And this person this top aide said it was like watching [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5100.8s)]
*  Water poured on sand what happened to Biden's psyche? [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5105.200000000001s)]
*  And then there were people that popped in on him in 2017 2018 [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5109.360000000001s)]
*  Before he ran who said it seemed as though he'd aged ten years [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5114.120000000001s)]
*  in in one or two [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5117.64s)]
*  And then in the her report when Robert her does his special counsel report on Biden's mishandling of classified information [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5120.080000000001s)]
*  one of the things [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5126.92s)]
*  That one of the reasons they conclude that they can't prosecute Biden successfully even though they conclude he did [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5128.4400000000005s)]
*  Break the law with them with the classified information was not just the interview they did with Biden in October [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5134.52s)]
*  2023 that the audio of which was released a few weeks ago [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5142.0s)]
*  But because of the audio the tapes that they had of Biden talking to his ghostwriter in [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5145.76s)]
*  2017 2018 where it sounds like [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5152.200000000001s)]
*  Debate Biden or for wanting of a want of a better term [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5156.280000000001s)]
*  Non-functioning by where he is not clear on dates where he's not clear on situations [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5160.16s)]
*  and he loses his train of thought in a major way and [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5167.0s)]
*  Alex had great reporting in the book that suggested that aides said would privately acknowledge [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5172.32s)]
*  That while kovat was one of the worst things to happen to the United States [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5178.719999999999s)]
*  It was one of the best things to happen to Joe Biden's presidential campaign in 2020 because he could run from his basement [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5182.16s)]
*  Yeah, I still I also can't believe that [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5189.92s)]
*  There was no real discussion or debate among Biden and [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5195.839999999999s)]
*  Even his broader circle of advisors senior staff about running for reelection in [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5203.04s)]
*  2024 particularly because you know he talks about himself in the 2020 campaign now famously as [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5210.24s)]
*  You know I'm nothing more than a bridge to this generation of new leaders behind me. He also says in 2020 [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5216.639999999999s)]
*  I'm just a transitional candidate, so he doesn't take a one-term pledge, but [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5223.32s)]
*  Makes it seem like he may only serve one term and then I [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5229.719999999999s)]
*  Remember thinking to myself like is he gonna run for reelection like it doesn't seem like and then we did well in the midterms [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5235.5199999999995s)]
*  And I was like oh, I wonder if I wonder if they're gonna have a debate about this [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5241.679999999999s)]
*  But it sounds like there was no real meeting discussion anything yeah, and what's sort of shocking is one of the most consequential [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5244.96s)]
*  political decisions perhaps in American history of is how little process there actually was and [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5252.36s)]
*  Basically what happened was Joe Biden who you know we were someone close to him said he is nothing if not for this [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5259.28s)]
*  And it's the guy that had been thinking about being president as soon as he was constitutionally eligible to be president and that was in [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5265.68s)]
*  1977 [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5271.92s)]
*  and he [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5274.719999999999s)]
*  Basically he wanted to run for reelection [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5277.799999999999s)]
*  The first lady wanted him to run for reelection [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5281.719999999999s)]
*  Somebody equated Joe Biden like a long-term advisor there was this metaphor. He's like a shark [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5285.08s)]
*  he just has to keep swimming or he'll die and [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5289.5599999999995s)]
*  And basically need therapy [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5293.16s)]
*  If you're a man here [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5297.679999999999s)]
*  And you're not in therapy [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5300.68s)]
*  Do a favor for your wife [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5304.280000000001s)]
*  Or husband thanks Jake [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5307.280000000001s)]
*  Gaysplain to me during fucking pride [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5311.0s)]
*  Somebody needed to gaze plane. I'm sorry. I was right here. Sorry I interrupted now [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5316.0s)]
*  But yeah, I mean [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5322.280000000001s)]
*  Basically like [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5324.28s)]
*  Just as I was gonna run Jill and Hunter were completely on board and [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5326.92s)]
*  You know and we can get in the hunter stuff later if you want to but you know hunter it obviously [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5331.08s)]
*  You know spiraled and I think saw in his dad's presidency [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5335.92s)]
*  in the fight against Trump sort of a chance to redeem himself and [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5340.48s)]
*  Also a way if we're being honest to stay out of prison [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5344.88s)]
*  And I think basically the family decided and when anybody in the inner circle was like are we gonna talk about this [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5347.6s)]
*  Are we gonna have a real discussion debate word came down from Mike Donilon said presidents decided it's over and [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5354.6s)]
*  You know in fairness like even those that had concerns none of them ever gotten Joe Biden's face [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5361.4800000000005s)]
*  You could say that's part because of their own [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5368.120000000001s)]
*  You know cowardice or also because of the culture that bought Joe Biden's life [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5370.400000000001s)]
*  Also because of the culture that Biden and the family in particular had created where dissent or questioning [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5375.4s)]
*  Was immediately suspect like suspect suspected as this loyalty Barack Obama went by the White House in spring [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5382.4s)]
*  summer 2023 [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5389.92s)]
*  To kind of kick the tires and see if this was a good idea and at that point their their relationship was was strained enough because [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5391.96s)]
*  As Obama would put it when people would say to him are you [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5399.96s)]
*  Is Biden really gonna run for reelection you should talk to him and it's and he would say like you know [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5403.48s)]
*  He's he's still pissed at me for backing Hillary in 2016 [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5408.32s)]
*  So their relationship was at the point where he Obama didn't feel like he could say [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5413.32s)]
*  Hey, you should you should think twice about this [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5419.36s)]
*  The Hillary thing like this it's not it's not true [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5422.16s)]
*  Well the timeline on this is also I think it's confusing for people because the way the story is told [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5426.16s)]
*  It's like the beginning of the 2016 race and it's Hillary and Bernie and Joe Biden and Obama's like and I pick Hillary [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5431.64s)]
*  And that's not what happened at all what happened was Joe bow dies and Joe Biden is [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5439.54s)]
*  mourning his son [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5445.4400000000005s)]
*  Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton enter the race they have [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5447.4400000000005s)]
*  Six seven months of campaigning there. They have organizations in Iowa ten months ten months [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5451.76s)]
*  Okay, ten months of campaigning in the book just so you know this he this is it's just he's not lecturing us [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5456.4800000000005s)]
*  He wants to make sure you know well because it just gets confusing about like what and so Joe Biden [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5461.360000000001s)]
*  contemplates in the fall a late entry into the race [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5466.4400000000005s)]
*  after Hillary and Bernie had already been campaigning against each other forever and have these big organizations in Iowa and then goes [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5470.0s)]
*  To Obama and is like can I jump into the race this late and Obama's like well [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5476.0s)]
*  If you jump into the race this late a [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5480.58s)]
*  Probably it's gonna help Bernie Sanders win because Hillary and Biden would split the vote of like non-progressives [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5483.58s)]
*  And also was genuinely concerned you guys write this in the book genuinely concerned about him because he's still grieving his son [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5489.9400000000005s)]
*  And but that you know it became in Biden's brain [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5497.900000000001s)]
*  And look we write about this in the book [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5503.54s)]
*  The Biden mythology and all politicians have their own mythology, but part of it by [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5505.82s)]
*  2019-2020 it had it had changed into a theology [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5512.98s)]
*  Where there was just this faith and it's just it's a small cult of people who believed in it [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5517.099999999999s)]
*  But there was but like all religions [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5522.92s)]
*  skeptics were not allowed [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5525.66s)]
*  and [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5527.46s)]
*  this belief and part of this mythology or theology is [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5528.54s)]
*  Barack didn't back me in 2016 [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5532.74s)]
*  Which is also one of the reasons why although Alex and I differ on why did Biden endorse Kamala so quickly [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5535.62s)]
*  My version is the is the more charitable one [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5542.74s)]
*  Which is he's proud of the fact that he picked Kamala Harris to be his vice president not so much for Kamala Harris [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5545.66s)]
*  but because of what she represents and [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5551.7s)]
*  He doesn't want to do to her what he thinks Obama did to him which as you note is not really accurate [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5553.98s)]
*  It's revisionist history, but that's how he thinks of it [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5561.22s)]
*  And I think that what Jake said is true [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5564.18s)]
*  I just also think that Biden as he is you know fuming is like oh you're gonna kick me out you get Kamala [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5566.700000000001s)]
*  You know like you're not gonna be able to get the open process that you guys want that Obama wants that Pelosi wants [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5574.58s)]
*  Like I get to choose [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5580.9800000000005s)]
*  Who it is and also I'm gonna show what it means to really be loyal to my vice president [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5582.9400000000005s)]
*  And this is one of the few areas of disagreement. There's word versus Google Docs [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5588.9800000000005s)]
*  This is what motivates him and and we've learned in our San Francisco leg of the tour [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5593.14s)]
*  He thinks that the rock is a good movie. That's another [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5598.62s)]
*  These are oh, I'm with Alex. Thank you [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5602.06s)]
*  feet [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5606.06s)]
*  Opinion is that the rock is not a good movie [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5607.46s)]
*  Man the people are with me Jake [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5612.46s)]
*  But [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5614.78s)]
*  But I will say you know and you guys saw this that resentment toward Obama and I [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5617.7s)]
*  We got some of that too. Well this like you remember in 2019 [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5623.82s)]
*  Biden would not appear on pod save America [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5627.7s)]
*  I think every every Democrat running for president appeared on pod save America every [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5629.7s)]
*  Democrat appeared on the axe files with former Obama advisor David Axelrod Joe Biden didn't and I mean you think he did in the general [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5633.94s)]
*  Actually, we got him [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5641.5s)]
*  Well, whenever Joe Biden comes on pod save America, he does win [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5644.46s)]
*  One and one [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5648.54s)]
*  There is the one Biden aid said to us that [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5650.26s)]
*  When he's talking about the elites [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5655.7s)]
*  He's talking about Obama. Yeah, which is which it's just it's it's sad and I don't like just probably talking about us, too [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5658.74s)]
*  But I'm just saying like Obama is definitely in his brain when he's thinking that here's the other thing [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5667.22s)]
*  I've always wondered too like as so he decides he's gonna run again and [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5671.7s)]
*  I think a lot of people are like well, why why didn't the Democratic Party do something? Why didn't someone get involved? [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5676.3s)]
*  Did you guys in your reporting? [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5682.46s)]
*  Hear anything about other potential candidates in 2024 like were some of them getting ready? [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5684.9s)]
*  Were they thinking about it because honestly like they are as [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5691.98s)]
*  Responsible like someone would have had to run against him and we would always because people like our our staff was like [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5696.74s)]
*  Why is Joe Biden the one and other people and I'd be like look [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5702.98s)]
*  Someone's got to run against him [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5706.86s)]
*  You know then you guys interviewed Dean Phillips like MSNBC would not even have Dean Phillips on you guys like did a tough like [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5709.54s)]
*  Good interview with him. Yeah and was not and look and we were I [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5716.5s)]
*  During that interview I was like well I get why someone is running against Joe Biden [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5720.5s)]
*  It didn't seem like he had and he did it in fairness to Dean Phillips. He was like look [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5724.7s)]
*  No one else would do it. Yeah, he tried to get Whitmer Pritzker [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5729.18s)]
*  Newsome, but she he tried to get them to run [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5733.62s)]
*  Some of them wouldn't even take his call [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5737.26s)]
*  Bill Daley Obama's former chief of staff former Clinton commerce commerce secretary. He tried to get people to run [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5739.7s)]
*  Nobody would do it [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5747.16s)]
*  you know there isn't a very long proud history of people challenging incumbent presidents and [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5748.719999999999s)]
*  Defeating them in primaries usually what happens is Ted Kennedy being what the one exception usually you go off into [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5754.92s)]
*  Disgrace right people still though were mad at Ted Kennedy for sense and not centuries for decades [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5761.679999999999s)]
*  Well, it felt like centuries to her for for you know blaming him for you know weakening Jimmy Carter [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5767.92s)]
*  I mean, it's it's stupid. It's as revisionist, but [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5773.88s)]
*  There were [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5778.08s)]
*  candidates [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5779.96s)]
*  That were up until the end of 2023 [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5781.12s)]
*  watching to see if Joe Biden was actually going to go through with us and [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5785.0s)]
*  There were maybe five or six that could have on a dime [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5788.28s)]
*  Put a campaign together. I think Newsome [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5794.04s)]
*  Harris [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5797.72s)]
*  Whitmer [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5799.04s)]
*  Buttigieg [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5800.52s)]
*  Maybe Pritzker [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5802.0s)]
*  There was and Klobuchar they could have they but nobody [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5806.64s)]
*  Was gonna do it against him. Yeah, there was sort of a just-in-case primary like going on [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5810.72s)]
*  I mean you had Pritzker Newsome like cutting checks for like the the Charleston, South Carolina mayoral race in [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5816.12s)]
*  2023 I'm sure it was [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5823.68s)]
*  Completely just good intention of the kindness their hearts to get involved in those races [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5826.44s)]
*  And yeah that they like there was quietly everyone's fishing and it got to the point actually in early 2024 where [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5831.96s)]
*  Biden campaign chair Jenna Malley Dillon actually starts calling some of the governors and be like and feels like they're sort of subtly [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5840.28s)]
*  Trying to undermine Biden. She hears that governor [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5847.76s)]
*  Governor Healey of Massachusetts is talking up Whitmer. Yeah, and she and O'Malley Dillon gets mad about it [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5852.88s)]
*  I will say though something that is very specific to where we are as a country right now is [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5859.44s)]
*  First of all, there is very little incentive for courage built into our politics [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5866.04s)]
*  People are all about the base and all about not rocking the boat. Second of all [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5870.08s)]
*  Parties are so weak right now [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5875.879999999999s)]
*  This is a smart crowd so I'm not gonna I'm not gonna ask can you name who was DNC chair? [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5880.08s)]
*  during the Biden presidency Jamie Harrison, but [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5884.799999999999s)]
*  I had to beat you to it, but but [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5887.92s)]
*  This was not somebody who was brought in because he was gonna be able to tell Joe Biden some hard truths [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5890.96s)]
*  Well, you know, this is there's a more Healey [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5897.2s)]
*  I think there's the things a way to get from that to some of the larger [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5899.2s)]
*  Lessons that we should take forward from this other than to probably not nominate Joe Biden in 2028, which I think we're all [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5902.76s)]
*  Settled pretty good on you. He's gonna resent the Boz of America even more now [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5909.4800000000005s)]
*  America even more now, you know, you know you joke about that [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5914.36s)]
*  They still to this day Biden and his top aides say that he could have won [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5918.2s)]
*  Could have beaten Trump and he could serve as president until January [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5924.84s)]
*  2029 I just think that's sad and they still argue that point [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5930.2s)]
*  But the the the I think this gets at what I was gonna point out from the book [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5934.599999999999s)]
*  There's a moment with Maura Healey where she's walking out of the I guess the White House and she says to Rashad I'd love [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5940.08s)]
*  To see the polling and he's like I know polling [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5946.4s)]
*  And I believe it's directly to you as it as a quote where she says there's no chessboard [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5948.84s)]
*  Some to paraphrase there's no one pulling those the strings behind the scenes [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5956.5199999999995s)]
*  There was just one old man and his enablers who refused to do the right thing [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5960.04s)]
*  it's basically what she says and [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5966.0s)]
*  That was sort of my as I'm reading the book I was like, oh my god [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5968.96s)]
*  Everyone was feeling the same way [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5974.32s)]
*  Everyone had these questions if you saw Joe Biden once at his worst you thought is this a strange aberrance? [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5976.72s)]
*  Am I seeing something at no one else is seeing I'm being reassured and it's not just people that are seeing him at town halls [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5983.12s)]
*  It's it's governors. It's senators. There was nobody [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5989.72s)]
*  Making some there was no grand. There's no grand decision being made. There was no DNC making machinations [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=5994.4800000000005s)]
*  It was just a bunch of people kind of fuddling along [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6000.72s)]
*  making the best decisions they thought they needed to make each day leading us to this kind of cataclysm and [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6004.280000000001s)]
*  the reason why [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6009.64s)]
*  They began increasingly shielding him from governors from is to make people say [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6011.200000000001s)]
*  Oh, it was just a one-off. It must have just been sort of a bad day bad hour [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6017.160000000001s)]
*  And and they were gaslighting not just like the public and reporters, but they were gaslighting [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6020.4s)]
*  You know their own members and leaders the Democratic Party members their own cabinet [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6026.92s)]
*  Yeah, and and they were one of the things we learned in this we learned so much while researching this book [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6030.839999999999s)]
*  But one of the things we learned is they weren't just hiding Biden from the world. They were hiding the world from Biden [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6036.44s)]
*  And when we talked to his pollsters [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6042.24s)]
*  They are in my view some of the most [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6045.28s)]
*  Moving and alarming sections of the book have to do with these three pollsters [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6048.32s)]
*  Most pollsters don't work in the White House pollsters always work outside of the White House [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6052.32s)]
*  And the campaign had somebody that did data, but then there are also these three pollsters [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6056.599999999999s)]
*  Three of the best in the great pollsters. Yeah, Jeff Garan and Molly Murphy and Jeffrey Pollock and they [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6062.28s)]
*  What they had data and they couldn't ever bring it to the president, which is crazy [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6069.76s)]
*  But they would bring it to Donnellan and Rashidi and then Donnellan and Rashidi would put it through the [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6075.48s)]
*  Donnellan and Rashidi eiser and present it to Joe Biden. It's a landslide bus [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6081.4s)]
*  They also they told the New Yorker that they genuinely believe that polling is broken now and so polling doesn't matter [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6089.4s)]
*  Even though they had polling that was telling them bad things [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6096.12s)]
*  And when David Plouffe came in after Biden had dropped out and he saw the actual polling and saw that not only were they gonna lose [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6099.96s)]
*  All of the battleground states and by a lot [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6107.96s)]
*  But they were on track to lose [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6112.24s)]
*  Minnesota and [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6115.76s)]
*  Colorado and Virginia and New Mexico [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6117.8s)]
*  I think was on the bubble and New Hampshire and it would have been a bloodbath and [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6121.08s)]
*  Whatever you think of Kamala Harris, she at least brought the party to treading water [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6125.5199999999995s)]
*  And so it was it was a bad night [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6131.2s)]
*  But it wasn't just a complete wipeout like it the Trump campaign believes like they would have a 57 [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6133.839999999999s)]
*  potentially a 57 seat majority in the Senate if [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6139.839999999999s)]
*  It had not been for Kamala Harris top two it's 53 right now. Just yeah for people who are normal. So [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6143.0s)]
*  Since the book you guys have taken a lot of shots [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6150.759999999999s)]
*  Since the book you guys have taken a lot of shit from both the right and [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6153.52s)]
*  And Democrats Biden supporters on the right [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6158.44s)]
*  Read the tweets, baby. Well, I'm [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6163.52s)]
*  I'm confused about this because they have accused the Trump media folks have accused you guys of being part of the cover-up [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6166.76s)]
*  That you write about actually [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6176.08s)]
*  It's not [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6178.08s)]
*  It's just me but like most a most of the information in the book you found out after the election [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6180.16s)]
*  be [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6187.28s)]
*  Before the election like people who spent time around Biden either [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6188.64s)]
*  Wouldn't talk to reporters or wouldn't tell reporters the truth. So what is the crit? [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6193.76s)]
*  What were you guys what was the media not just YouTube but like the media? [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6200.84s)]
*  I mean Alex you won an award at the Correspondence Center and even you said like this is a story [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6204.6s)]
*  We all miss and I thought that was I was like, I don't know that you guys [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6211.160000000001s)]
*  Necessarily missed the story because there wasn't a story to get if the people who could tell the story refused to tell it [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6216.120000000001s)]
*  I think [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6221.360000000001s)]
*  so a few different points on that I think [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6223.120000000001s)]
*  there is a difference between [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6226.96s)]
*  While a lot of right-wing media was right to be skeptical [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6229.240000000001s)]
*  You know of Biden's abilities there's a big difference between [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6232.599999999999s)]
*  showing on a loop him stumbling up the stairs of Air Force one and doing behind-the-scenes [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6238.5599999999995s)]
*  Reporting I also said I thought we missed a lot of the story in part because Jake and I had just done this book [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6244.88s)]
*  And I was like, holy shit [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6249.88s)]
*  There was a lot that that I didn't know now that being said I do think [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6252.84s)]
*  In particular for reporting and reporters a hinge moment is after Robert Herr's report in [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6257.64s)]
*  early 2024 in which you know [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6264.76s)]
*  He basically decides not to prosecute Joe Biden and because he says the jury would not convict such an [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6267.4s)]
*  You know an old man with a bad memory and if you look at the coverage, I think the White House [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6274.76s)]
*  Com's team, you know props then they did a very good job [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6281.04s)]
*  But I think if you look at the coverage it was not skeptical enough [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6284.0s)]
*  and I think that's if I think it you know [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6288.0s)]
*  I think the fairest critique is really those like four or five months before the debate when after the special counsel report, I think [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6291.5599999999995s)]
*  That's that's what I think like you can really I think objectively argue the media did not do a good enough job [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6301.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I I had to watch Megyn Kelly yell at you for a while I was like what I think you didn't have to I think [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6307.6s)]
*  that [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6316.04s)]
*  The conservative media [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6318.6s)]
*  We discovered while we were reporting this [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6321.72s)]
*  Was right to be skeptical skeptical of his acuity from the beginning from 2019 because our reporting suggested that it was it was an [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6325.52s)]
*  issue as far back as 2015 and [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6334.16s)]
*  so [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6336.88s)]
*  You know when I get new information I [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6338.12s)]
*  Changed my mind which is not I think a difficult thing for mature adults to do [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6341.68s)]
*  So I have I have no I have no problem [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6348.24s)]
*  Acknowledging that the skepticism in 2019 2020 about his acuity was correct [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6351.96s)]
*  I thought he was aging I didn't see acuity issues at that time. I was mistaken [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6358.4s)]
*  I think the tone and tenor of some of the criticism I think is rooted in the fact that [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6364.6s)]
*  a lot of these same people said that [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6372.84s)]
*  when Obama took office [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6377.160000000001s)]
*  He was a secret Muslim [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6379.400000000001s)]
*  That the new black panthers Panthers were going to take over the country that Hillary was going to die in [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6381.4400000000005s)]
*  2016 that the election was stolen in 2020 and [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6387.4400000000005s)]
*  On and on and on I mean the the current president just a couple days ago [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6390.96s)]
*  Shared a post that said actually Biden was executed in 2020 and it was a body double the entire time [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6397.08s)]
*  I by the way, we should have paid more for that body double. Thank you [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6403.320000000001s)]
*  Can we not get up if we're gonna replace the guy? [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6406.72s)]
*  Okay, this guy see we got a used body double do you have anything in a Ryan Reynolds? Yeah something something new off the lot here [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6412.08s)]
*  I think that they are are and and you know, they were right about this and [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6420.64s)]
*  Now again as Alex says there's a difference broken fuck, you know, what there's a difference between [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6426.84s)]
*  Calling him an applesauce head and [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6434.68s)]
*  Laughing at him and saying he needs a sippy cup and showing these clips on a loop and doing investigative reporting [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6437.52s)]
*  But that said because of what you mentioned [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6444.8s)]
*  It was a it took a lot to do investigative reporting on this and even if you go back and read [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6448.200000000001s)]
*  Some of the pieces that really were shocking at the time [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6455.360000000001s)]
*  Peter Baker wrote one in 2023 about Obama. I mean about Biden [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6459.200000000001s)]
*  Could you know how much rest they built into his schedule in terms of trips? [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6464.76s)]
*  Alex's incredible scoops about Biden's schedule [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6469.72s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal reporters Siobhan Hughes and Annie Linsky [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6474.62s)]
*  Like even if you if you go back and read those incredibly important stories that were very difficult and brought a lot of criticism to the [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6478.419999999999s)]
*  reporters [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6486.259999999999s)]
*  They're nothing compared to what we found out [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6487.419999999999s)]
*  After the election was over and people felt like okay. I don't have to worry about [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6490.419999999999s)]
*  Helping to elect Trump. He already won so now I can unburden myself. I'd also just also add to that [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6495.62s)]
*  The American people had made up their decision on Joe Biden's age they had decided he was too old to seek reelection [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6501.62s)]
*  They decided that in 2022 [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6507.78s)]
*  But so to the the idea that this is something that wasn't in front of people that wasn't a big subject of discussion [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6509.379999999999s)]
*  It was one of the most important debates. We were talking about it on Pod Save America all the time [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6514.46s)]
*  How does he address this liability? He's failing to address it and the weeks after the debate [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6518.139999999999s)]
*  It was shocking not just the performance in the debate [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6522.219999999999s)]
*  But that the obvious solution is him going out there and over and over again [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6525.219999999999s)]
*  Was not when they were taking advantage of and it's it's really [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6530.08s)]
*  Chilling to read in the book that that's not a demand being made just from people on the outside [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6533.96s)]
*  Chuck Schumer is asking that different senators are asking and Schumer concludes that he's not doing it [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6537.88s)]
*  Because he can't now. I'm sorry to do this and because I do think [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6543.639999999999s)]
*  We have some audio that I think is important to play and I think it is an indictment of you personally [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6549.5199999999995s)]
*  Jake speaking I know what this is. Okay, speaking of Chuck Schumer. Um, I did [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6554.679999999999s)]
*  Listen to part of the book in the car. I [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6559.92s)]
*  Did some on the text but some I'm excited in the car [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6564.639999999999s)]
*  Can we just play a little bit of the audio version of original sin? [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6567.36s)]
*  I'm urging you not to run [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6572.92s)]
*  Do you think Kamala can win? [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6575.88s)]
*  Biden asked I don't know if she can win Schumer said I just know that you can win [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6578.16s)]
*  I just know that you cannot [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6583.64s)]
*  Biden said that he needed a week [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6585.64s)]
*  They stood on their way out Biden put his hands on Schumer shoulders [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6588.04s)]
*  You have bigger balls than anyone I've ever met Biden told him [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6592.52s)]
*  You did a voice what the fuck was that? [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6598.200000000001s)]
*  Wow, I screwed up. I should have listened to the audio. I don't even know how it's possible that your impression of Chuck Schumer is anti-semitic [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6601.68s)]
*  You're Jewish man, you're from Philadelphia I [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6608.08s)]
*  Will tell you [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6613.64s)]
*  Wherever I go on this book tour people come and they say I'm listening to the book on tape and I love your impression [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6616.16s)]
*  That is the God's honest truth [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6624.24s)]
*  This is actually the first time I have heard that yeah me too and and I thought it was good also you did a [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6627.92s)]
*  I thought it was good. Also you did a bite you use a mark the bite [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6633.04s)]
*  I was holding back because I didn't want it to be full anti-semitic. Yeah, that's right. You went half just slightly [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6637.12s)]
*  Unbelievable, I'm Jewish in case people don't know this Jewish and very proud of it. And if you have a problem with that you can leave [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6643.5199999999995s)]
*  I'll do a last question. That's based on the criticism that you guys have gotten from a lot of Democrats [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6653.0s)]
*  This is criticism we get whenever we talk about it which is why is this still relevant now and [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6659.32s)]
*  Leave the guy alone [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6666.28s)]
*  You know leave leave the past in the past and let's focus on the current president who at least half the country [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6668.28s)]
*  Would argue is is more unfit than Joe Biden albeit for different reasons [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6675.12s)]
*  What do you guys say to that? [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6681.24s)]
*  I mean I would say this is part of the reason why the Democratic Party is in the situation is in I mean anytime [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6682.68s)]
*  There was any coverage about age when I brought it up or Jake brought it up [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6689.120000000001s)]
*  it was what about Trump and [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6693.4400000000005s)]
*  You know reporting is about holding up a mirror and the Democratic Party can either look in the mirror and recognize [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6696.040000000001s)]
*  This is part of the reason they lost that [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6701.8s)]
*  You know while they rightly mock Republicans for [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6704.84s)]
*  Trashing Trump in private and then going out there and saying you know [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6708.68s)]
*  They were doing the exact same thing when they were trotting out being like Biden is sharp [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6712.52s)]
*  He's running circles around us. He is so engaged [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6717.240000000001s)]
*  You wouldn't even believe it all you had to do is be in the meetings and it just wasn't true [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6720.040000000001s)]
*  So I guess you know [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6724.84s)]
*  Democrats if they if they want I have no idea if the Democratic Party if the voters are actually going to engage [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6726.6s)]
*  With the content of this book, but reporting is just about trying to hold up a mirror [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6732.68s)]
*  So I have two points on this first of all it just happened [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6738.16s)]
*  The debate wasn't even a year ago. It was June of last year. I mean it just happened when [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6742.72s)]
*  We're supposed to write books [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6749.76s)]
*  Yeah, by the way also I learned here tonight that you did the book proposal on November 6th you are sick [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6752.8s)]
*  You're sick. You're sick. You're sick. You're sick. You're sick [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6758.84s)]
*  You're sick. You're sick. You're sick [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6761.84s)]
*  I have problems the other the other point I would make it's true. I'm very driven [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6763.84s)]
*  That's my this okay quick Obama aside [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6771.2s)]
*  No, this is a good Obama story. This is one of my favorite Obama stories [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6774.2s)]
*  It's one of the first debates in 2020 in 2007 2007 or 2008 and it's like Hillary [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6777.96s)]
*  She's a good Obama story. She's a good Obama story. She's a good Obama story [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6784.84s)]
*  In 2007 or 2008 and it's like Hillary [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6789.16s)]
*  John Edwards and Obama and they're asked what is your biggest fault and Obama goes first and he's like well [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6794.24s)]
*  I'm really messy of a messy desk [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6800.08s)]
*  it's a real problem and then John Edwards is like I [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6802.48s)]
*  Care so much about people voices voices. I really really it's a problem [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6807.719999999999s)]
*  I really care about the American and then Hillary's like I work so hard I [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6814.56s)]
*  Work so hard and American people and they and then Obama's like wait a second [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6820.88s)]
*  I didn't think we were giving answers like that. I thought I thought we were supposed to really answer the question [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6825.52s)]
*  The best Obama moment ever and then he would he would tell that story on the stump for like the next couple weeks [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6831.240000000001s)]
*  It was like a great laugh line [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6836.64s)]
*  The other thing I would say in response to the why aren't you covering Trump? [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6838.160000000001s)]
*  I cover Trump every day for two hours still even on the road [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6841.64s)]
*  But beyond that so I don't know how many of you have gone to New York to see good night and good luck [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6845.68s)]
*  If you haven't yet, it's great [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6851.200000000001s)]
*  If you haven't yet CNN is actually going to show it on Saturday night on CNN and you should see it because it's really good [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6853.08s)]
*  It's a they're they're doing a live of [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6858.4400000000005s)]
*  Cats cast a broadcast of the play but at the very end of the whole play takes place in 1954 [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6861.160000000001s)]
*  It's Murrow and McCarthy and all that at the very end [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6867.8s)]
*  There is like the one thing that's not said in 1954 is this is montage of video clips of the television news [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6872.12s)]
*  And you know, there's like the moon landing and JFK getting assassinated and all these things and at the end of this montage [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6879.320000000001s)]
*  It's maybe I don't even know five ten minutes something like that [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6885.92s)]
*  It goes like that [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6888.4800000000005s)]
*  but at the end of it there you see [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6889.360000000001s)]
*  Republicans lying about the 2020 election on cable and then you see Democrats lying about [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6891.84s)]
*  Biden's acuity on cable [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6897.96s)]
*  And I asked Clooney for an interview [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6900.12s)]
*  I did when we did the New Yorker excerpt of the of the book [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6902.88s)]
*  Just to give like a little special something for the for the New Yorker. I asked Clooney to [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6907.68s)]
*  Weigh in why did you put that in obviously George Clooney? [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6914.400000000001s)]
*  played a role in all of this when he wrote his op-ed calling for Biden to drop out and he said it's important that we that we [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6918.0s)]
*  You know call that out to the people vouching for Biden because we have to speak truth to power no matter who's in power [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6924.52s)]
*  And I said, well, what do you tell people who say, you know, what about Trump? He said, how do you think we got Trump? [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6930.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6940.040000000001s)]
*  Mean, yeah, I mean look from a perspective of you know, a couple Democrats who want Democrats to win again [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6941.96s)]
*  Like you can't you cannot tell people that what they are seeing and what they are hearing isn't true [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6948.360000000001s)]
*  And it wasn't just over the last four years. It was a Biden thing with the age [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6954.18s)]
*  look it was also about inflation and costs and and [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6959.160000000001s)]
*  You know, someone would say well gas prices are high and then suppose [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6962.76s)]
*  Oh, well that you just took that picture in front of a gas station that where the prices are always high [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6965.56s)]
*  It's like I get that that can be frustrating. Like I've been on the other side of it [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6970.1s)]
*  I've you know worked in the White House and [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6973.780000000001s)]
*  Yelled at reporters, maybe you guys [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6976.139999999999s)]
*  But like at some point [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6979.179999999999s)]
*  The voters get to decide and you have to listen to the voters because if you do not listen to the voters [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6981.219999999999s)]
*  You cannot get the votes you need to take power [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6987.259999999999s)]
*  It seems very simple, but it is something that we we have at least some parts of the party have forgotten [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6989.9s)]
*  I mean, I think it's a lesson of this book that you know [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6994.679999999999s)]
*  there's an old expression that Washington is often the last to get the news and [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=6997.74s)]
*  the Democratic Party and [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7002.099999999999s)]
*  And very much including and especially this the Biden White House [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7004.26s)]
*  did not want to [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7009.26s)]
*  respect or listen to their own voters and [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7011.42s)]
*  I think you could also argue that the Democratic Party has not listened or [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7014.42s)]
*  totally respected their voters in the last three presidential primaries and [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7020.740000000001s)]
*  Some of the argument has been well [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7024.38s)]
*  We don't want a divisive primary because Hillary was hurt by Bernie you guys know the most the probably the most divisive [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7025.9400000000005s)]
*  Democratic primary in recent American history was your guys's and Obama entered with 60 [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7031.54s)]
*  Set like Democratic Senate seats that like divisive primaries allow for debate and for voters to decide who the strongest candidate is [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7037.34s)]
*  They're not inherently bad [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7044.56s)]
*  I would argue that the last time the Democratic Party when on the presidential level listened to its voters was 2008 [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7045.62s)]
*  2020 [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7052.86s)]
*  And and what about 2020? I don't know in 2020 [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7053.9800000000005s)]
*  the party [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7058.9800000000005s)]
*  So just to remind folks [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7060.62s)]
*  Buttigieg won, Iowa Bernie won, New Hampshire [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7063.0599999999995s)]
*  Bernie won, Nevada Joe Biden won, South Carolina, and then there was this uprising of [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7066.14s)]
*  Obama and the party [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7072.22s)]
*  influencers to get everybody out of the race [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7074.22s)]
*  Except for Joe Biden so that they could beat Bernie because they were terrified [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7078.9s)]
*  Bernie was going to be the nominee and they did that they I'm not here to advocate for Bernie Sanders, but [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7083.18s)]
*  And obviously it worked out the way the Democrats wanted it to work out [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7089.740000000001s)]
*  But the last time Democrats actually in 2012 doesn't really count because it's an incumbent [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7092.9800000000005s)]
*  But the last time there was an open process and the Democrats said okay go [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7097.820000000001s)]
*  you know Obama Hillary Edwards whoever Biden Chris Dodd whatever like and [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7102.700000000001s)]
*  The voters did a pretty good job. Well the voters also I mean look yes [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7108.46s)]
*  But voters chose Joe Biden in that primary in 2020 [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7112.1s)]
*  I think I think there's some truth in what you're saying [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7115.02s)]
*  But I will also say there was another moment when I feel like what we saw was a kind of [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7117.08s)]
*  The voters having their say in a way and and a kind of moment where you saw how the Democratic Party is very different [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7122.12s)]
*  Than the Republican Party which is after that debate [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7128.08s)]
*  Because I do think there's a part of this story that is I think even though it did not end the way we had all hoped [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7130.28s)]
*  Is inspiring which is in the wake of that debate [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7135.88s)]
*  What you saw is people willing to tell the truth about what they saw and the importance of making a change you have [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7138.84s)]
*  Leading Democrats going to Joe Biden [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7144.22s)]
*  Asking him to step aside you have these incredible moments which you report on in the book of Congress members of Congress [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7146.58s)]
*  Trying to speak directly to Joe Biden about this not liking what they're hearing not accepting [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7151.9800000000005s)]
*  No for an answer you have people on the outside talking about this you have people you have a real and genuine [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7156.02s)]
*  moment of a group of people coming together and saying hey for the good of the country this guy has to step aside because Trump is [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7161.740000000001s)]
*  An existential threat and it may not have ended in Kamala being president, but it did I think speak to [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7167.320000000001s)]
*  To me like the values you're trying to say we didn't evince before [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7172.860000000001s)]
*  When Joe but when people were getting behind Joe Biden we believe out there. I would say they get half credit [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7178.02s)]
*  I mean, I think your point is well taken that if if Donald Trump had had [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7184.14s)]
*  If Donald Trump had had like showed serious signs of decline or whatever that and had that similar debate [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7188.34s)]
*  I I grant the point that a lot of Republican lawmakers would not have the courage to finally speak out [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7194.320000000001s)]
*  Tried to steal an election and you know as stage an insurrection in the capital [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7200.78s)]
*  They're like, yeah, 24 hours of courage in the wake of it [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7204.7s)]
*  All I'm saying is I think what I take away from it is there was a we were there was no one in charge [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7207.3s)]
*  There was no one making the decision [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7211.86s)]
*  We were kind of sleepwalking towards disaster and then after that debate we woke up and the question is now [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7212.86s)]
*  How do we make sure we stay awake and are honest about challenges the Democratic Party granted? [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7218.26s)]
*  I was just gonna add though [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7224.26s)]
*  I don't think you get like points for courage when you only do it because you now believe you might lose [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7226.0199999999995s)]
*  Oh, oh Alex. I thought we were gonna lose for months [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7232.259999999999s)]
*  Then we just I just knew it after the debate I [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7237.58s)]
*  Think that Alex and I have a slightly less [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7240.82s)]
*  Positive review of Democrats and I'll just tell you why like can anybody here guess how many Democratic governors? [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7244.139999999999s)]
*  Called for Biden to drop out of the race after the debate [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7251.259999999999s)]
*  One governor governor Haley, Massachusetts, how many Democratic senators [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7256.0199999999995s)]
*  One [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7262.179999999999s)]
*  Governor senator Welsh of Vermont. I mean it wasn't an outpouring of courage [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7263.299999999999s)]
*  It was a lot of behind-the-scenes maneuvering because people didn't want to come across as jerks [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7268.5199999999995s)]
*  There were the house members were braver. Yeah [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7274.62s)]
*  And and they're you know, they're the lowest on the totem pole and we thought we were going insane [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7277.7s)]
*  We're like what what is happening? What did we miss something? [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7282.259999999999s)]
*  Well, the thing that was what was so surprised right because we're talking about it and we're getting a lot of blowback online [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7285.14s)]
*  But privately hearing from a lot of people being like thank you guys for saying [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7290.18s)]
*  I'm glad you guys are out there saying this we need people out there saying this [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7293.900000000001s)]
*  and then the other thing I would say is that [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7297.14s)]
*  The argument is about whether or not he should be the nominee [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7299.620000000001s)]
*  But the truth of the matter is our reporting suggests that he he could not be an effective president 24-7 [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7302.6s)]
*  Which is what the job requires and there's only one member of there's only one elected Democratic official that I know of and that's Congresswoman [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7309.7s)]
*  Marie glues and camp Perez in Washington State who actually said he shouldn't be the nominee and to be honest [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7317.58s)]
*  He probably shouldn't be president either [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7322.72s)]
*  And although you said to in the book this also shocked me that out of the 200 plus people you guys talked to there were [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7324.099999999999s)]
*  very few [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7331.0599999999995s)]
*  Who actually thought he could serve out a second term which that means that that would include? [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7332.5s)]
*  Your White House staff campaign staff who told you they did not think almost sir [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7337.46s)]
*  yeah, they were like the plan was to get to November 5th and [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7341.42s)]
*  Figure it out later. I mean we had one long time Biden aid that I [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7344.82s)]
*  mean that like that that was I mean if if [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7349.7s)]
*  You know the right wing sometimes refers to you know the Trump derangement syndrome [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7353.299999999999s)]
*  Mocking Democrats that I think actually very sincerely are opposed to Trump's agenda, but if you continue the metaphor the biggest [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7358.599999999999s)]
*  Symptom is publicly telling everyone that Joe Biden could be president for another four years and [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7366.14s)]
*  It just what and the people knew that he could not do the job [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7371.9800000000005s)]
*  He was running for but there there was such fear of Trump that they said let's go and you know members [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7375.6s)]
*  long-time Biden people basically felt that it eventually if he had won there would have eventually been [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7382.14s)]
*  Some sort of constitutional crisis because clearly the people around him were not willing to like cede power [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7388.34s)]
*  Tell them so we always say that we almost all the interviews of the more than 200 we did for the book were after [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7394.46s)]
*  The election we have to put in this stupid almost because of this one interview that Alex did with somebody tell them what they told [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7400.58s)]
*  You I mean they were honest as long time Biden aid [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7405.34s)]
*  And they said all he had to do was win and then only had to show proof of life every once in a while [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7407.9800000000005s)]
*  What let's say I feel like we've I want to end on a light moment from the book [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7414.06s)]
*  Let's let which is it's a small another clip you know this is a small moment [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7419.94s)]
*  But it didn't even play my Obama which is really good. Yeah, that is true [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7425.14s)]
*  his Obama is good not as I've listened but because he hello Joe all the time save it for the sequel but the [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7428.58s)]

*  but uh [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7442.38s)]
*  So the debate happens and how does it come to be that Doug Emhoff is watching the debate with Rob Reiner and [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7443.42s)]
*  Then the debate ends Rob Reiner furious starts berating Doug Emhoff poor Doug [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7450.78s)]
*  Well, I think it was more that he was that Rob Reiner [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7456.18s)]
*  Who is a very excitable fella? [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7459.9400000000005s)]
*  Was just screaming and he seemed to be yelling at Emhoff and he said we're gonna lose our fucking democracy [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adRJgdpFtS8&t=7463.9400000000005s)]
