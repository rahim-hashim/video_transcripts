Video Description: Tim Walz and JD Vance prepare for the last big moment of the campaign: Tuesday's vice presidential debate. Jon, Lovett, and Tommy handicap Walz's strengths and weaknesses and offer their advice on lines of attack. Plus, just a day after threatening a "really violent" police purge, Donald Trump travels to hurricane-ravaged Georgia to lie about Joe Biden and Kamala Harris deliberately holding up aid. Then, legendary strategist James Carville stops by to talk about where the race stands and how Harris can pull out a win.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

*  Tim Walz and JD Vance head into Tuesday night's VP debate with the race stuck in a dead heat and the rage in Cajun himself James [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=9.36s)]
*  Carville stops by to talk about the state of the race and the new documentary about his career in Democratic politics [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  But first as you all know the death toll from Hurricane Helene is now north of a hundred [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=22.72s)]
*  There is [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=28.619999999999997s)]
*  unbelievable devastation across the southeastern states [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=30.099999999999998s)]
*  And as we're recording this thousands of people in Western North Carolina are still stranded without power water or fuel [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=33.5s)]
*  the normal response to a disaster like this from [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=40.74s)]
*  Political leaders would be to pledge support send relief figure out how to immediately help people in need [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=43.94s)]
*  That's what President Biden is doing. That's what Vice President Harris did when she spoke at FEMA headquarters in DC on Monday [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=49.86s)]
*  Here's a clip to everyone who has been impacted by this storm and to all of those of you who are rightly feeling [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=56.26s)]
*  overwhelmed by the destruction and the loss [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=64.18s)]
*  our nation is with you and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=67.5s)]
*  President Biden and I and all of the folks behind me are with you [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=70.9s)]
*  We will continue to do everything we can to help you recover and to help you rebuild [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=75.02000000000001s)]
*  No matter how long it takes [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=81.14s)]
*  Over the past 24 hours I have spoken with Governor Kemp of Georgia Governor Cooper of North Carolina and many local officials I [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=83.78s)]
*  Have shared with them that we will do everything in our power to help communities [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=92.46000000000001s)]
*  respond and recover and I've shared with them that I plan to be on the ground as soon as possible [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=97.86s)]
*  But as soon as possible without disrupting any emergency response operations [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=103.86s)]
*  Because that must be the highest priority in the first order of business [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=108.94s)]
*  So the Republican nominee for president taking a slightly different path [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=113.5s)]
*  Even though local officials as the VP just mentioned have asked both campaigns to temporarily stay away from the affected areas [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=118.46000000000001s)]
*  So that resources aren't diverted from the emergency response [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=125.9s)]
*  Trump went to Georgia on Monday to quote deliver supplies [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=129.26s)]
*  After he falsely accused the Biden administration and Democratic Governor Roy Cooper of quote going out of their way to not help people in [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=132.82s)]
*  Republican areas Trump also said that Georgia Governor Brian Kemp has quote been having a very hard time getting the president on the phone [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=140.38s)]
*  Which was a little weird when governor Kemp then said he just spoke to the president on Sunday [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=149.54s)]
*  How shocked were you guys that Trump decided to play politics here and by play politics I mean tell the most easily refuted lies [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=156.82s)]
*  Not surprised at all. I did it is like I I was trying to like, you know [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=164.94s)]
*  Trump like moves your baseline because he's so fucking crazy and I was like trying to remember like well things have happened before and I [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=169.94s)]
*  Remember when 2004 I was an intern for the Kerry campaign [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=175.02s)]
*  There happened to have been four hurricanes that hit Florida in that cycle and I went back and looked at what happened [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=178.22s)]
*  After that and there were headlines about how there would be politics [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=184.22s)]
*  But what the Kerry campaign and the Bush campaign were very clear like we're not playing politics with this [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=187.18s)]
*  They both talked about how privately people were worried about what the implications would be [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=191.07999999999998s)]
*  Bush got to go be as the AP referred to him comforter-in-chief [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=194.94s)]
*  John Kerry waited a few days because he was listening to local authorities and then he went down there to [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=198.46s)]
*  Talk to people and meet with people there was a Bill Nelson was a Democratic [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=204.02s)]
*  Senator from Florida toward with him saying we wanted John Kerry to come because if he becomes president [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=208.58s)]
*  We want to understand the damage here Kerry went to great lengths to say this is a bipartisan moment [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=213.34s)]
*  And so what you have is two politicians trying to make the most of it politically if we're being honest, right? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=217.58s)]
*  Let's be okay to be cynical about like some aspect of this but understanding what they were supposed to do to like at least [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=222.82s)]
*  Model being somewhat apolitical and like Trump just obliterates that instantly both by going despite even the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=228.82s)]
*  Nonpartisan mayor of that town saying we would have liked for him to come on another fucking day [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=235.82s)]
*  Give us a few days to figure out what we can what we have to do to dig out of this [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=239.98s)]
*  But also then make up conspiracies show up in a make America great again had have a little wall of bricks [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=243.22s)]
*  Build a build around him. I was to make it [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=248.82s)]
*  It's a it's like a you know a disaster photo app and it's it's gross [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=251.1s)]
*  Remember there also was an expectation back in the day that candidates would even pull down attack ads or political ads generally [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=256.3s)]
*  I mean there used to be so much like care and thought put into these things and now he just makes stuff up [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=261.58s)]
*  Trump also said that no one expected a hurricane like this because we're at it's after hurricane seasons [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=265.46s)]
*  Absolutely, not or dead square in the middle of hurricane season. Everyone expected this to happen. It is only Trump to I mean we remember is [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=271.26s)]
*  Just in 2012 right after Hurricane Sandy and Barack Obama goes and gives Chris Christie a big hug [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=279.1s)]
*  Which you know hurt Chris Christie's career in the Trump era [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=285.2s)]
*  But like we're stuck he's ever gotten like governor Kemp Republican governor Democratic governor Roy Cooper Joe Biden Kamala Harris [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=289.02s)]
*  They're all working together. They're all helping each other out. Then there's Donald Trump out there [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=296.02s)]
*  just try it like just lying and here's the problem too, because the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=299.5s)]
*  You know, there is the hurricane has disrupted power and Wi-Fi service [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=302.78000000000003s)]
*  Out in Western North Carolina, there's sort of like a lack of local news coverage [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=307.82s)]
*  There's garbage Twitter accounts on the right and even some on the far left. They're just spreading absolute [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=311.62s)]
*  lies [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=318.58s)]
*  craziness about like Biden not helping meanwhile, there's like hundreds and hundreds of [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=319.82s)]
*  FEMA [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=326.1s)]
*  Responders they're helping out the federal government's doing like the federal government signed an emergency declaration [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=328.14s)]
*  That like before the hurricane even hit just so that resources would be freed up. I mean, it's just right crazy [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=334.1s)]
*  There's some sequencing to this too [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=339.94s)]
*  and that's why in these times of crisis the the governors and the president have to work together because the governor makes a [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=341.5s)]
*  Request and then the White House has to grant it and that unlocks certain authorities and in this case [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=348.06s)]
*  I think Biden could have gotten either an emergency declaration request or a major disaster declaration request [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=352.56s)]
*  Which unlocks even more federal government resources and he did the major disaster declaration [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=358.5s)]
*  So Biden literally is doing everything he can in real time. Yeah, it's just it's completely made up [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=363.54s)]
*  It's not this even for Trump these things used to be based on like a hint of oh did he was he a little slow on? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=369.18s)]
*  Something to do something. There's just nothing nothing. Absolutely nothing [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=375.62s)]
*  yeah, and there is sort of like a bottom-up top-down thing because like that there's a [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=378.66s)]
*  Conspiratorial mindset that has taken hold on the right that is spread on social media and I noticed it [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=383.22s)]
*  Like as the storm was unfolding there were already people on social media saying where's the federal government? They haven't responded [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=388.86s)]
*  They're abandoning this region and you realize like okay. So that is the mindset that Trump is sort of I think like [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=395.06s)]
*  part of what led him to be successful and also what he feeds and then he's just [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=401.5s)]
*  Ready to come right on top and to like sort of feed that worst impulse [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=405.38s)]
*  What do you guys think of Harris's response so far and what she should do obviously it happens a lot in these situations that [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=409.47999999999996s)]
*  The local officials tell politicians not to come right away [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=415.76s)]
*  But then the politicians don't want to be accused of looking like they don't care. So they want to go [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=419.29999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think she's doing everything she should be doing. She got briefed by the head of FEMA. She's talked to Roy Cooper [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=423.44s)]
*  She went to FEMA today. I think in terms of the visit [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=427.79999999999995s)]
*  I would just be in constant contact with Roy Cooper's office in North Carolina and figure out the earliest possible time that doesn't impede [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=431.26s)]
*  Relief operations and you don't have to go to downtown Asheville [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=437.74s)]
*  You could go to you know [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=440.94s)]
*  County over where FEMA is staging like relief operations and go there and talk to people [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=442.85999999999996s)]
*  Hear directly from folks affected, but I think like showing up is really really important [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=448.02s)]
*  I think the more complicated political question is gonna be do you go with Joe Biden? Do you go separately? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=452.82s)]
*  Navigating that is gonna be is gonna be hard. But I also think you know, if I were the Harris campaign, I would consider [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=458.62s)]
*  Finding a bunch of really good local relief organizations and then sending an email to my list [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=465.47999999999996s)]
*  Fundraising for them and then saying to my field staff in Western North Carolina like art for the next two weeks [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=469.71999999999997s)]
*  We're not doing campaign stuff [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=474.2s)]
*  You're putting on a Harris Wall shirt and you're going doing whatever relief is happening sandbagging cleaning up [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=475.44s)]
*  Helping people get food like whatever it takes just be in the community [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=481.52s)]
*  Representing the Harris Walls campaign but do what it takes to help those people. I think that would be pretty impactful [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=485.36s)]
*  Yeah, I think you go I thought about that too Tommy I think she goes with Biden like I think she should go by it's like [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=491.0s)]
*  He said he was gonna go Thursday Friday their president vice president [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=496.88s)]
*  You want I mean like two visits if you don't go with him too, so it's doubly disruptive you right exactly, right? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=500.28s)]
*  Right, right. Sorry. Yeah. No, that's why and like, you know, they're she's not afraid of being so like they've done events together [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=506.08s)]
*  Since she's been the the nominee and it's like it's not a political rally. So I think she's like you said your name is Joe [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=512.12s)]
*  Right, yeah [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=517.92s)]
*  I wonder if [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=523.04s)]
*  If Trump keeps this up or even now that he's already attacked them for it [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=525.6s)]
*  Like do you at some point take a shot at Trump? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=530.3s)]
*  For doing this not in a way that's like now I'm gonna go after you but just sort of like look [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=534.52s)]
*  we're trying to work with Republicans Democrats, we're trying to focus on this and [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=540.4s)]
*  You know a disaster just hit people in red areas and blue areas and we're trying to help everyone [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=545.52s)]
*  That we that we can and we don't need Donald Trump exploiting people suffering [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=550.3199999999999s)]
*  And and trying to divide us so we can pick up a few votes [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=556.36s)]
*  Like people are tired of this shit kind of thing and I don't know if maybe walls does that tomorrow night in the debate [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=559.9399999999999s)]
*  I don't know if Harris does it like next week sometime [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=566.38s)]
*  I mean, you don't want to do it right now [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=569.88s)]
*  But like I kind of think you've got to call out his game at some point if you want it to get [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=571.36s)]
*  Traction and to like really stop it from happening or at least stop it from affecting. Yeah the election [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=576.12s)]
*  I think that's right. I think like I like sort of stepping back like just she should just be modeling responsibility [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=582.14s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know you're not saying otherwise [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=588.5600000000001s)]
*  But but like she should be modeling responsibility and what that looks like is not like Trump is [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=590.12s)]
*  Wants to seem responsible and look responsible. So he's being irresponsible [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=594.84s)]
*  He cares what it looks like not what it is and she should just do the opposite [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=598.6s)]
*  And I think if she's asked a question about why she waited or something like that [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=601.62s)]
*  I think it's like I don't know if you like go out of your way to do it [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=605.22s)]
*  But you respond and say there are people that want to use this to exploit a tragedy for political gain [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=607.5600000000001s)]
*  There are people that are thinking only about how it affects themselves. I'm not gonna do that. We're here. We're all Democrats Republicans [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=612.76s)]
*  We're all here together trying to rebuild and like I think she can take a shot at him that way [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=617.8000000000001s)]
*  I think great just as you know, just telling the truth [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=621.1s)]
*  Yeah [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=623.6s)]
*  It's an it gets annoying for sure for President Biden people in the government too because it's like you model responsibility and then because no [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=624.32s)]
*  One ever pays attention to anything who's not affected by something they like your your your model of responsibility [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=631.4000000000001s)]
*  Just like doesn't just goes unnoticed. Yeah, this is why I think sometimes too. It's like, you know, it's it's [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=638.12s)]
*  About to be October when the final sprint for this election [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=643.9200000000001s)]
*  So it's not the time to step back and wonder how did we get here? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=646.48s)]
*  But like, you know [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=649.1400000000001s)]
*  We lay at the feet of Joe Biden Kamala Harris of any responsible elected figure all the sins of the media environment and [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=650.12s)]
*  the crassness of our opponents and it's like no like yeah [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=657.2s)]
*  sometimes now because of how social media works a [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=660.72s)]
*  politician doing everything Joe Biden responding exactly the way he should still doesn't stop a Republican leader from North Carolina or from [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=663.68s)]
*  One of these states saying where's Joe Biden? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=670.68s)]
*  He didn't issue the response when he did exactly as he should have done in response to requests from the government [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=672.48s)]
*  Or do you hear that reporter? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=677.92s)]
*  Shout it [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=679.92s)]
*  He got a shouted question at the White House after he talked about everything the federal government was doing the reporters like why weren't you here? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=680.4399999999999s)]
*  Commanding the response over the weekend Biden was like I was on the phone for two hours yesterday like commanding the response [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=687.08s)]
*  Right, so you want something to look like you you want the wall of bricks assembled by an advanced [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=693.74s)]
*  That's right. You want the throwing of the chicken nuggets like you want that? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=698.88s)]
*  That's what you think you want something that looks like that. You want better TV what you want the performance of empathy [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=702.0s)]
*  We're gonna bomb the hurricane. What are we talking about? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=707.68s)]
*  You pre position a bunch of assets and you make sure FEMA is on top of it like you need a competent team [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=710.4399999999999s)]
*  that's what Joe Biden has put in place like people also make the comparison to [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=715.6s)]
*  Bush and Hurricane Katrina and the like Air Force one photo op over New Orleans, which was obviously very bad [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=719.72s)]
*  But also came on the heels of a 29 day vacation in Crawford, Texas [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=725.4399999999999s)]
*  That's part of why it was so bad [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=729.84s)]
*  And then on top of that like the FEMA administrator was a clown who would run the Arabian Horse Federation [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=731.48s)]
*  Remember Brownie and the state local response was terrible [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=736.4s)]
*  and so he was blamed for like the the the most important thing that Joe Biden Kamala Harris can do is make sure that [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=739.72s)]
*  People get the help they need. Yes, that is also the most important political move to yeah, it's the right thing [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=745.36s)]
*  That's what I said. Yeah, but it's also very politics [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=751.36s)]
*  We should note that if Trump had his way a federal government would be shut down right now [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=754.34s)]
*  Very good point. He did not succeed in his attempt to get Republicans to shut down the government that Biden signed the [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=758.64s)]
*  Continuing resolution so it'll be funded through the election [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=765.54s)]
*  And as a lot of Democrats have been pointing out project 2025 calls for breaking up and privatizing big parts of the National Weather Service [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=768.46s)]
*  eliminating small business disaster loans and raising the threshold for disaster declarations [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=777.14s)]
*  Is there a policy case for Harris to make here or that's is that too much? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=784.42s)]
*  I don't think you do it right now [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=788.38s)]
*  But I do think as we talk about this in the next couple of weeks, I think [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=790.26s)]
*  Referring to all of that but also stepping back and saying people, you know [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=794.9399999999999s)]
*  Local officials are saying they're not only just gonna have to rebuild [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=797.78s)]
*  They're gonna have to rebuild with an eye towards being ready for future storms that are even more severe because climate change [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=800.18s)]
*  Is having such an obvious impact and reminding people of the stakes around climate and the fact that like [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=806.26s)]
*  The investments that like the the money to rebuild the money to invest in infrastructure like Donald Trump promised he would do it [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=812.7s)]
*  It was Joe Biden that delivered on these things whether it's through the infrastructure bill or through the Inflation Reduction Act [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=819.24s)]
*  I feel like those are all points to me [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=823.52s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think there's two points I'd make one [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=825.52s)]
*  Is that like events like this or why you need a federal government is the only entity in the world that has enough resources to like surge [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=828.36s)]
*  Assets to a place like Asheville in the near term and then rebuild in the long term [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=836.28s)]
*  And then I also think it's appropriate to talk about how project 2025 wants to take the National Oceanic Atmospheric [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=839.36s)]
*  Administration or NOAA and the National Weather Service and fundamentally change them [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=846.1999999999999s)]
*  they want to privatize the Weather Service and commercialize it and really like the goal here is you have a bunch of [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=850.4399999999999s)]
*  anti climate change [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=858.16s)]
*  Ideologues who don't want any government data going towards making the case that climate change is real and man-made and they want to distort it [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=860.36s)]
*  So you're gonna with some you're gonna end up with some natural gas lobbyists in charge of like the National Weather Service [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=868.1s)]
*  Selling telling people that is probably worthwhile. They don't like our satellites pointed down. They're like [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=875.24s)]
*  Mission creep pointed up [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=880.92s)]
*  Miami's underwater today everyone, but wow just must have been a freak storm and great day for cut great day for kayak rentals [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=883.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=890.6s)]
*  Also, so it's funny because you have project 2025 which is like the brainchild of these like extreme right-wing [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=892.0799999999999s)]
*  Activists who just don't want government at all, right? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=899.72s)]
*  Like they don't think the federal government has a role then you have Donald Trump and his view on these things is [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=902.52s)]
*  you use the federal government to help the people that you like and who like you Republicans and you screw over the people who [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=907.48s)]
*  Don't support you. And so everything is politicized. The government is politicized government power is politicized, right? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=915.12s)]
*  And so sure enough like Trump who's like yelling right now about how you know, Joe Biden and is calling [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=920.84s)]
*  governor camp or whatever after Hurricane Matthew in [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=927.76s)]
*  2017 hit North Carolina the Trump administration denied 99% of the aid requested by [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=931.6800000000001s)]
*  Democratic governor Roy Cooper for North Carolina [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=938.64s)]
*  So that's the last time one of the last times North Carolina had a big big disaster hit Trump said no [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=940.96s)]
*  Thanks. I'll set but we've all like I have amnesia but like there was this sort of like [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=946.72s)]
*  sickening reality after the after the the pandemic began where [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=951.8000000000001s)]
*  Gavin Newsom and and Andrew Cuomo had to like praise the dear leader because they wanted to make sure they were [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=955.48s)]
*  Getting the resources they needed in the middle of an emergency and they knew that the actual stakes actual empathy for what people are going [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=960.84s)]
*  Through was immaterial. Yeah, that is something that's something to look forward to that with the second Trump term [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=966.24s)]
*  Disaster hits and you better hope that you're you live in a red red state. Yeah, what's no atheist in a foxhole? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=971.84s)]
*  No libertarians in a disaster relief zone. That's [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=977.9200000000001s)]
*  No Heritage Foundation staff we'll keep [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=982.44s)]
*  Before we move on to other subjects [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=986.36s)]
*  We wanted to let you know that if you want to help folks affected by the storm and the flooding [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=987.84s)]
*  You can go to vote save America comm slash Helene [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=991.6s)]
*  Your donation will go to some organizations that are helping on the ground right now and they're gonna keep updating those orgs as needed [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=995.2800000000001s)]
*  Okay over the weekend while the storm was hitting the southeast Trump was campaigning in the Midwest where he gave a speech that even he [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1003.72s)]
*  Described is dark boy. Was it yo Biden became mentally impaired? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1009.6s)]
*  Kamala [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1014.8000000000001s)]
*  Was born that way [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1016.0s)]
*  You got to do what you got to do you got to get these people back where they came from you have no choice [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1021.68s)]
*  You're gonna lose your culture. You're gonna lose your country if we win and when we win [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1027.48s)]
*  We're gonna prosecute people that cheat on this election [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1032.88s)]
*  And if we can we'll go back to the last one too, oh there's a fly oh I wonder where the fly came from [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1038.52s)]
*  See two years ago [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1046.52s)]
*  I wouldn't have had a fly up here shelves. They literally the people walk in they just take everything they want they walk out of the store [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1049.16s)]
*  What the hell is going on? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1056.12s)]
*  But they have to be taught now if you had one really violent day one rough hour and I mean real rough [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1057.88s)]
*  The word will get out and it will end [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1065.56s)]
*  immediately and immediately [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1068.84s)]
*  So love it you said that you know what he was suggesting with the [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1071.72s)]
*  One violent day thing did he think the purge was a documentary? So so here's what I thought what he was in his adult brain [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1077.12s)]
*  He's sort of he's pulling back old things [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1083.76s)]
*  He used to say but not as clearly as he was able to say before and what I what I think he's talking about [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1086.1599999999999s)]
*  Is something that you would hear like from from a from a New Yorker like this would be something like [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1091.0s)]
*  You know why there's no homeless people in front of Tiffany's or you know [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1095.28s)]
*  Restaurants used to do back in the day if somebody tried to steal from them [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1098.2s)]
*  They would they would have somebody go out and beat the ever-loving shit out of them [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1101.08s)]
*  And then that person would tell all their friends you have to worry about it anymore. That's why there's no homeless people over here [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1104.48s)]
*  That's what you used to have the mob used to have dirty cut [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1108.92s)]
*  Whatever it is and you would dispatch these people and they would rough somebody up and they would get the word out [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1110.92s)]
*  That's that's that is what he is talking about there. That's sort of in his mind [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1115.6399999999999s)]
*  He's referencing that kind of way people would talk about [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1118.8799999999999s)]
*  Crime that like you could fix this by beating somebody up and then they'll tell all their friends [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1123.6s)]
*  it you know the Times wrote this up and [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1128.2s)]
*  Just sort of stunning to read it in a straight news story [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1131.8799999999999s)]
*  But it said Trump has in the past urged law enforcement to be rougher when making arrests and called for the summary execution of shoplifters [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1134.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, this like yeah, that is what that is true [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1143.2s)]
*  That is what he has said before and then the roughing up suspects thing was in a speech to police in 2017 [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1146.56s)]
*  He also wants universal stop-and-frisk. He wants to deny [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1152.96s)]
*  Funding for local police departments that do not implement universal stop-and-frisk [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1157.8s)]
*  I think he genuinely believes that extreme government violence is a way to prevent crime because he also on the international stage [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1161.7199999999998s)]
*  He talks about Rodrigo Duterte all the time the former president of the Philippines [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1167.76s)]
*  Who's quote-unquote war on drugs was basically just massacring people innocent guilty didn't matter thousands of them [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1171.04s)]
*  and he would praise him all the time publicly privately and phone calls and [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1177.56s)]
*  This is just what he thinks is what you should do [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1181.9199999999998s)]
*  He has proposed the death penalty for drug dealers like just he wants to execute drug dealers, which is what deterred [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1184.08s)]
*  Now do you think of any of what we just heard from Trump in that clip is is moving any voters [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1191.52s)]
*  Should Harris respond to any of it? What do you guys think? I? [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1197.24s)]
*  Don't think so [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1200.48s)]
*  I mean the most egregious thing in there was Trump referring to Kamala Harris is mentally disabled [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1201.48s)]
*  Which is like disgusting and offensive, but I don't think you want to make it about you [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1206.24s)]
*  So I don't know I didn't hear anything there that I would jump on [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1210.6s)]
*  Yeah, I just like I think you got to just put it in the bucket of like Trump's out here spewing all this nonsense and all [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1214.08s)]
*  This craziness and all this division and all this meanness and all this cruelty [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1219.08s)]
*  Remember why he's doing all this he's doing this because he's distracting from the fact that he has an incredibly unpopular agenda [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1223.1999999999998s)]
*  He wants to cut taxes corporations [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1228.3999999999999s)]
*  He wants to do a mass deportation that would disrupt our economy and cause a second Great Depression [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1230.6799999999998s)]
*  He wants to overturn [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1237.06s)]
*  Abortion rights even in in in blue states like he's this is this is what Donald Trump is promising [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1238.9199999999998s)]
*  So don't let the noise and don't let the bullshit and don't let the the the the the crazy ramblings fool you [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1243.9199999999998s)]
*  He's very he's very dangerous, and these are the things he's gonna do I would like to [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1249.1s)]
*  Watch a group of undecided voters or persuadable voters weren't sure [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1254.72s)]
*  Watching Trump talk about the one violent day the the one rough hour the shooting shoplifters [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1260.8s)]
*  executing like I get that [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1268.42s)]
*  Republicans and Trump have an advantage on crime and we don't want to play on their territory [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1271.26s)]
*  I just think that that kind of stuff is so extreme and has to do with [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1275.3s)]
*  What Trump wants to do in a second term and not like you said Tommy like the names he's calling Kamala Harris [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1280.98s)]
*  I wouldn't talk about that or anything like that, but I don't know [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1285.8s)]
*  I I think this is I think if you were if you were convincing someone who was going into the voting booth that day [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1288.9s)]
*  That was like a friend of yours who was wavering you'd be like hey this guy's talking about fucking executing people who were arrested for [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1294.9399999999998s)]
*  Dealing drugs or people who are suspected of shoplifting he wants them to shoot like I think that's a fair data point [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1303.54s)]
*  I think most people would watch that and think he doesn't really mean that he's just kidding around [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1309.2199999999998s)]
*  he's talking I I think I unfortunately even if you did with the clips of [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1313.02s)]
*  Shoot the shoplifters execute the drug dealers all that kind of stuff [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1317.1399999999999s)]
*  I mean, I think I think shoot the shoplifters and execute the drug dealers are just different categories think some people might be like yeah [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1320.86s)]
*  Maybe you think about death penalty for some drug dealers [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1325.78s)]
*  I don't think I think they would think he was not serious about shooting shoplifters and I think broadly [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1328.82s)]
*  People have way more harsh views on crime than I'm probably personally that we're personally comfortable with and I don't know [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1333.3799999999999s)]
*  I just don't know that I'd highlight it. Yeah, I I just don't even I like I feel so like unmoored at this point like [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1340.78s)]
*  we're at we're [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1348.54s)]
*  Saying shit like this. We're stuck at 48 48 of this tiny group of people [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1350.54s)]
*  Is this the thing that finally gets them to understand why Trump is so dangerous? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1354.54s)]
*  I really don't feel like I I know [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1357.46s)]
*  anymore like [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1360.7s)]
*  Are there a group of people that are leaning towards Trump that can be peeled toward Kamala not because of something that Kamala does [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1361.54s)]
*  But because of something at long last that Trump says maybe you're right. I don't know [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1368.5s)]
*  Yeah, I was talking to some of our pollsters at focus group folks [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1371.8999999999999s)]
*  We know and they said especially young people and young black and brown men like hearing about universal stop-and-frisk [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1375.86s)]
*  It's like incredibly unpopular and that's just police. That's literally just please stopping and frisking you that's not shooting suspected shoplifters [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1382.16s)]
*  So yeah, actually I totally agree that in general probably the views of crime at this table [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1389.6399999999999s)]
*  Versus like the public's views of crimes are quite different [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1395.42s)]
*  But I think that this is so extreme that it would be I don't know if it moves people but it's very unpopular [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1397.96s)]
*  I think if you're talking about pulling out certain parts of this that would be like like in the [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1402.34s)]
*  Would appeal to like a certain segment of young people that seem open to Trump [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1406.54s)]
*  Like sure like that makes a lot of sense to me [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1410.78s)]
*  but on the whole on the main like I feel like we were back into a couple of cycles of [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1412.98s)]
*  Trump's crazy in a thousand different fucking directions and I like worry about the 2016 effect of like he's saying [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1417.34s)]
*  Oh, he's saying we didn't use to have flies as if immigrants brought all the flies. He's saying crazy shit about crime again [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1423.4599999999998s)]
*  He's making his drug dealer point again and like what was that? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1428.72s)]
*  He called her mentally disabled and like I feel like I'm in a bit of a time warm [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1431.44s)]
*  Yeah, I think that you want to be on the economy [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1434.48s)]
*  Do you want to be on abortion? [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1437.22s)]
*  mm-hmm the only other category of Trump stuff that I sometimes think we should push a little harder on is the [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1438.44s)]
*  using government for violence and [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1445.0800000000002s)]
*  Whether it's the mass deportations whether it's the the shooting the shoplifters [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1447.88s)]
*  but like this stuff is just in a category of like [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1452.5600000000002s)]
*  Even like libertarian leaning [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1455.94s)]
*  Republicans like you're gonna use the federal government to like like when the looting starts the shooting starts, right? [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1458.54s)]
*  Yeah, no, I was trying to take it just a second ago and I don't feel like I was [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1464.46s)]
*  I'm like struggling to do it. But like I think that that kind of gets sorted into like the Trump chaos [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1467.94s)]
*  Extremism bucket and then there's like the Trump economy bucket [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1473.66s)]
*  And I do think there's like a way to put them together and they were not being clear enough with people about like talked about [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1476.22s)]
*  This with Tim actually because we were talking about [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1480.6200000000001s)]
*  Trump's economic speech [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1482.98s)]
*  Which was kind of glossed over because of all the crazy shit [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1485.38s)]
*  He said but inside of it was an actual economic speech and you look at what he's promising and like it could cause a depression [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1488.02s)]
*  It could cause a massive massive massive recession and like we should like that's in the reverse [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1493.22s)]
*  That's what Donald Trump would be saying [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1498.66s)]
*  Why aren't we saying that like Donald Trump's chaos Donald Trump is going to when he left office [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1499.74s)]
*  he left the country with a recession he is promising through tariffs and [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1503.94s)]
*  Mass deportations not only terror for millions of people [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1508.98s)]
*  But an economic calamity if you want to prevent a [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1511.86s)]
*  massive economic crash caused by Donald Trump's chaos [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1516.3s)]
*  mismanagement and [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1520.1399999999999s)]
*  Extremism like to protect the economy you have to vote for Kamala Harris and there's some way to kind of put those things together [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1521.3s)]
*  Yeah [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1525.6599999999999s)]
*  The tariff thing is to I've been an advocate for going hard at the tower tariffs for a while now [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1526.62s)]
*  It is hard for people who like lived through a first Trump term [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1531.4599999999998s)]
*  I think to imagine like well [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1535.2199999999998s)]
*  Why didn't he do this crazy tariff thing in the first term and what's his motivation for doing in the second term? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1536.7399999999998s)]
*  You're gonna be like, I don't know. He's kind of fucking crazy [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1541.1s)]
*  That's like the only explanation as well. He also totally misrepresents what a tariff is [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1543.86s)]
*  Although there's some recent people on immigration that found 56% of registered voters support mass deportations including 27% [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1548.1399999999999s)]
*  Of Harris supporters [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1555.34s)]
*  So it just shows you how far people have moved on immigration and why like Trump is only talking about it [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1556.58s)]
*  The other thing that's interesting from Pew on crime is they they test [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1561.1799999999998s)]
*  People's feelings on crime and whether crime rates are going up or down and in 23 of the last 27 polls [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1565.74s)]
*  I'm I think that's right [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1571.54s)]
*  People thought that crime was going up even when it was going down. So there's clearly just like so much [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1574.34s)]
*  Fear of crime mostly from the media that it distorts views and I'm just not sure how it kind of cuts [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1579.54s)]
*  Oh, well, I definitely think you can't try to tell people much like the economy [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1585.34s)]
*  You can't tell people the crime is going down if they don't feel the crime is going down. I think that's a mistake [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1589.8600000000001s)]
*  So it seems like some of this [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1595.34s)]
*  Crap from Trump was a reaction to Harris going to the border on Friday, which Dan and I previewed a bit on Friday show [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1598.1s)]
*  How do you guys think she did that that event the coverage look good? [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1605.34s)]
*  I mean, I think any opportunity to drive the message that there was this border security bill [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1609.1399999999999s)]
*  Bipartisan the group of lawmakers wanted to pass it and Trump tanked it because he wanted to run the issue [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1614.74s)]
*  I think that's just like a great message. I also thought it let her highlight her work [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1619.4599999999998s)]
*  In California going after drug cartels and drug traffickers [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1623.9399999999998s)]
*  Which I bet you zero percent of voters know about if you were just to sort of ask them and serve an open setting [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1627.78s)]
*  She has gained back some ground on immigration as compared to where Biden was [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1634.58s)]
*  but she's still losing pretty badly on the issue and [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1639.26s)]
*  That similar that same pupil last month found that fifty six percent of registered voters are extremely or very concerned [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1641.74s)]
*  About the number of immigrants entering the country illegally including 27 percent of her supporters [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1648.6599999999999s)]
*  So same numbers as mass deportation. And so, you know, I think [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1653.82s)]
*  What I take from all of this is that her campaign has decided that [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1658.44s)]
*  She needs to look like she thinks the border is a crisis and the immediate priority and we're gonna solve that first and then [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1662.34s)]
*  You move to like a broader more holistic conversation about immigration policy and this visit was a piece of it [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1668.02s)]
*  I think the one criticism you can make is like maybe do this six months ago a year ago [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1675.1399999999999s)]
*  You do it a couple times [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1679.5s)]
*  So it doesn't get called just a stunt as the Chiron on Fox News said as we were walking in but it's worth doing [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1680.58s)]
*  I just remembered I can't remember if it was a [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1686.6999999999998s)]
*  Sarah Longwell focus group or one of those cable focus groups after the debate or something [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1690.26s)]
*  But there was an undecided voter or some swing voter who was like and you know [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1694.26s)]
*  I heard that she when she was in California [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1698.4599999999998s)]
*  She prosecuted some of these gangs these and I was like someone knows [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1701.56s)]
*  Great that's a mission accomplished there that's one [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1708.36s)]
*  Yeah, I watched I went just I was like what does this look like if you're in Phoenix or something? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1711.08s)]
*  And like what is that the border coverage look like and [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1715.4s)]
*  The images are great. It's her walking with like police in front of the wall [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1719.08s)]
*  It's very kind of like law enforcement kind of border security [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1722.72s)]
*  I think they're like the remarks were great all that was great [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1725.72s)]
*  See the challenge of trying to like make a dent or like is sort of a we'll get to the polling which is like how [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1728.6999999999998s)]
*  Challenging this media environment is because you watch a local affiliate. It's images of her at the border [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1734.06s)]
*  Then they go to a Trump surrogate who's basically saying like she was the borders are who failed [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1739.1s)]
*  She hasn't been here since she was an elected which is a false [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1744.06s)]
*  And then they say alright [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1746.86s)]
*  Well, let's cut to Kamala Harris's remarks on the border [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1748.1399999999999s)]
*  Happened to be the part of the speech where she was doing acknowledgments [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1750.34s)]
*  So they cut from a Trump aid going like she's never done a thing for the border and then it's her just [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1752.9399999999998s)]
*  Applauding and like pointing at people and you're just like man. It just get to Tommy's point about like doing this [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1757.3400000000001s)]
*  What's like you just it's reps it's going again [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1762.98s)]
*  It's like doing then going and doing interviews with these affiliates to talk about it more [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1764.74s)]
*  It's just you have to hit it over and over and over again [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1768.3s)]
*  also if you are making a speech about a policy that [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1770.38s)]
*  Your supporters and your voters are excited about they're going to spread the message and they're gonna help you spread that message [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1774.9s)]
*  Which is tough to do in this media environment if you are going to play defense on [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1781.26s)]
*  Border security which is what she's doing and look there's a lot of undecided swing voters are saying like I'm not sure about her on the border [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1785.9s)]
*  Right. I'm not sure about her on immigration and it's along with the economy. Those are the two things holding a lot of these voters back [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1792.66s)]
*  But it's just like you're not gonna get a bunch of your supporters to go and be like look at her on the border [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1799.1s)]
*  It was so exciting. She was really tough on security. Like it's just a hard thing to get out there, right? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1804.52s)]
*  It's like you're trying to like you're trying to beat him on temperament extremism [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1809.82s)]
*  Trying to beat him on abortion try to fight to a draw on the economy and you're trying to like mitigate your losses on [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1813.62s)]
*  Immigration like to Tommy's point about why mass deportation [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1819.3s)]
*  Pulls so well, there's no conversation about whether or not there should be a mass deportation. It's people saying well [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1823.06s)]
*  Yeah, I do agree that there's a huge problem at the border the impact of it or the impact about it [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1828.98s)]
*  And so yeah, you show people videos of people like federal agents raiding workforce offices and homes [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1832.48s)]
*  I think they're not as excited about it, right? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1839.06s)]
*  But but but then what happens is Donald Trump's out there saying this is what we need this is how we'll solve the problem [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1840.78s)]
*  Correctly the Harris campaign is saying let's talk about border security. Let's talk about Trump killing the bill [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1847.42s)]
*  Let's talk about a better immigration system and then there's no actual debate about this heinous and terrible policy [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1851.6200000000001s)]
*  As you said love it. We keep getting more polls. They keep showing that the race is more tied than the last polls [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1857.5s)]
*  That's possible [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1864.3s)]
*  New York Times Sienna once again Saturday morning we all get up and more more New York Times Sienna polls [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1866.46s)]
*  Harris leads 49 47 in Wisconsin [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1872.54s)]
*  48 47 in Michigan [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1876.22s)]
*  There was a Fox News poll out on Friday that had Harris up to in Pennsylvania, but tied among likely voters blah blah blah [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1879.02s)]
*  It's all the same. Are we just stuck here till Election Day? Is this what's gonna happen? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1885.3s)]
*  Yeah, I mean like it in my dark moments [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1889.74s)]
*  I wonder if we spend years of our lives in billions of dollars on campaigns and in the end [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1892.22s)]
*  What really matters is like the meta media narrative at the last week last week? Yeah, you know [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1896.74s)]
*  Like the late deciders and where they break it's made me worry [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1902.78s)]
*  Tommy to that point that like the Trump people know this because that's how they won in 16 and they're just like [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1905.94s)]
*  Waiting to just throw some kind of shit at the wall in the last two me. Yeah [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1911.14s)]
*  They'll make what they don't have to [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1915.3s)]
*  Has enough to have a kernel of truth though. There's gonna look for sure [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1917.66s)]
*  I will say like even if what you're saying is true [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1920.02s)]
*  Let's that the campaigns create the space for that that like final two weeks to unfold [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1924.06s)]
*  I also like I just I think we don't know that like I think it's very possible that the race is frozen and like [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1930.34s)]
*  the very like no campaign is perfect, but like [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1934.94s)]
*  Kamala Harris is like doing what she is supposed to do what like her like she has very smart people around her [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1939.14s)]
*  They are running an enthusiastic campaign. They're doing everything they're supposed to do Trump is selling fucking watches and [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1944.22s)]
*  careening [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1950.06s)]
*  Launching and they're tied and then the question is like is that a genuine like I think there's the race could be genuinely tied and [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1952.06s)]
*  This politics is all going through like the information mandolin and like ending up is shredded on the bottom. That's possible [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1959.14s)]
*  It's also possible that these polls are accurate [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1964.42s)]
*  But it's just very hard to measure the like shifts between leaners [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1967.28s)]
*  Shifts in enthusiasm tiny shifts amongst undecided voters that even if the the polls are creating an accurate picture what's happening? [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1971.6200000000001s)]
*  They're not able to measure these subtle and qualitative differences, which you do see in focus groups, right? [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1977.22s)]
*  There is a difference in the focus groups between how they talked about Biden versus Trump versus how they talk about [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1981.22s)]
*  Harris versus Trump and that would just be hard to measure [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1985.5s)]
*  The other is that like all of this polling like we may we may discover after this election that the ways in which they were [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1987.8600000000001s)]
*  Trying to correct for errors after 2016 and 2020 created [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1993.98s)]
*  totally weird results because those were weird elections between [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=1998.02s)]
*  Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump between Joe Biden and Donald Trump during a pandemic and now this election where we finally have a candidate a lot [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2001.7s)]
*  Of people are enthusiastic about finally a normal election [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2008.1399999999999s)]
*  Well, it's like so between two between a vice president the answer is who knows [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2011.58s)]
*  But we just won't know till after I know I'm saying that was a joke in my dark moments [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2017.86s)]
*  I think that I obviously registering voters matters Geo TV of matters [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2021.8s)]
*  But ultimately like we're talking about 10% of the population [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2025.18s)]
*  Undecided and trying to convince them and it's just it sucks [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2028.02s)]
*  And again, I like I don't I think people you hear undecided and you think that those people are all torn between the two candidates [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2031.22s)]
*  and they're just checked out a lot of them are checked out and [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2037.34s)]
*  You know, I just [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2040.98s)]
*  Alex Wagner did a focus group of Michigan voters [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2042.74s)]
*  Last week and just hearing some of them you could it's so funny because you can tell the difference between [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2046.46s)]
*  The voters who've been paying attention to this race and they talk about the convention speech or Trump did this and then the other ones [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2051.86s)]
*  Are just like I haven't looked enough about Kamala Harris. I know she's a new candidate. I got to check it out [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2057.26s)]
*  I do remember I had more money in my pocket when Trump was president, but I don't know [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2061.82s)]
*  He seems kind of crazy [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2066.5s)]
*  I mean that you just hear the same shit and they're gonna they are gonna tune in those last couple weeks [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2067.42s)]
*  Yeah, Michigan numbers or people are gonna, you know knock on their doors and or the campaign is gonna be on the ground [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2071.26s)]
*  You're gonna have an organizer. They're gonna hear from a volunteer and again one conversation is not gonna do it [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2076.86s)]
*  But if they're gonna start thinking okay, I got some new information from that person. That's interesting [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2081.6600000000003s)]
*  I do think they're because the race has been so static and because it's so close like it's hard to know the difference between [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2085.22s)]
*  Are there just a group of people that are very hard to persuade or are they being persuaded? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2089.8599999999997s)]
*  And it's just not showing up in the numbers and we just we just don't know it's very hard to measure [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2094.18s)]
*  It's getting a little hot war in Lebanon closes thing out close strong some more chaos and death and destruction overseas [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2097.7s)]
*  Maybe shovel some cash over there. Can't you fix that? That's supposed to be your other podcast Rhodes is working on it [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2104.8999999999996s)]
*  Rhodes is working on it. He's doing his thing [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2110.12s)]
*  Got it, I'm not doing my job. I know I know the joke and I was gonna do it too. We didn't know there is one more [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2112.3599999999997s)]
*  Quote unquote big moment left on the calendar Tuesday nights VP debate JD Vance and Tim Walls will meet on stage at CBS [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2118.56s)]

*  Like the Harris Trump debate, it'll be 90 minutes with no audience [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2129.08s)]
*  Unlike the Harris Trump debate both candidates mics will be on the entire time [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2132.2s)]
*  The moderators are Nora O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2136.16s)]
*  We know that Pete Buttigieg has been playing Vance in walls as debate prep sessions in that Minnesota congressman [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2139.6s)]
*  Tom Emmer has been playing walls in Vance's sessions [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2145.2s)]
*  The walls team has been trying to set expectations with leaks about walls being nervous and not a great debater [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2148.3199999999997s)]
*  The RNC did a preview call about the debate and teased that Vance will call walls trader Tim [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2153.9599999999996s)]
*  For allegedly abandoning his National Guard unit when they went to Iraq [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2159.12s)]
*  So are they is it gonna be trader tampon Tim or tampon trader Tim? Are they gonna just drop tampon? [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2163.22s)]
*  Good question. Yeah [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2168.8399999999997s)]
*  Great I should look great. That's good. They should do that. What a prick. How are you guys feeling about the expectation set? [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2172.4399999999996s)]
*  Do you buy the expectation setting? Do you not? What do you think? I'm a little nervous [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2178.08s)]
*  I watched some of Tim Walls is Minnesota public radio debate from last year against Scott Jensen barnburner Scott Jensen [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2182.12s)]
*  It wasn't great. He seemed pretty nervous. He was a little gruff got a little defensive [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2189.3199999999997s)]
*  The answers were always totally smooth or coherent and so I you know [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2193.44s)]
*  He's probably doing exponentially more prep this time than the last time but you know, the stakes couldn't are a lot higher and [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2197.56s)]
*  Tim Walls hasn't been doing any interviews like the lack of reps could make him rusty [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2204.6800000000003s)]
*  He's also he's now defending Kamala Harris's record something he learned about for the first time two months ago [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2209.28s)]
*  like think about how complicated that is you're not you're not like [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2215.32s)]
*  Defending your own legislative record or time as governor what you know inside and out you're talking about this person you you barely knew [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2219.48s)]
*  Three months ago as opposed to JD Vance who's been doing fucking mop-up duty for Donald Trump for four years [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2225.88s)]
*  Publicly while attacking him privately and so I like JD [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2231.6s)]
*  Again, he's been out there. He's doing press conferences. He's doing hostile interviews. They're not always good [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2235.36s)]
*  He's not always helping the cause [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2240.0s)]
*  But he's got a lot of reps and he's an obnoxious like slippery little shit who is kind of good at this stuff [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2241.6s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a critic a Socratic forum is a good forum for JD Vance JD Vance is better in one-on-one [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2247.04s)]
*  Interviews that are contentious with like a national news reporter than he is on the stump or talking to someone trying to sell him a [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2252.6s)]
*  Donut he's better in he's better in the green room. He's better in like fighter well-lit environments [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2258.12s)]
*  He was he's a green room creature and I do worry about that [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2262.88s)]
*  But what I what I was thinking about about this debate was actually the the John Edwards [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2266.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't know why it's it's it's 2004 for me right now [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2271.66s)]
*  Came out of the fucking time capsule you support the surge [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2275.44s)]
*  Yeah, so the reason I was thinking let me tell you about the last time [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2277.76s)]
*  I remember a disaster relief situation in politics 2004 [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2280.36s)]
*  I do well, so this is a coincidence, but the reason I was thinking about 2004 is because [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2283.92s)]
*  You know dick Cheney had became like kind of like it was had this reputation of being a political hero. Yeah, sure [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2289.2s)]
*  Became this sort of like, you know [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2295.76s)]
*  This political Darth Vader and John Edwards was this charming lawyer and they had this debate where they kind of folks [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2297.32s)]
*  Seated up and had a really kind of mild mannered good time [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2303.38s)]
*  And I think it were down to two Jake Cheney's benefit because John Edwards made dick Cheney seemed like a normal person in that debate [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2306.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and the only thing I remember from it is him kind of really awkwardly being like your daughter who was a lesbian [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2312.4s)]
*  Yeah, he that was a weird moment doing John but like John but but dick Cheney came out [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2317.7400000000002s)]
*  Well out of that debate and I was a little worried about that [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2322.26s)]
*  Like that like, you know [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2324.3s)]
*  Tim waltz is gonna kind of like end up in this sort of folks each [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2325.5s)]
*  Conversation with JD Vance and JD Vance comes away looking vaguely normal because he's in conversation with a normal guy [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2328.34s)]
*  That was my concern but the fact that they're previewing this trader thing [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2333.04s)]
*  I think that's fucking great [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2335.82s)]
*  Like the more JD Vance is coming coming after Tim waltz and Tim waltz can just be like I'm proud of my service to my country [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2336.84s)]
*  Let's talk about Donald Trump. Let's talk about Kamala Harris [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2342.2799999999997s)]
*  I think the better and I think that would be a pretty stupid strategy real waste JD Vance [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2344.08s)]
*  So which makes me think it's a head fake, but who knows I do I buy the spin from the walls camp [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2348.74s)]
*  Someone in the CNN piece about this recalls walls saying I think at a fundraiser as teachers [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2354.6s)]
*  We're trained to answer the question and we train our students to answer the questions. That's not how this goes [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2360.52s)]
*  Barack Obama also a teacher felt the same way. He was not always great at debates. Kamala Harris was a prosecutor [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2365.84s)]
*  That's like this debates are more her style like the way that you prepare for a trial, you know [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2373.0s)]
*  So I do I worry a little bit, you know about about walls [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2378.0s)]
*  But I don't know [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2381.32s)]
*  Maybe he's practiced a bunch and and maybe Pete really gave it to him good and now he's he's already [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2381.9s)]
*  And then had the debate prep. Okay, Jesus [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2387.08s)]
*  Thought it [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2391.08s)]
*  I don't have the permission structure [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2393.84s)]
*  I'd also was texting with some people on the walls team be like you ready to dominate and they're like, you know [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2398.2400000000002s)]
*  Not quite how we're feeling but we're making progress [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2403.84s)]
*  So they're they're they're playing things down publicly and privately [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2405.68s)]
*  That's and then there's a Pete you guys meet the piece in the New York Times about JD Vance and his past debates [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2408.32s)]
*  That was like an expectations [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2413.52s)]
*  That was yeah, it's like the walls campaign placed it [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2416.36s)]
*  But it was like basically all about how great how JD Vance was like made for debates [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2419.24s)]
*  Just not what you said, you know, and apparently in hillbilly elegy. He talked about [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2422.7999999999997s)]
*  How he in the Marines he did media relations for the Marines? [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2427.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and he said the experience taught me a valuable lesson that I could do it [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2432.08s)]
*  I could work 20-hour days when I had to I could speak clearly and confidently with TV cameras shoved in my face [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2435.9199999999996s)]
*  so this is a guy who's been like practicing doing this for a long time and [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2440.16s)]
*  You're right. Like I think [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2444.3599999999997s)]
*  interacting with humans [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2446.4799999999996s)]
*  Sort of tough but like a debate stage white nationalist podcasts great preparation for a debate [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2448.2s)]
*  And I think this the smarter strategy for JD Vance [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2453.8799999999997s)]
*  Then the traitor Tim stuff would be to run the play that Donald Trump was supposed to run at the Harris Trump debate and forget [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2457.04s)]
*  about Tim Walls and make Tim Walls answer for like [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2463.3999999999996s)]
*  Kamala Harris and all of the unpopular parts of the Biden Harris record and then her stuff like that's that that's what I [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2468.12s)]
*  Yeah, what's confusing though about JD Vance is like he seems smart enough to know that and then he goes on social media and like [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2475.04s)]
*  Starts bickering with reporters all day. So yeah, there's an angel on devil on his shoulder. Well, and they're both assholes [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2480.4s)]
*  Fucking worst angel you'd ever fucking meet is such a weirdo, you know [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2489.6000000000004s)]
*  You could see him getting triggered by Nora and Margaret too because he's like these [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2493.4s)]
*  They're just like shouting questions at him and he just he already has an antagonistic relationship with every reporter [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2498.4s)]
*  And so I could see him. Yeah, I got real mad at Dana bash. Yep. I could see that too [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2503.96s)]
*  If you were walls, would you go after him for? [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2508.32s)]
*  The shitty things he said or would you keep it all about Trump? [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2511.64s)]
*  I was thinking about this over the weekend and I think the one place I would kind of go after JD Vance repeatedly is be like [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2514.18s)]
*  JD I was a teacher for many years [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2520.76s)]
*  I had a lot of students like you like kids who were in a hurry to make a name for themselves and be someone and they [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2522.48s)]
*  Were willing to say and do anything to get there [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2528.38s)]
*  Like that's how you end up being the attack dog for a guy who doesn't care about working people who in [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2530.64s)]
*  2020 you said had failed to deliver as president [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2536.42s)]
*  I'm gonna DM and now you're running around the country [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2539.4s)]
*  you know telling lies and trying to divide the country and then you try to like [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2542.48s)]
*  Create this narrative around JD that becomes a motive for everything [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2546.68s)]
*  He says and kind of undercuts him and sort of gets at his lack of qualifications for the jobs [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2551.66s)]
*  Maybe you slip in a couple lines about how old Trump is but yeah [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2556.64s)]
*  No, I don't think you're going after the greatest oppo hits [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2559.8799999999997s)]
*  Like maybe you're mentioning some of the top ones like childless cat ladies or lying about the hits migrants in in, Ohio [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2562.8799999999997s)]
*  But yeah, I mean most of this is gonna be just the Trump show and making him defend Trump couldn't agree more though [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2570.48s)]
*  That was a great. That's a great strategy to have like one [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2575.66s)]
*  One motivation for JD Vance and his career and just like keep coming back to that right? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2578.4s)]
*  Which is just trying to yeah do anything to get more power? [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2582.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I do think using the new stuff about the 2020 like even after Donald Trump's presidency [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2585.7799999999997s)]
*  You were saying these things which is which is new and he'll feel obligated to respond and his response is pretty bad [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2590.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't I don't know if we've do we cover this on this show. I think just so everyone knows we're talking about [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2594.2999999999997s)]
*  there was [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2600.2999999999997s)]
*  Washington Post story about this that JD Vance was [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2601.66s)]
*  Direct messaging on Twitter with someone where he said in 2020 that Trump quote thoroughly failed to deliver on [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2605.06s)]
*  Economic populism. Yep, and [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2614.2s)]
*  So I pretty damning one of the more damning JD Vance quotes even more damning that line was followed by it parenthetical [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2616.52s)]
*  Accepting a disjointed China policy who says accepting [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2624.0s)]
*  JD Vance the the y'all yeah [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2627.8399999999997s)]
*  I do think that's like pretty pretty damning and his defense is like I was saying how establishment Republicans let him down [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2630.08s)]
*  Which is sort of sure embarrassing. Okay, buddy, but he'll feel obligated because he'll know Trump is watching. Oh god [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2636.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, and I have to respond so have to respond the only if I was walls [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2642.52s)]
*  I would look for I mean that's one opportunity but other opportunities to drive a wedge between Trump and Vance [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2646.64s)]
*  With either different positions they've had or remember when Vance fucked up by saying that [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2653.2s)]
*  Donald Trump would veto a national abortion ban [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2658.6s)]
*  Yeah, Trump said I never told them that right like I would I would look for hammer him on that [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2660.96s)]
*  Yeah [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2664.92s)]
*  for sure and know that Trump's watching and try to get make him be a supplicant for Trump and [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2665.24s)]
*  Just embarrass himself like I think that's a real audience of ones situation for for JD [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2669.3199999999997s)]
*  What's a win for walls look like? [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2675.7999999999997s)]
*  It's like a relentless message about Trump being in this for himself and not working people and then just getting JD on defense [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2678.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think a draw is a win do no harm and yeah [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2684.72s)]
*  And just saying how great Kamala is and her record and her you know her plans and everything like that [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2689.2s)]
*  I mean because again, she I would say the only [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2694.56s)]
*  missed opportunity [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2697.16s)]
*  Not really miss cuz she didn't have the time but in the last debate [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2698.8s)]
*  She didn't get to talk as much about her plans her policies her values stuff like that [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2701.92s)]
*  She did but I think that walls could probably do that for her even better because he's essentially a surrogate for her and not just [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2707.2400000000002s)]
*  Hurt bragging yeah, she went back to like aspirations and ambitions, but she didn't go back to the details that much [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2713.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2717.6800000000003s)]
*  I think I think I think a win will be a debate in which it felt like Tim Walz was kind of putting JD event [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2718.1600000000003s)]
*  It's very similar [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2723.8s)]
*  Sort of a mirror image of Trump like JD Vance is gonna be a smarter more sophisticated kind of [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2725.44s)]
*  Bulldozer coming at him [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2730.64s)]

*  We've had a convention a debate millions in ads [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2936.1200000000003s)]
*  saturated media coverage and and basically non-stop polling that shows a race that is [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2939.6400000000003s)]
*  Essentially tied with five weeks to go. I know the last few elections have been pretty close. So this is unusual [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2945.88s)]
*  I can't remember a race where the polling has been this tight for this long [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2952.16s)]
*  What do you think is going on? [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2957.08s)]
*  well, first of all in this century the only [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2959.64s)]
*  candidate [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2964.16s)]
*  That went woke up election morning knowing they were gonna win was the Obama 2008 [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2965.2s)]
*  We were still a little nervous [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2971.48s)]
*  It was a good [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2973.96s)]
*  Everything else you might have thought you were a little better shape, but you didn't know right you certainly didn't know in 2012 [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2976.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean Robin is actually shocked at he lost. I mean it was like he went there thinking he was gonna win [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2982.2400000000002s)]
*  So it's not unusual and what I will say [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2986.92s)]
*  They usually break in the end [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2991.32s)]
*  So if there's seven swing states the most unlikely result is a break for three. Hmm, they're gonna break [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=2993.4s)]
*  All together more more likely than not in [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3001.16s)]
*  My instinct and business nothing but instinct is you know, Kentucky windage [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3005.24s)]
*  That it'll break Harris's way, but that's only instinct. There's no good. There's no evidence to support that [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3010.6s)]
*  Were you surprised at how fast the party came together around her candidacy and how fast her? [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3016.88s)]
*  favorability ratings went up [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3024.88s)]
*  No, no, I think I think it was clear that people just wanted something different it were like what 72% weren't something different [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3030.72s)]
*  60% of the Democrats did [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3038.96s)]
*  and [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3041.04s)]
*  you know what I was the analogy I would use is that if [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3042.32s)]
*  You have infected wisdom tooth and they pull it you feel great [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3046.56s)]
*  You don't feel any better than you'd have felt if you didn't have the wisdom tooth [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3050.84s)]
*  The fact that the wisdom tooth is gone. You're like gee, I'm from top of the world now [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3054.56s)]
*  and I think you had some of that effect like [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3058.72s)]
*  in the way that [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3063.2799999999997s)]
*  It was 1245 central time almost to the minute when I got the first text [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3065.7999999999997s)]
*  in by I was listening to [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3072.3599999999997s)]
*  You know political radio I forgot what it was then you get an hour at [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3076.12s)]
*  145 central you knew that it already called that there was no no appetite for anything else [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3082.04s)]
*  Yeah, were you worried at all that because I know you were initially concerned that it would appear [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3087.6s)]
*  either she was anointed by the party or or or even another Democratic nominee would or not and look she did earn the [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3092.56s)]
*  nomination but [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3099.52s)]
*  You know, it's about there was no other challengers about 24 hours [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3100.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you know Simon if if President Biden would have dropped out in June the 58th [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3103.7999999999997s)]
*  They might have been yeah a lot of well one things that I do believe [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3108.88s)]
*  That the level of talent in the current Democratic Party is the highest level of talent [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3113.4s)]
*  I've seen a political party in my lifetime. I mean if you look at [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3120.0s)]
*  The potential presidential candidates we had they're all like really world-class talent. Yeah, and Harris [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3124.08s)]
*  Has kind of proved herself to be a lot better than people [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3132.2000000000003s)]
*  Thought the other thing that I would have people tell me that you know, she's gotten a lot better [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3136.84s)]
*  I'd like people working the White House is she's become more confident [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3143.44s)]
*  She has better staff work. I think they bought Lorraine in [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3147.28s)]
*  So I'm [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3151.36s)]
*  I'm gratified. I didn't [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3152.92s)]
*  You know, I saw her 2000 presidential campaign whoo, man, I think stunk but she's grown. She has she really has [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3155.12s)]
*  It feels like Trump and Kamala are in a battle for voters attention [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3162.56s)]
*  Which is increasingly harder to come by these days the state of the media [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3166.16s)]
*  I think it's it's one big reason that the Harris folks really want a second debate so far Trump's not giving it to them [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3169.8399999999997s)]
*  What do you think her campaign can do to break through in these last few weeks any creative ideas to grab people's attention? [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3176.3999999999996s)]
*  The answer is yes. Okay, first of all [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3184.8399999999997s)]
*  What they do is they do big events very well [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3188.08s)]
*  Yeah, the vice president rollout there you could say maybe a couple of city picture bureau [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3191.04s)]
*  I don't know but there was a very well done the convention [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3194.96s)]
*  You couldn't walk away from there and not say it's one of the better conventions you ever had [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3198.48s)]
*  You certainly couldn't walk away from the debate and not say that they did did did a real good job in preparing her [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3203.56s)]
*  I kind of knew some of the people that were in prep, but I really very confident. She was gonna do well [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3210.48s)]
*  What is less certain is [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3215.2599999999998s)]
*  How aggressive they are day to day [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3218.9s)]
*  And how they don't take a story and kick it but so Trump says I don't like to pay people a minimum wage [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3221.54s)]
*  I just don't pay them then I mean a overtime. I remember overtime and project [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3228.46s)]
*  2025 has this overtime provision. I [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3234.2599999999998s)]
*  Wish they would be kicking the crap out of this all day. I wish they were like flooding [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3237.5s)]
*  TV like come on people work overtime. They want to get paid [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3242.86s)]
*  You know hourly workers overtime is everything to them [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3247.6200000000003s)]
*  So I thought that they could kick that a lot harder and [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3253.1800000000003s)]
*  What I hope that they do coming down the stretch is push us push it story [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3257.2000000000003s)]
*  Every day. Yeah, and a lot of it is just the stuff they're proposing on taxes [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3263.5800000000004s)]
*  People don't like the other one they should be just kicking the crap out of is the tower stuff [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3269.98s)]
*  Hmm, you see me down for an Iowa. That's understandable agrarian people can't stand towers. They have a terrible [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3275.34s)]
*  Industrial people some are naive enough to think there's gonna do some good that that's I [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3285.5s)]
*  Think they should be pushing [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3291.9s)]
*  the Peterson Institute [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3294.1400000000003s)]
*  Which okay about it is we know but that but but it's all credible people say this is gonna be a [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3296.2599999999998s)]
*  $2,500 3000 owned every family. I [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3303.02s)]
*  Wish they would push that hard. Yeah, I mean this has been a problem for years now [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3306.14s)]
*  But Trump gives you so many different targets every day because he's a bunch of crazy shit all the time [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3310.66s)]
*  She has the added challenge of voters saying well, I want to know more about her [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3316.1s)]
*  I want to know what she's gonna do as president [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3320.46s)]
*  But then you've got Trump up there saying he's talking about the tariffs he's talking about mass deportations political prosecutions [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3323.2999999999997s)]
*  He just talked about going after shoplifting by letting police do whatever they want for one rough hour [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3329.22s)]
*  How do you think she should balance talking about herself and talking about him? How do you know? I think [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3334.22s)]
*  That if she ran hard if they push the tower stuff people would find out something about her [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3340.7s)]
*  Hmm, I think if they push the overtime stuff if they push something simple that everybody is far [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3345.9s)]
*  But they just don't do the minimum wage just get some time to give America a raise everybody else in the world who's gotten a race [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3352.46s)]
*  But Americans and I got a race [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3359.5s)]
*  And I read a York Times story. It's so predictable [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3361.9s)]
*  She did the interview with I guess Stephanie rule. Hmm. And of course, it's the same pissy thing [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3365.7400000000002s)]
*  Well, she really didn't say anything. It was a lack of specificity [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3371.06s)]
*  It hidden in the story [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3375.34s)]
*  Was the fact that she'd put out an 81 page economic plan, yeah, like why didn't [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3378.34s)]
*  So you we had a in 92 we had an 85 page economic plan [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3385.2200000000003s)]
*  No one ever read a word of it, including me, but there is actually [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3390.5s)]
*  Blanching lacks specific. She's not talking about the issues in any depth [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3393.98s)]
*  It's just this bromides and well actually [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3399.3s)]
*  She does have an 81 economic plans no danger that I'm gonna read it [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3403.42s)]
*  But I think if people knew that yeah, you have to said check out 81 page economic plan on page 32. She says [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3409.1s)]
*  We need to increase the minimum wage to 12 [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3418.22s)]
*  85 an hour [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3421.74s)]
*  Pretty good. All we need to take taxes over raise tax on people make over [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3423.3799999999997s)]
*  $400,000 and put it in a first time homebuyer mortgage relief fund to help young people buy houses. Yeah [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3428.5s)]
*  Anything like that, you know is gonna be massively popular [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3435.02s)]
*  It pointed out but the York Times is never gonna say that she has economic specificity, right? [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3439.42s)]
*  Because she's just you always say that no matter what yeah and when she does interviews, too [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3446.7000000000003s)]
*  She can answer questions by saying oh if you want to know more you have this whole I have this whole book out there [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3451.58s)]
*  And by the way, here's what Trump wants to do. Yeah [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3457.9s)]
*  There are I [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3461.2200000000003s)]
*  Do I do think they can be more aggressive I think they can fight for the new cycle [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3464.26s)]
*  And I think that just you know [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3472.94s)]
*  You don't get the back where one day you get a bunch of good stories and you pull that night and you say well shit [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3474.9s)]
*  We didn't move [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3479.6800000000003s)]
*  You got to keep building stuff up. Mm-hmm. So polling shows a big gender gap [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3480.94s)]
*  Including it, especially between young women and young men white men Hispanic men even black men [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3487.62s)]
*  It's been like the big demographic debate of 2024 [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3494.14s)]
*  Do you think this is a dynamic that is specific to Trump and the current version of the Democratic Party? [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3497.3s)]
*  Or is it bigger than that? How do you think about it? [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3503.38s)]
*  Well, yeah [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3506.3s)]
*  Been pretty outspoken. We don't do as well near as well with males as I think is gonna do and John [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3508.02s)]
*  you know that every [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3514.82s)]
*  Election brings about a fashionable demographic [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3517.34s)]
*  NASCAR dads soccer moms [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3520.18s)]
*  Women of color I [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3523.86s)]
*  think that the [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3526.1s)]
*  Demographic in this cycle with the most elasticity [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3528.1s)]
*  She's in they'll get in trouble [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3531.5s)]
*  Sayiness of in some quarters, but our college educated white males. I think we have a lot of ups [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3533.98s)]
*  Why do I say that first of all, they tend to be more pro-choice? [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3540.42s)]
*  Than non-college right white males, you know, I'm sorry, but we have mothers wives [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3544.5400000000004s)]
*  children [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3551.5400000000004s)]
*  friends [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3552.6600000000003s)]
*  but it in [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3553.94s)]
*  So much of this has become that [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3556.26s)]
*  It's it's a abortion is a women's issue. It's actually a somewhat of a male issue, too [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3559.3s)]
*  and [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3565.42s)]
*  The other reason I think that there's upside is [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3566.46s)]
*  You know because of obvious reasons [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3569.86s)]
*  They're more invested in the stock market they have more to lose. So I do think we have some [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3571.98s)]
*  We can't do any better than we're doing in post-bachelor white women, right? [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3579.58s)]
*  We certainly can do better with [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3584.02s)]
*  Younger black males that that's a that's a problem that I think to a large you said our cultures help create that [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3586.58s)]
*  But I think the trendy demographic [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3594.6600000000003s)]
*  or [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3598.5s)]
*  college white males [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3599.46s)]
*  And what do you think? What do you think is the best way to? [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3601.5s)]
*  Lock down college white males or sort of keep keep talking about abortion [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3605.06s)]
*  You can talk about freedom and say that Trump says so the argument is is it a good economy a bad economy? [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3609.82s)]
*  You see it's very hard to talk people into something that they don't believe [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3619.06s)]
*  But Trump gave us a tremendous opening. He says you have nothing to lose [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3624.78s)]
*  We're gonna try everything because it's all in a toilet. I don't think people look at it that way [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3629.66s)]
*  I think people say well, yeah, I got a job [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3635.7799999999997s)]
*  I think most people if you say, you know, I feel pretty good about the next year a year and a half. Yeah [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3637.7799999999997s)]
*  you know some people may have a [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3643.9s)]
*  Savings account, you know, you know, maybe they're doing a little better [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3647.06s)]
*  In so if the question is is it good or bad? [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3650.98s)]
*  That's not the question we should be asked do you have something to lose in this can you do better? Yes [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3656.38s)]
*  But if we do things like start slapping tariffs on everything [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3661.1800000000003s)]
*  What we're not gonna we're not gonna do very well this you got you have something to lose it and he keeps running these ads [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3667.78s)]
*  What the hell you got to lose? [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3675.34s)]
*  actually [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3677.86s)]
*  Fair amount. Yeah, it's not just [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3679.3s)]
*  People like you and I didn't have something to lose a [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3683.02s)]
*  Pipe that I have something to lose. Yeah, I mean that guy [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3685.94s)]
*  Joshi is going down to the Union Hall and that work every day. Yeah [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3689.54s)]
*  I know you've taken your share of shit for warning Democrats about identity politics and woke language and all that [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3695.38s)]
*  I've always wondered about this from the perspective of [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3702.02s)]
*  Democratic politicians like 99% of whom don't actually talk like that [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3705.18s)]
*  They get tagged as you know woke party because of activists and people on social media that they have very little control over [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3710.1s)]
*  If you're a democratic politician or working for one, what do you what do you do about this issue? [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3716.7s)]
*  Well, first of all, no one uses that language [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3722.62s)]
*  I mean it just stopped. Okay, and [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3725.4599999999996s)]
*  It started and it was like an idea [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3728.3799999999997s)]
*  That never caught on [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3732.7s)]
*  All right, so there's no chance that [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3735.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I tell people and this is true. I [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3738.3799999999997s)]
*  You saw the film I probably had more encounters with black people than any Democratic consultant just where I grew up and where I live [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3742.62s)]
*  And if I saw like which I see all the time [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3750.2599999999998s)]
*  It is to say there's three black guys who were shooting the ball out in front of the supermarket if I walked up and I said [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3752.74s)]
*  Good morning fellas. How are things in the community of color today? [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3757.7799999999997s)]
*  What's this giant ass motherfucker talking about? Okay [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3760.98s)]
*  what I was saying and [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3764.7799999999997s)]
*  I think it was a [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3767.5s)]
*  Well intentioned people that just made a giant mistake and [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3770.66s)]
*  They tried to lead and no one followed them and the best thing we can do is just move on if we don't need to go [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3776.18s)]
*  remind [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3783.7s)]
*  NPR that no one talks like that that everybody knows no one talks like that anymore. There's no danger [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3785.98s)]
*  That Adam Schiff is gonna be running for Senate in California and start talking about [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3795.22s)]
*  Latinx or something. It's not gonna happen. There's no value in that [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3801.58s)]
*  I love the documentary focuses on your life your career your marriage [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3805.98s)]
*  A good chunk of it is also about your your very vocal push to get Biden to step aside [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3810.7799999999997s)]
*  Which was a bit of a lonely crusade before the debate [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3815.8199999999997s)]
*  I know that you probably weren't too concerned with the criticism you received during that period [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3819.6200000000003s)]
*  There is a moment in the doc where you worry aloud about becoming [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3825.1800000000003s)]
*  One of those people you used to hate the goddamn carping Democratic pundits who were never satisfied [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3828.9s)]
*  How do you think about giving advice that's still? [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3834.34s)]
*  Pertinent and persuasive even though you're not working inside these campaigns like you used to you [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3838.1800000000003s)]
*  so you and I work in campaigns and [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3843.5800000000004s)]
*  You would see people on television [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3847.34s)]
*  Son of a bitch has no idea what he's talking about [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3849.54s)]
*  We're sitting there 16 hours a day trying to you know crank out a schedule trying to get [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3852.26s)]
*  spots written and talking points pushed and you know doing vocal TV hits and [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3857.86s)]
*  This assholes popping off [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3866.42s)]
*  And I always it so here here he says well [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3868.7000000000003s)]
*  That guy is sitting there and you know knocking down [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3872.54s)]
*  $35,000 of speech and you know sitting on TV [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3877.46s)]
*  And I've always hated that kind of person yeah, and that's so true that I had become [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3880.9s)]
*  That which I had always detested [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3888.06s)]
*  but I [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3891.22s)]
*  Just didn't because I was old if you see the documentary. It's pretty clear that I'm in the midst of the aging process [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHxzXKw1hlM&t=3893.1s)]
