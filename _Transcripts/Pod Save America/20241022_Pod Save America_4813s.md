Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

**Pod Save America:** [October 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys)
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm John Favreau. I'm John Lovett. I'm Tommy Vitor. Wow. Okay on today's show an [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=0.0s)]

*  I'd much rather be talking burgers and flipping dicks [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=14.24s)]
*  Surprise you guys Kamala Harris continues her sprint through the battlegrounds with help from Barack Obama [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=25.12s)]
*  Liz Cheney and many others while the world's richest man launches a legally questionable [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=29.74s)]
*  million dollar sweepstakes to help Trump and later friend of the pod Hawaii Senator Brian Schatz talks to love it about how the race is [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=34.42s)]
*  Looking and the most important things everyone can do to help [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=40.78s)]
*  but first [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=44.06s)]
*  Donald Trump may very well win this race [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=45.980000000000004s)]
*  But with two weeks to go he seems to be losing steam and his mind a Trump advisor [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=47.739999999999995s)]
*  Reportedly told an outlet that their 78 year old candidate has been canceling interviews because he's quote [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=52.86s)]
*  Exhausted a recent Associated Press headline reads a failed mic leaves Donald Trump pacing the stage in silence for nearly 20 minutes in Detroit [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=58.580000000000005s)]
*  This was after he stopped taking questions at a Pennsylvania town hall so he could [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=68.06s)]
*  Rock out to Ave Maria and YMCA for a good half hour or so [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=72.06s)]
*  And whenever Trump does speak his rhetoric lurches from deranged to absurd [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=76.06s)]
*  Here he is with Fox News's Howie Kurtz over the weekend [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=81.06s)]
*  Reaction can you understand why many Americans would view it as a dark and tragic day in our history the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=88.06s)]
*  Crowd I spoke before which you rarely see I have pictures of it to massive, but nobody wants to put him in [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=95.22s)]
*  Was the biggest crowd I've ever spoken to and I've spoken to the biggest crowds. I've never seen that many people [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=100.97999999999999s)]
*  I'd tell you there was a beauty to it and there was a love to it that I've never seen before [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=106.74s)]
*  The enemy within is a pretty ominous phrase if you're talking about other America is accurate [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=112.94s)]
*  I mean, I think it's accurate after our interview Donald Trump flew to Pennsylvania [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=118.06s)]
*  Arnold Palmer's hotel where he discussed the golfers side of his manhood. This is a guy that was all man [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=122.14s)]
*  His man was strong and tough and I refused to say it but when [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=130.66s)]
*  He took showers with the other pros. They came out of there. They said oh my god [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=136.85999999999999s)]
*  That's unbelievable I [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=144.26s)]
*  Had to say it he had to say it [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=146.94s)]
*  Why do you guys think he felt the need to tell the crowd that the late Arnold Palmer was hung like a one would? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=150.14s)]
*  Hmm a lot to talk about in that whole lot to talk about package why [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=158.62s)]
*  First of all, why did how he Kurtz have like a four packs a day voice in the interview and then he sounded normal after what's [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=164.1s)]
*  Going on so yeah, I was this is neither here or there [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=169.1s)]
*  But also how our Kurtz he looked like he was from the 70 [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=172.1s)]
*  It was like a it not in a good or bad way [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=176.44s)]
*  But like his haircut looked like he was like reporting on the oil embargo during the Carter era. It was a deeply weird [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=178.6s)]
*  Interview do you shower together after you golf? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=185.54s)]
*  This was one of my first questions like I'm not a I'm not a golfer [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=188.54s)]
*  But it doesn't seem like a shower afterwards type of sport. Yeah, Ben Dreyfus did some original reporting [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=191.78s)]
*  You guys I was gonna bring it up and then I was like I don't know how to explain Ben's reporting [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=197.14000000000001s)]
*  I don't want to scoop him [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=203.06s)]
*  For this podcast the three of us. I'm not the one that went deeper into whether or not on the Palmer had a giant dick [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=205.82s)]
*  Do you love the dung? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=211.46s)]
*  Did Ben Dreyfus did and seems like he there's a lot of [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=213.3s)]
*  Circumstantial evidence that he does not [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=218.22s)]
*  Necessarily have a big dick had circum sorry [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=221.22s)]
*  Rest in peace [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=224.74s)]
*  Yeah, he's dead. He's dead [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=226.18s)]
*  He's dead in 2016. Yeah, they had a they had to push that lid down on the coffin pretty hard [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=228.18s)]
*  Done to us there's nothing left to talk about except for the dead drivers [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=240.18s)]
*  That golfers junk. This is the point to like we're skipping over how in the interview. He was like, oh, yeah [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=244.74s)]
*  I do think that the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=250.86s)]
*  Violent attack on the Capitol was a day of love and and I do think the Democrats are the enemy within which again [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=252.98000000000002s)]
*  We we predicted this would happen. I think this was like right after [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=259.18s)]
*  Mike Johnson speaking of Johnson's went on meet the press or somewhere and was asked about this and he's like, oh, that's not what he meant [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=263.26s)]
*  That's not what he meant. And sure enough [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=269.94s)]
*  Trump's like this is exactly what I meant punish Adam Schiff [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=272.1s)]
*  What I meant whatever Glenn Young can said whatever Mike Johnson said whatever anyone else is saying to try to defend me that I did [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=274.86s)]
*  This is exactly what I mean. Yeah [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=280.34000000000003s)]
*  It's it's [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=282.73999999999995s)]
*  If Trump were on a unicycle saying I'm gonna imprison my enemies [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=284.34s)]
*  It's still dangerous, even though it's pretty funny that he's on a unicycle [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=288.38s)]
*  Yeah, a deranged clown can be funny, but like, you know, you give him you give him the nukes not so funny [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=291.7s)]
*  In general, how do you guys think the let Trumpy Trump strategy is playing out in the final weeks here net positive net negative? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=298.29999999999995s)]
*  I think on balance. It's a net negative [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=305.29999999999995s)]
*  It's hard to argue that if you were just you know, I have like a disciplined message about the economy for the remainder of campaign that that would probably help him [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=307.3s)]
*  Calling January 6 a day of love [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=315.3s)]
*  Absolutely unequivocally hurts him and repeating it on how it hurts him [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=317.3s)]
*  I think the Arnold Palmer stuff like like there's a lot of young men in particular hear this and just think it's funny [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=321.3s)]
*  They think it's Trump is authentic. He's he's goofy [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=326.3s)]
*  He doesn't care about being politically correct or saying the right thing like the headspinning part about the Trump campaign [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=329.3s)]
*  And you would think that the kind of Mike Pence's of the world or the people who would find this offensive in some way or you know the people getting mad about like a Disney character not being white every few years just like kind of brush this stuff off [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=334.3s)]
*  Look, there's a little bit of politics in him talking about Arnold Palmer having a big dick, which is like he was a real man [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=341.3s)]
*  He was there used to be real men in this country. We celebrate real masculine men [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=346.3s)]
*  And I think that's the thing about the Trump campaign is that he's a real man [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=351.3s)]
*  And he's a real man. He's a real man [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=355.3s)]
*  He was a real man. He was there used to be real men in this country. We celebrate real masculine men [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=357.3s)]
*  And the other side doesn't big swing and dicks big big golfing guys in the shower just yeah [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=364.3s)]
*  Even I'm uncomfortable. He doesn't even need clubs this Arnold Palmer guy [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=372.3s)]
*  He's just out there with a putter fucking buck ass naked golfing [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=378.3s)]
*  Let me tell you about the only poll that matters [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=382.3s)]
*  I just think like look it doesn't matter how look any great golf or tell you [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=388.3s)]
*  You don't need a you can you can have a heavier club. You can have a lighter club. It's about touch. It's about finesse [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=394.3s)]
*  I was waiting for Tommy to make the motion and the beat him to it [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=400.3s)]
*  Hey continue what else are we going to talk about? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=403.3s)]
*  Yeah, I mean look what else were we going to talk about John? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=407.3s)]
*  I think you can say in these final weeks. He is not driving much of a message himself [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=410.3s)]
*  We can separate him from the campaign of course his campaign is running all kinds of ads [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=414.3s)]
*  They are driving a very specific message. He is not driving much of one [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=418.3s)]
*  There was also a time story [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=422.3s)]
*  I don't know if you guys saw this last week about how he's just over the weekend how he's just bored of the economy [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=423.3s)]
*  That's why he's making it all about immigration [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=428.3s)]
*  Like when he does drive a message it's almost exclusively about immigration because he thinks the crowd doesn't get that much [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=430.3s)]
*  The crowd seems bored by which I think is very revealing [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=435.3s)]
*  It's what the crowd likes and it's what he likes he's genuinely passionate about [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=439.3s)]
*  I think like with Trump the medium is the message. I think when he's ranting and raving in front of his biggest fans [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=443.3s)]
*  I think his biggest fans like it when it gets outside of that. I think it it hurts him. I think the kind of [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=449.3s)]
*  goofy [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=456.3s)]
*  rambling [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=458.3s)]
*  Occasionally funny Trump in a podcast setting [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=459.8s)]
*  I think they think it's better for him than then sitting down for mainstream interviews [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=462.3s)]
*  I don't think it's as helpful as their campaign would want it to be because he is so [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=467.3s)]
*  He's just he's just lost a step. So even when he's doing his greatest hits, he's just not bringing the same energy to it [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=472.3s)]
*  He doesn't have many more steps to lose at this point. No, he's almost out of steps. Have you seen these clips of? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=477.3s)]
*  Frankie Valley. No, Frankie Valley has a Vegas show. It's quite believe and basically kind of they kind of wheel out [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=483.3s)]
*  And 90 some odd year old Frankie Valley and he kind of holds the mic up here [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=490.3s)]
*  And then they just play his greatest hits and increasingly that's what Trump is like [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=494.3s)]
*  They kind of get him out there and he's like they used to be tough in this country. I think the Jews might be responsive [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=498.3s)]
*  It's like and it's a little bit like he's a random number generator and just like some part of the Trump kind of the Trump like the Trump [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=504.3s)]
*  Large language model will kind of spit something out. There is there's a bit of you'll be surprised to learn [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=511.3s)]
*  There's a bit of hyperbole that like whenever Trump says something crazy now [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=517.3s)]
*  They try to like put everything in the dementia frame, right? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=521.3s)]
*  He's lost it like the Arnold Palmer thing isn't I don't think not that even though some some people were treating it like that [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=524.3s)]
*  He didn't tell it as well as he would have five years ago [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=529.3s)]
*  Right would have been more charming and funny about it a couple years ago, right? Right [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=531.3s)]
*  But I do think when you combine the like the weird [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=534.3s)]
*  Swing to YMCA and Ave Maria at that town hall with the 20 minutes of walking around in silence while he's waiting for a mic [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=538.3s)]
*  Also, no one could get him a mic in 20 minutes. It's inexplicable. That seems great inexplicable [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=545.3s)]
*  And just like the rallies the rambling the speeches are going on for even longer than usual and they've always been really long [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=549.3s)]
*  It if again if you watch a rally or an interview with a MAGA [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=556.3s)]
*  Friendly outlet which is the only ones he does now [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=561.3s)]
*  I think you will not be impressed with Donald Trump and you're right the podcast ones maybe maybe some people are impressed with that some of [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=564.3s)]
*  The podcast ones some podcast interviews, but I don't know the irony is he only does stuff in his safe space [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=570.3s)]
*  He's on like kind of podcasts with former wrestlers like The Undertaker or kind of Barstool Sports type shows or Fox kind of friendly audiences [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=574.3s)]
*  But he does better when he's pressed a little bit when he did the thing with John McAuliffe wait the editor of Bloomberg News [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=582.3s)]
*  They got into a back-and-forth and Trump was pissed [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=588.3s)]
*  He was punching back and he got aggressive and it made him a little more disciplined and also he was getting cut off by McAuliffe [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=591.3s)]
*  Wait, so we couldn't go on he couldn't do the weave for 35 minutes about some bizarre story that ends with [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=596.3s)]
*  You know the the Golden Bears ass is kind of like the punchline [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=602.3s)]
*  It's like he he gets forced to be a little more focused and like pugilistic [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=605.3s)]
*  And I think when he's on when he's just like alone at a mic he ends up in going on these diatribes that hurt him [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=610.3s)]
*  Yeah, to Trump's comms people did an interview with Semaphore [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=617.3s)]
*  Where they said that the freewheeling Trump is a strategic choice to counteract the Harris campaign's portrayal of him [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=622.3s)]
*  And basically they said that you know if voters see Trump laughing and joking I've never seen him laugh [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=630.3s)]
*  They know he can't possibly be a threat to democracy. Do you do agree with that general idea? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=636.3s)]
*  I agree that that's what they're trying to do and I think there's some validity to it [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=641.3s)]
*  I do think that if the only thing people saw was was Trump laughing it up at a McDonald [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=644.3s)]
*  We're having a funny moment on a podcast with the Yvonne about coke [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=649.3s)]
*  And then what they see on television is Liz Cheney being like he will in democracy [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=652.3s)]
*  I think that that's a that is their fair pushback, but it's not enough [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=656.3s)]
*  It doesn't counteract the other many clips of him actually issuing the threats and doing all of the rest [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=660.3s)]
*  I think we're kind of we're trying to [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=666.3s)]
*  Retrofit reality into a strategy here. Yeah, you know I mean [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=668.3s)]
*  I think the thing that prevents people from thinking that he is some scary authoritarian threat to democracy is his four years in office [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=672.3s)]
*  And the fact that he's like the best-known celebrity on the planet [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=677.3s)]
*  I've shared these interviews help him goofing around being fun and talking about like, you know [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=680.3s)]
*  The guy who took over for Lou Gehrig that all helps Wally Pipp but yeah [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=685.3s)]
*  I mean these guys are trying to make it sound like they have some sort of strategic genius here when it's just their guy doing [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=689.3s)]
*  Trump jazz I thought what was most revealing about that is that they are concerned that he appears as a threat to democracy and [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=694.3s)]
*  They know that that is not that is not politically helpful to him [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=701.3s)]
*  And so that they are trying this in the first place agree with you guys that they're not quite succeeding [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=705.3s)]
*  Well, yeah, I just think that like [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=709.3s)]
*  There are two campaigns running like Donald Trump is a is a is not strategic but he has smart people around him [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=711.3s)]
*  Everything they do isn't gonna be stupid Trump is gonna get wins on the board. He's gonna have effective moments [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=717.3s)]
*  He's gonna have charming moments. I think I think to Tommy's point [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=722.3s)]
*  Yeah, they're trying to turn the fact that they can't really figure out what to do with them at a rally to stop him from [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=725.3s)]
*  Going off script for an hour and a half to try to turn that into an advantage [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=730.3s)]
*  But like there were I was reading that interview was like well, this is pretty smart [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=734.3s)]
*  Now you then remember wait the person they're describing is Donald Trump. No, he's not having this incredibly successful interview on these platforms [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=739.3s)]
*  He's not do delivering what they're claiming he's delivering but there's a part of that interview where they talk about why they prefer going to [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=746.3s)]
*  comedians and others than going to [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=753.3s)]
*  National media that a member of the couple Harris could can't yeah could absolutely say that like less charged and toxic [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=755.3s)]
*  For sure. Conversations and I'm like, well, that's smart. That's right. They're just describing like the reality of the current media landscape. Yeah [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=761.3s)]
*  Trump event that got the most attention this weekend was a the big visit to McDonald's in Pennsylvania [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=768.3s)]
*  Basically the Trump campaign shut down in McDonald's temporarily then picked some people to go through the drive-through [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=774.3s)]
*  so Trump could serve them fries and repeat the [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=781.3s)]
*  Weird lie. He keeps telling that Kamala Harris never worked at McDonald's just no basis in that at all [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=784.3s)]
*  Obviously this drove everyone a little crazy [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=790.3s)]
*  The one CBS reporter did ask Trump a substantive question about the minimum wage. Let's listen [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=792.3s)]
*  So take that as a no maybe yes [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=814.3s)]
*  This whole stunt photo op event, whatever you want to call it [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=817.3s)]
*  Generated quite a bit of attention and blowback. What'd you guys think? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=820.3s)]
*  So you got McDonald's this morning. I did get McDonald's this morning [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=824.3s)]
*  It made me want McDonald's to just cause we're talking about McDonald's [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=829.3s)]
*  Advertising works, branding works. Yeah, I mean it definitely made me want McDonald's more [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=832.3s)]
*  I mean look, I think I think Donald Trump putting on and taking off an apron for the first time in his life at a closed [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=836.3s)]
*  McDonald's while he pretends to serve food to super fans [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=841.3s)]
*  Recruited I suppose by either the campaign or the MAGA owner of this franchise like it's a good picture [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=844.3s)]
*  I think it's a good picture for Donald Trump, but I think we have to like [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=850.3s)]
*  Just like [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=855.3s)]
*  It's so hard to get out of the like [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=856.3s)]
*  He's in an ape like all the kind of like joking and and making it about the picture and not about the fact that like [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=859.3s)]
*  Of course, he doesn't support [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=865.3s)]
*  Of course he doesn't support [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=867.3s)]
*  Raising the minimum wage like Donald Trump would be a disaster for people who work at McDonald's [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=869.3s)]
*  It is a sick fucking joke that he's putting on this apron last time he was president [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=874.3s)]
*  He tried to take away health care of millions of people. Many of them probably worked at McDonald's [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=878.3s)]
*  He will be opposed to their abilities to he is opposed to their ability to unionize [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=882.3s)]
*  He will take away their basic health care protections doesn't want to pay overtime [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=887.3s)]
*  He will cut taxes for billionaires and corporations and make us national sales tax that [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=890.3s)]
*  Regular people will have to pay to cover the difference [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=896.3s)]
*  Like it's just it's the whole the idea that he is this candidate of the working man because he's put on a fucking apron like [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=899.3s)]
*  I think it's a good picture for him [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=906.3s)]
*  But it's like our job to kind of not fall into the trap of debating and being at the McDonald's and like getting back to this like [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=908.3s)]
*  Make the picture a fucking a joke [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=913.3s)]
*  Yeah, it's a really smart event. I mean, yeah, it's really really smarter than do it [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=916.3s)]
*  I don't know why he's obsessed with saying Kamala didn't work it at McDonald's [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=919.3s)]
*  It I guess it just let's her call her inauthentic or something, but yeah, he got to raise that there he I mean like it seemed fun and [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=924.3s)]
*  Normal the whole event. I mean I watched the whole thing [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=933.3s)]
*  It was like 25 26 minutes of him learning to use the frying machine doing it in a suit and tie which looks ridiculous [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=935.9s)]
*  But I don't know it like he's authentically a fan of McDonald's. He eats it [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=942.3s)]
*  He served it to athletes who won national championships. It was obviously a campaign stunt [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=945.9799999999999s)]
*  It was not he didn't really work the fryer like he dunked it once like oh, you know seven remember Obama did the SEIU [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=950.3s)]
*  Waccaday in their shoes event that woman Pauline Beck where he like got up at the crack of dawn and went with her they they made [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=957.6999999999999s)]
*  Breakfast for this man. She was a home health care worker. She made breakfast for the man [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=965.5799999999999s)]
*  He swept up like it was an actual day of work with the SEIU [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=969.3399999999999s)]
*  That was different. This was just a 25 minute stunt, but it it went super viral on social media [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=973.4599999999999s)]
*  Like we're all talking about it. I think it was very smart. Yeah, I think it's I think it's like a net neutral [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=980.26s)]
*  I think there's like a ton of people making fun of it ton of people saying is the best thing ever I [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=985.46s)]
*  Can't imagine it's it's moving many people. I think it I think but look there are [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=991.02s)]
*  Bunch of people who maybe don't read about it, but just see the picture and might be like, oh cool [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=995.98s)]
*  Like it's a vast majority people cool people vast majority people will see a clip on their tik-tok or social media or something [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1001.26s)]
*  There's Donald Trump like Donald's it's kind of fun and different [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1006.14s)]
*  Well, it broke it broke through to like, you know people in my life [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1008.98s)]
*  They don't pay attention much politics and I got some text people just like what the fuck is this? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1011.5s)]
*  There wasn't like cool is like what the fuck is this? Yeah, I just think that like the the the Trump people liking [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1014.98s)]
*  I just think it's a great picture [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1021.18s)]
*  It's a great picture and then people making fun of it because it's like oh, he's like the it's like the worst undercover boss [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1022.18s)]
*  Like all those kind of jokes. I just I like I do think you have to kind of get to like [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1027.82s)]
*  This is somebody pretending to care about working-class people right that's what he will not and like it has to just be very like not [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1032.26s)]
*  Jokey, I think the responses that that drove me [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1038.9s)]
*  most insane are [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1042.02s)]
*  This is just like Dukakis in a tank. It's like no [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1044.14s)]
*  It's not oh that was one of the popular liberal responses on Twitter. Those people are stupid another one [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1047.18s)]
*  Another one was oh by the way, I did some investigative reporting and that McDonald's got fined for health violations [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1052.18s)]
*  That I thought was kind of [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1058.42s)]
*  I'm sorry. I like that. I'm sorry, but McDonald's serves millions of people every day. Nobody gets fucking sick [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1060.9s)]
*  It's amazing. Nobody gets it's amazing. Nobody very rarely very very rarely [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1067.5800000000002s)]
*  Obviously the common hairs campaign would do this but they were showing some of the responses on tik-tok, which I do think [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1072.78s)]
*  We're very funny. It's just some like young kids being like hey grandpa. Just put the fries [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1077.3400000000001s)]
*  Well, that's part of this [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1083.78s)]
*  He was obsessed with the fact that you didn't actually have to touch the fries to get them from the fryer to the container before [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1085.1000000000001s)]
*  The packaging to the packaging I was like, what did you think happened at a restaurant? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1090.26s)]
*  You think people were hand scooping your fries? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1093.98s)]
*  Well, he was doing a very Trump thing [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1096.42s)]
*  Which is just like talking a lot about how this and that the other thing when like the people are just sitting there like waiting [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1098.94s)]
*  The people who've been hand selected by the campaign are just waiting there for their fries in their bag so they can drive offset [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1103.58s)]
*  But then he did a little press conference from the takeout window. So he was taking questions from the press [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1109.3s)]
*  So good. It was good. It was good. It was good. It looked like he looked good. He looked good in the apron [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1114.18s)]
*  Let's just face it. It kind of reminded me of [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1119.02s)]
*  When John Amos was in coming to America and running the McDowell's if he wins the picture of him [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1121.42s)]
*  Smiling and handing out fries is gonna be the picture if he loses the picture of him sitting behind the window like this [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1128.3799999999999s)]
*  Which was another one that would be the picture. I really just be him at like MSG or him in Coachella being like [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1133.66s)]
*  Why are you in California? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1138.76s)]
*  Here's one response to the whole [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1141.3799999999999s)]
*  McDonald's thing from a from a Democrat that I did find compelling. You've got Donald Trump [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1143.74s)]
*  Putting on a little McDonald's costume [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1149.02s)]
*  Because he thinks that's what people do [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1152.62s)]
*  They're not trying to empathize with us they are making fun of us [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1156.54s)]
*  They are making fun of us [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1162.46s)]
*  Donald Trump thinks that people who work at McDonald's are a joke [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1165.3799999999999s)]
*  Elon Musk thinks that dangling money in front of a working person is a cute thing to do when the election of our lives is [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1169.34s)]
*  before us [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1176.9s)]
*  Because that's what [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1178.6999999999998s)]
*  People and billionaires like that do those AOC, of course [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1180.54s)]
*  I like that because I think it turns it into a real [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1184.06s)]
*  Populist argument and sort of exposes the fraud without being like [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1188.02s)]
*  No, I think that's right, which that was my scientific term for what I thought most of the responses were like, yeah [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1192.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, speaking of the world's richest man [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1197.2199999999998s)]
*  Elon's now running a sweepstakes in Pennsylvania where he gives a million dollars a day to someone who signed his super PACS petition [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1199.26s)]
*  Which is supporting just you sign a petition saying you support the first and second amendment [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1206.66s)]
*  The only requirement of course is that you live in Pennsylvania or in one of the other swing states and are registered to vote [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1211.34s)]
*  He's already given away at least two checks [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1217.78s)]
*  But if you google how to sign up all the top results are articles examining whether this is legal Tommy [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1220.3s)]
*  Have you read some of those articles and can you tell us if it is in fact Tommy's read an article is here to tell us [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1225.94s)]
*  what he found [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1230.14s)]
*  Much like Elon I skimmed a couple much like much like Donald Trump learning the front right later for the first time [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1231.06s)]
*  Hey, here we are. Can we find its law? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1236.34s)]
*  so the law specifically says you cannot pay or offer to pay someone to register to vote or to vote and [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1238.18s)]
*  Those who do so can be fined up to ten thousand dollars or get five years in jail or both [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1242.98s)]
*  He's basically we don't want the election turning into a bunch of billionaires paying the most people to vote [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1247.82s)]
*  Some of us don't want some of us don't furthermore the Department of Justice clarifies in its guidelines [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1252.62s)]
*  About prosecuting election offenses that bribes include lottery chances or sweepstakes [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1258.28s)]
*  So making this sort of a sweepstakes for Elon does not get out of jail free card [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1263.68s)]
*  So some election law experts think that this gambit from you on is clearly illegal [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1268.24s)]
*  The must defenders will say no. He's just offering a reward to people who sign his petition [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1274.48s)]
*  He's not encouraging you to register to vote [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1279.3799999999999s)]
*  But as you know to John to be eligible you have to be registered to vote or live in one of these seven swing states [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1281.6s)]
*  And the deadline for entering the contest just happens to be the deadline to register to vote in Michigan or Pennsylvania [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1286.48s)]
*  So it's it's not subtle. It's just it's very clearly just designed in you know [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1292.52s)]
*  Talked about in concert with a bunch of messages about registering or voting early [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1297.92s)]
*  With all election law things you can find experts who say it's illegal. You can find those who say it's not big picture [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1302.56s)]
*  I think you want is betting that no one will enforce it [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1308.52s)]
*  Yeah, that if they do good bet when you look at the history of the FEC Trump friendly judges [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1310.7s)]
*  We'll probably get your back because they're greenlighting all kinds of [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1315.34s)]
*  Campaign spending these days and if Trump gets elected [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1318.86s)]
*  Obviously, he will just never ever prosecute you on us down the list of pardons for him [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1322.1s)]
*  Yeah, so I know Jamie you're asking talks about this in some more detail and today's what a day newsletter [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1327.48s)]
*  So check that out [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1332.3s)]
*  But you know, I think the bigger picture is like what are the politics of this? Well people think it's gross. I kind of do [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1332.98s)]
*  Gross or just like oh you got to you got to pay people to vote for Trump. That's what I'm saying [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1339.6999999999998s)]
*  It does not I think Americans might inherently be offended by paying people off to vote [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1345.62s)]
*  That's why I read that's actually the part about the AOC clip that I liked even more than the McDonald's part is just like [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1350.46s)]
*  Oh this billionaire is gonna dangle a million dollars in front of the plebes to see if you'll vote for you know [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1354.9399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. If I were I'll just say that if I were a registered voter in any of the swing states that were eligible [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1360.28s)]
*  I would of course sign this pledge everybody listening if you feel like you could sign this pledge. I would consider doing it because [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1366.98s)]
*  You can do a lot more with a million dollars, you know must can and [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1373.5s)]
*  Yeah, no the the I'll do what honestly reminded me of is there's like old footage and photographs of like [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1376.9399999999998s)]
*  Belgian and British [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1384.1399999999999s)]
*  Colonists like throwing coins and candies at the children in their colonies [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1386.82s)]
*  And that's what Elon going out there and like dangling in money in front of people like genuinely reminded me of yeah, it's I [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1391.6s)]
*  Don't think it's very cute [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1398.94s)]
*  I also don't think it's very effective just from a like yeah [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1400.66s)]
*  You can sign the if you're a registered voter or you registered to vote this still doesn't mean you're gonna go vote [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1403.62s)]
*  No, and this suggestion is like, okay. Well, it's a First Amendment Second Amendment petition [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1408.06s)]
*  So you're only gonna get Republicans and then you're gonna have their contact info and then you know [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1412.3799999999999s)]
*  Elon can get them with messaging and actually turn them out [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1415.68s)]
*  No, you're just having a bunch of people who want money [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1418.7s)]
*  So they'll pretend to care about the First and Second Amendment and sign your dumb little petition [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1420.78s)]
*  And again, you don't have to take our to you don't take our word for it a lot of they interviewed some Trump campaign officials [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1424.8999999999999s)]
*  About this who of course all in background about Elon and the ground game and everything and to a person they were all just like [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1429.86s)]
*  Yeah, he's got his own thing. We've got our other things and he's just doing it where we're happy to have him out here [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1435.58s)]
*  But sounds like they but this is like I feel like this is the honor of Palmer's dick of [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1440.34s)]
*  The Elon shit, which is like no, it's not the million dollar pledge. It'll make sense in a second. It's the [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1446.86s)]
*  Tens of millions doing the weave I'm doing the baby. I've been weaving I listen [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1451.78s)]
*  Do you think Trump invented the weed? [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1457.62s)]
*  Weave in dicks forever. Yeah hundred [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1460.4599999999998s)]
*  It's the hundreds of millions of dollars being dropped on the race by Elon by the crypto bros buying ads [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1462.62s)]
*  Like this really is now like in the homestretch [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1467.82s)]
*  There are these like there's like the there's the Kamala Harris campaign [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1470.1399999999999s)]
*  And then there's the kind of twisted bizarro evil version, right? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1473.74s)]
*  Like the Kamala Harris campaign has raised a billion dollars Trump has Elon's money and all of this crypto money and all this billionaire money [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1477.58s)]
*  From Ken Griffin and others. There's a real field organization. There's their paid-for field organization, which I really hope is is [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1483.62s)]
*  working about as well as [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1491.42s)]
*  You would expect an Elon turned on field our organization in the last weeks of this campaign [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1494.1s)]
*  then you have a turn out the vote operation versus a [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1498.78s)]
*  Under mine and scare the vote operation like there are these two things sitting side by side and Elon is a big part of that [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1501.74s)]
*  Last thing before we get to Kamala Harris [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1507.86s)]
*  We mentioned already the Democrats have different theories of the case about how to attack Trump and company [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1510.86s)]
*  We haven't talked about our former boss who is Barack Obama who's been having a really good time on the campaign trail [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1515.98s)]
*  Just tearing into Trump. Let's listen to how he did it recently you you would be worried [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1523.9s)]
*  You you would be worried if your grandpa started acting like this [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1529.7s)]
*  You would I [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1535.94s)]
*  Mean, yeah, right? [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1537.74s)]
*  You'd like call up your brother your cousin or something. Be like, hey, have you seen grandpa lately? [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1539.66s)]
*  What we gonna do [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1545.5400000000002s)]
*  But this is coming from somebody who wants unchecked power [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1548.5400000000002s)]
*  Once the most powerful office on earth [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1553.8200000000002s)]
*  With the nuclear codes and all that [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1557.06s)]
*  now [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1560.22s)]
*  The point is we don't we we do not need to see what an older [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1562.46s)]
*  Lunier Donald Trump looks like with no guardrails [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1568.74s)]
*  America's ready to turn the page [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1573.5s)]
*  Speaking of people who like dick jokes. Yeah speeches [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1575.98s)]
*  Yeah, that's basically another version of the [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1579.7s)]
*  Unserious [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1583.6599999999999s)]
*  Unserious man serious consequences that Kamala Harris has used. I don't know. I like it [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1584.82s)]
*  Yeah, I think threats of democracy can sound a little vague and hard to understand in practice [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1588.78s)]
*  I think don't give kooky grandpa the nukes like that's that's not complicated. Yeah [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1592.78s)]
*  Yes, I think that that was great and it was much it was actually much more. Um, I think [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1598.1799999999998s)]
*  Matt like there's it's really just like Donald Trump would be a mad king [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1603.1399999999999s)]
*  Sometimes we talk more about the mad sometimes talk more about the king and like that was I think more mad focus [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1606.22s)]
*  But you saw a little little of the kind of the the deceptive democracy rhetoric with the phrase guardrails with no guardrails [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1610.48s)]
*  It's very like kind of threat to democracy [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1616.72s)]
*  It's it's like the word guardrails just because it you can conjure up a picture at least as opposed to some of these words that [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1618.44s)]
*  That the democracy defenders use. Yeah, no, no one knows what a guardrail [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1624.76s)]
*  No, I I agree with that [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1628.58s)]
*  But I think like the argument that like Donald Trump is just a like he's losing it [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1630.16s)]
*  You just don't want somebody who's losing as president [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1633.72s)]
*  You don't really need the other party argument that like oh he Mike Pence doesn't support him [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1635.88s)]
*  He's gonna have a different group of people around that is a different argument. I thought it was like I think that's I think that second part [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1639.88s)]
*  Is a very effective argument. I agree. I think the big obstacle here the big hurdle [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1645.3600000000001s)]
*  You've got to overcome is what Tommy pointed out, which is everyone's like, oh, yeah [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1649.44s)]

*  There are no requirements for baby food companies to test their products for chemical contaminants [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1779.96s)]

*  Disrupting the baby food industry again with radical transparency [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1798.2s)]
*  Little spoon is the first and only baby food brand in the u.s. To set strict limits for more than 500 toxins and contaminants [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1801.48s)]

*  We're recording this on Monday afternoon West Coast time and today alone Kamala Harris did an event near Philly a [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1880.08s)]
*  Conversation with Liz Cheney hosted by her pal Sarah Longwell and bulwark [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1885.76s)]
*  She's also in the Detroit suburbs and the Milwaukee suburbs. Here's a sampling of the message. She's driving in those places [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1889.42s)]
*  This is from her event in Detroit and that was moderated by Maria Shriver. Madam vice president [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1895.56s)]
*  You know everybody I talked to says, you know, I have to turn off the news. I can't read anything. I'm meditating [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1900.88s)]
*  I'm doing yoga. I'm doing I'm so anxious. I just don't even know I'm eating gummies all kinds of things, you know [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1905.64s)]
*  What are you doing? What are you doing? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1912.24s)]
*  Eating gummies [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1915.2s)]
*  I've said many times I do [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1917.28s)]
*  Donald Trump to be an unserious man [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1919.28s)]
*  But the consequences of him ever being in the White House again are brutally serious [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1922.52s)]
*  And and take it from the people who know him best [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1928.78s)]
*  His former chief of staff [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1932.8400000000001s)]
*  When he was president two former defense secretaries his national security advisor and of course his vice president [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1935.28s)]
*  Who have all in one way or another use the word that he is unfit to be president again and is dangerous [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1943.72s)]
*  And that illustrates the challenge from the other side. She goes from gummies [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1951.68s)]
*  Laughing gummies to he's a dangerous threat. It's so funny that just like I'm sorry [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1956.3200000000002s)]
*  But like Shriver just talking about what people are doing to deal with their stress just sounded so fucking rich [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1961.28s)]
*  So rich is what it was [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1966.68s)]
*  What you got so the headline in the Times from Monday mornings, Pennsylvania event was Cheney with Harris tells anti-abortion women [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1969.52s)]
*  It's okay to back her just wild times [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1976.68s)]
*  What's your take on what the strategy was behind? [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1980.0800000000002s)]
*  These Cheney events. So I mean the there's a Times analysis that talked about who both campaigns think are the [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1982.8400000000001s)]
*  Persuadable voters left out there and the Harris campaign thinks about 10% of voters in swing states are still winnable in a big chunk [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1988.52s)]
*  Of those voters are Republican women who dislike Trump [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1994.76s)]
*  But need to hear more from her on the border and the economy to close the deal and these events are [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=1998.48s)]
*  laser focused on those women and they also I think generally push back on the Trump criticism Kamala Harris as like a [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2003.8799999999999s)]
*  What she's a Marxist communist fascist at this point, you know [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2010.76s)]
*  Whatever he's calling her some sort of extreme radical when you see her up there with Maria Shriver or Liz Cheney. I think that really rebuts [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2014.52s)]
*  Those [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2021.8400000000001s)]
*  criticisms in a pretty strong way I [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2023.0s)]
*  Was I was watching the Pennsylvania one and when Kamala Harris got a question about abortion she started giving her answer [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2024.72s)]
*  I was watching was Cheney and I'm like, well, this is awkward because it's like usually they're just talking about things [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2030.32s)]
*  They agree on that and then Cheney [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2035.08s)]
*  Asked to step in and then gave that answer abortion and it just made me think [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2038.52s)]
*  You know, there's been some criticism from some corners of the internet on the left that like oh Kamala Harris is out there with the Cheneys [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2042.52s)]
*  And now she's blowing the whole thing because you but like not only has Kamala Harris not [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2049.28s)]
*  Moderated any positions or given up anything in order to get the support of Liz Cheney. There's Liz Cheney saying oh by the way [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2054.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm against abortion, but I'm here because I think this is so important [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2061.6400000000003s)]
*  And by the way, these abortion bans have gone way too far [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2066.6800000000003s)]
*  She was talking about how in Texas Ken Pax and the Attorney General is suing to get women's private medical records because he wants [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2069.32s)]
*  To see if they've traveled over state lines to get an abortion and Liz Cheney is like we can't do this anymore [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2076.48s)]
*  So I thought it was like I thought it's really effective Liz Cheney [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2080.84s)]
*  I think is an incredible spokesperson in that setting it is [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2083.64s)]
*  Like she's doing the thing we've been asking everyone to do and it speaks to both [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2087.4s)]
*  What it clearly took for her to do this and also the cowardice of so many others that she is basically [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2092.48s)]
*  Alone up there, but like that was a great event. It's just a great event and it's incredibly persuasive [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2097.52s)]
*  I don't see Dick Cheney out there ever but yes Liz Cheney is a very good spokesperson [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2102.54s)]
*  I don't think he'd be useful many places [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2106.42s)]
*  No [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2108.2200000000003s)]
*  And she's I think she's like shown herself to be a principled person from [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2108.46s)]
*  Impeachment until now and I think people give her the benefit of doubt [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2111.78s)]
*  You know a lot of the other stuff and it again it just sends the message like yeah, we don't agree [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2114.62s)]
*  Yeah, I'm conservative but like there's just bigger things at stake right now [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2118.54s)]
*  I want to talk a little bit more that New York Times story the Tommy brought up [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2121.18s)]
*  How about how both campaigns are identifying and thinking about undecided voters? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2125.98s)]
*  Another group of undecided voters that both the Trump and Harris campaigns are targeting are [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2129.9799999999996s)]
*  disproportionately younger and less white [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2136.2599999999998s)]
*  And they talk about that in the piece one example a 22 year old in Arizona [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2139.06s)]
*  They have him in the Times piece who said he doesn't care who wins and that he only registered to vote because his mom made him [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2143.9799999999996s)]
*  But he will vote for Harris if someone brings a ballot to his front door [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2150.14s)]
*  I mean, I hope I hope that Harris campaign gets his address [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2154.7799999999997s)]
*  That's why you have a field program his name his name's in the piece give him a call find his address send him a ballot [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2157.94s)]
*  How long did the Times interview take my man? [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2163.6200000000003s)]
*  You care a little bit you care enough to spend a time the whole interview talking about it. That's a good point [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2167.5800000000004s)]
*  It's a fair point how much you don't care [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2172.1400000000003s)]
*  Trump campaign thinks that about 5% of voters. Yeah are undecided and like you said [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2174.2200000000003s)]
*  It's funny because we're gonna talk about pluffs interviewing a little bit with John Hyman, but pluff said there's about 4% [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2178.7400000000002s)]
*  But I think what you mentioned from the times pieces the Harris campaign thinks that up to 10% are [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2183.82s)]
*  Persuadable and the reason I think it's bigger is because of those Republican women or right-leaning independent women [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2188.82s)]
*  Who just do not like Trump but are not yet sold on Harris? [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2196.46s)]
*  Yeah [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2201.1400000000003s)]
*  it's hard to it's hard to tell just sort of how people slice and dice the numbers between like the group of voters that [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2201.44s)]
*  Either won't vote or almost certainly would vote for Trump the group people that won't vote are almost [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2206.46s)]
*  Certainly are probably with over Kamala and then the group of people that are truly [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2210.6s)]
*  Going to voter or may or may not vote but are actually undecided [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2213.84s)]
*  Yeah, the Times found they think that 3.7 percent of voters in battleground states are undecided which is only 1.2 million people [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2216.96s)]
*  So 1.2 million truly undecideds, but I think you're right these numbers these percentages swell when you're talking about [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2224.1800000000003s)]
*  Not voting to voting or you know people might be persuaded to stay home basically anything else you guys found notable in that story [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2230.6800000000003s)]
*  the refrain of how people want more information and then [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2239.1600000000003s)]
*  How hard it is to get that that people the readily available? [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2243.28s)]
*  Information and even that when Kamala Harris says this huge round of press how little it ultimately gets to those voters [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2247.4s)]
*  There's one piece that like 20 times no single program reach more than one in three of those undecided voters [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2252.96s)]
*  They're just like I was surprised by that the other direction [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2257.64s)]
*  Yeah [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2260.44s)]
*  so it says it the in the Times because it said internal surveys the [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2260.6s)]
*  Harris campaign internal surveys showed that two-thirds of undecided voters in the battleground states had consumed at least some of Kamala's [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2264.4399999999996s)]
*  Interviews during her big media blitz week or two weeks [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2271.24s)]
*  But no single program reached more than one in three of those undecided voters [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2274.6s)]
*  But two-thirds of undecideds just seeing something that shocked me that I just like big daddy gang [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2279.08s)]
*  I guess I just like what does it mean for I just like how hard it is like these are all people saying they want more [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2284.3999999999996s)]
*  Information she's doing a full-court press across every kind of media and like maybe [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2289.36s)]
*  Maybe one in three is getting some clip of one thing. It's just like it just remind just like the [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2295.04s)]
*  Anyway, I thought we were gonna go with the more information complaint is the woman that they interviewed at the end of the piece [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2302.2400000000002s)]
*  She's like a 40-something [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2309.32s)]
*  Republican for women in Pennsylvania and she doesn't like Trump but she's like worried about the economy [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2311.56s)]
*  You know, I've heard a little bit about Conway Harris's plans [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2316.08s)]
*  But on housing she wants to give like first-time homebuyers [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2318.2s)]
*  $25,000 credit on their down payment and I just don't want to be given more money and no one's talking about the supply of [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2321.88s)]
*  Housing and I was like, uh, she wants to build three million more [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2327.24s)]
*  But she also said she might write in our kid jr. As a protest at the same woman. Yeah, that was [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2330.08s)]
*  It's tough [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2334.88s)]
*  And and we love them and we love them and we don't want to say anything other than we love them [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2336.88s)]
*  I just love their whole energy that they're bringing to this [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2341.2s)]
*  I also found it interesting that of the more than hundred clips during her media blitz that the Harris campaign tested for their effectiveness [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2343.52s)]
*  Increasing her support her her proposal [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2349.92s)]
*  About providing home care for adding home care coverage to Medicare coverage for seniors ranked at the top [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2353.32s)]
*  This is interesting because again, who's gonna talk about that on shows like ours the other and cable and everywhere else [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2359.0s)]
*  You know, I mean we mentioned it but like it's not it's not gonna get people get pundits excited, but it moves folks [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2366.28s)]
*  Yeah, thank you will care about also thought the Trump campaign found that up for grabs voters were six times more likely than other [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2371.04s)]
*  Battleground voters to be motivated by their views of the war in Gaza didn't really stay in which direction [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2376.36s)]
*  I found that interesting too, especially since the Harris campaign doesn't seem to see that [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2381.32s)]
*  I like there so there was that fact and the other point that the other the other faction of the Trump campaign is that [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2386.36s)]
*  The undecided are more likely to work two jobs on average and they earn [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2391.92s)]
*  15,000 less per household than the battleground voters who have made up their minds and I saw those two facts side by side [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2395.52s)]
*  And I was like I'm trying to make sense of this [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2400.44s)]
*  So undecided voters are working two jobs and really struggling but also more motivated by [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2402.52s)]
*  The Middle East than other [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2409.6s)]
*  Voters and I I wondered if some of that was a little bit of them wish casting and kind of putting a little something [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2411.48s)]
*  Out there. I think it's also who the the pool is that you're talking about if these voters are younger [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2417.08s)]
*  You're just gonna get more of them that care about Gaza than older voters [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2424.2400000000002s)]
*  I think yeah [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2430.0s)]
*  the other sort of last thing I noticed on this was [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2431.12s)]
*  They talked about how Kamala Harris bought ads on daytime Fox because more women are watching Fox [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2433.84s)]
*  During the day than at night when it's more opinion focused [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2439.08s)]
*  I thought that was then the Washington Post had a bunch of swing state polls out today [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2441.4s)]
*  Where they asked people about their main news sources and they found that about a quarter of those who consider Fox a main source of news [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2444.52s)]
*  said they're considering voting for a Kamala Harris with about one in six saying they have already or [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2451.0s)]
*  Definitely plan to vote for her which is a very surprising fact [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2456.4s)]
*  I thought I well on the last pod we did I can't remember when with Dan [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2459.56s)]
*  I have looked at the New York Times the latest New York Times poll and that showed that [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2464.48s)]
*  Ten percent of undecided voters say that Fox was a news source for them. Yeah, but then I wonder like, okay [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2468.24s)]
*  So then the kind of person answering these polls is the kind of person consuming this news and I don't know [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2473.6s)]
*  I maybe think like well, does that tell you more about the poll than it does about the voters? [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2478.84s)]
*  Well, we also got more insight into how the Harris campaign is thinking about this extremely close race [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2483.7599999999998s)]
*  From David Plouffe in a new interview with pucks John Heilman. Here's some of that. This race is just dead even and [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2489.0s)]
*  Listen, you know, I think the Trump campaign [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2496.2799999999997s)]
*  Would admit that too and you can tell based on their activity and what they're saying [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2498.8399999999997s)]
*  I guess my confidence is more based on looking at who the undecided voters are [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2503.6s)]
*  And you know data these days is incredibly rich and sophisticated every battleground state of the seven [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2508.9599999999996s)]
*  There's at least four percent who are still trying to decide who to vote for then the early voting data we're seeing so far [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2514.72s)]
*  there's no suggestion that they are turning out a bunch of [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2520.7599999999998s)]
*  Irregular voters does your data in the seven battleground states show any sign that Trump has momentum and that he's tight [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2525.6s)]
*  Whether when you say I get that that that it's [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2532.6s)]
*  Mathematically statistically this is gonna be a toss-up race within the margin of error in all seven, but you could see [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2535.48s)]
*  There is momentum in that's coming through in your data that's not noise [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2541.72s)]
*  Does the Trump campaign have any of that in any of the seven battleground states? No, I [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2544.8799999999997s)]
*  Would listen to an interview with David Plouffe. Maybe he should just give like a five minutes every night [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2549.2s)]
*  Yeah from now until if it in the next two weeks when that be nice for sure because it's not like I call this [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2554.52s)]
*  It's prestige. Hopium [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2560.56s)]
*  It's not like everything's gonna be fine kind of thing but it is because because at the end he's still like yeah [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2563.3199999999997s)]
*  We could lose this race. It's very close. It's tied, right? [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2569.32s)]
*  But it is it's just a lot of great insight from pluff [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2571.6000000000004s)]
*  I I highly recommend you listen to it and pluff if you have any more stuff to say [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2574.32s)]
*  We'll do that five minutes here or the calm app by the way, but uh, yeah [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2578.32s)]
*  it's also like there's a point point of the interview where [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2583.56s)]
*  Heilman asked them like well, what do you say to people looking at the the swinging of the the Nate Silver average? [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2587.7200000000003s)]
*  He's like, I don't I wouldn't look at that. I don't look at that and it's like it's based on public polls [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2594.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, they just don't look he won't look at any public polls these things they're junk but that but I just that like [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2598.08s)]
*  That they're based on public polls and if the Nate Silver model says it's 52 48 versus 48 52 [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2604.98s)]
*  It still means that in 48 times out of 100 Kamala wins or 48 out of time 48 times out of 100 Trump wins [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2611.94s)]
*  Like these little changes don't matter and it was like what pluff said to Dan a couple days ago [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2617.04s)]
*  Very similar what he's saying here, which is basically like these ebbs and flows in the public polling [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2621.96s)]
*  They're causing these like epic swings and vibe shift and text to me are like they're just not real. They're just not real [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2625.44s)]
*  Yeah [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2632.36s)]
*  I mean I think some of the another important point he made was that Trump is just so dependent on turning out these first time or [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2632.88s)]
*  irregular voters [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2638.6s)]
*  And that's a real risk and he repeated his observation. They're not seeing incels marauding to early vote locations [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2640.04s)]
*  So that was good to hear and again, we talked a lot about how Democrats are struggling to win over male voters [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2646.2400000000002s)]
*  But pluff talked about Trump's massive disadvantage when it comes to the women [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2652.4s)]
*  Especially college-educated women and women under 29 and then again for all the talk about shifts in the Latino vote [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2655.48s)]
*  He made the point that a lot of the numbers are coming from these national polls where you're sampling like 300 400 total people [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2661.38s)]
*  And you know, there are gonna be states like Florida where Trump is gonna win overwhelmingly and it's gonna win with Latino voters and that's [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2669.2400000000002s)]
*  Gonna skew what sort of the aggregate picture looks like but really the Harris campaign is concerned about Arizona and Nevada and parts of Pennsylvania [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2676.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I also thought just in general. He said look Trump's gonna get [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2684.84s)]
*  48 48 point five percent of the vote and [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2690.1600000000003s)]
*  That's probably higher than he got even in 2020 [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2693.6000000000004s)]
*  he's like and that's just a fact that we all gonna have to live with and [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2696.0800000000004s)]
*  he thinks that any tightening that we have seen in the polls lately is just polls that had Trump at [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2698.84s)]
*  43 44 45 and then finally he's getting his vote share which he's gonna end up getting and she's you know sitting at 49 [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2705.24s)]
*  In a lot of these and so I think when you know, he keeps he has said before to Dan to [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2713.48s)]
*  48 48 or 48 47 in like all these swing states and [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2718.44s)]
*  he said that the reason that he has confidence that he's cautiously confident is what he said is that the [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2722.3199999999997s)]
*  he thinks that they have a higher ceiling the Kamala Harris has a higher ceiling than Trump does and [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2728.92s)]
*  That the remaining voters who are undecided look more like Harris voters than Trump voters [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2733.88s)]
*  But that said they still have to get those voters out [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2740.04s)]
*  They still have some persuasion to do and he also said that he thinks door knocking and and canvassing and like [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2742.84s)]
*  Going out there is gonna be more important this year this election than it has been almost any other election [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2749.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and partly because the campaign started later [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2754.52s)]
*  There are people that truly are undecided and want more information and it may be somebody coming to their door to give it to them [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2757.4s)]
*  Like that like that kid in Arizona who needs the ballot dropped off at his door [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2762.38s)]
*  How are you guys feeling? [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2766.7000000000003s)]
*  terrible [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2768.46s)]
*  Yeah, I don't feel [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2770.1800000000003s)]
*  Great. I just I went into the CVS and I got a two-for-one [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2772.3s)]
*  Peps it so that I could have one in my house and one of my car [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2776.94s)]
*  Which is I think maybe just being 42. I think that I think we were up by five [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2780.94s)]
*  I still probably would need it, but I can't be sure. I can't be sure I feel fairly Zen [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2784.62s)]
*  You know as a little angsty over the weekend I did go to [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2790.68s)]
*  children's birthday party and was talking to one of the parents and of course you have to you know, you do the pod wherever you go and [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2794.6s)]
*  And I was I was giving what I thought was just a pretty [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2800.3599999999997s)]
*  Not optimistic or pessimistic neutral analysis of where the race stands and I finished up and then she walked back up to me ten [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2803.44s)]
*  Seconds later. She goes you made me feel awful. This is scary. I'm like, yeah we can loot like it's not no one should think that [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2809.96s)]
*  I think there was I think there was some a lot of good feelings as there should have been [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2817.2799999999997s)]
*  After the switch after the convention after the debate [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2821.08s)]
*  I know that I thought that there was a possibility if she did well in the debate [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2823.72s)]
*  Maybe she'd open a little bit of lead that would be stable and that would be that [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2826.9599999999996s)]
*  It's just it's gonna be a tight race what feels bad is that this piece of shit is even in the running? [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2829.7599999999998s)]
*  Yes, that will never not be the case [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2834.0s)]
*  But it's also like I just don't want us to do the same thing [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2836.3999999999996s)]
*  We've done did in 2016 like who gives a shit how you feel over the next two weeks. I'm sorry Maria Shriver [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2839.2799999999997s)]
*  Fucking matters. No, but it doesn't matter how no, I thank you and thank you for asking [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2845.44s)]
*  I'm checking with people you love like like, oh, what are you doing to deal with all stress the stress over the next two weeks? [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2849.2400000000002s)]
*  Who cares? Well fucking cares and I know you did what you guys have done [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2854.64s)]
*  Yeah, and you felt the same thing like I ended up doing a kickoff call for the [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2859.16s)]
*  Wisconsin Democrats their organizers the whole staff [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2864.44s)]
*  Sunday night and after a weekend of feeling a little angsty about everything [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2867.6s)]
*  I finished that call and I heard all the stories about the doors they knocked on and the voters they talked to people [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2871.36s)]
*  And I was just listening [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2876.0s)]
*  I was like listening on the call after I like talked to them for a couple of minutes and I stayed on for the whole [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2877.7200000000003s)]
*  Half hour and I'm like this I walked out of that column like this was better than any good poll [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2882.1200000000003s)]
*  I just felt so great. Now is that feeling? [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2886.52s)]
*  Valid because it's all anecdotal who knows maybe not but it felt good [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2889.84s)]
*  Well, that was a point that like you'll hear with shots where he was talking about that moment where Como says [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2893.4s)]
*  Oh, you're at the wrong value [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2897.2400000000002s)]
*  The smaller one down the street and he said that like when he was first running there were no polls running a state legislature [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2898.3199999999997s)]
*  Race in Hawaii and that like you did Matt the vibes did matter [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2903.58s)]
*  They mattered both because they represented how things would go [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2906.3999999999996s)]
*  But also vibes will help you get things to where you need them to go [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2909.56s)]
*  And so like a lot less angsting like are we gonna be okay text? [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2913.12s)]
*  It is not known it will not be known until a few days after the election [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2917.24s)]
*  Everybody's just gonna go to vote save America and do the shift you haven't done yet [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2920.56s)]
*  Well who needs polls though when we now have actual votes coming in that we can analyze before they've even been counted [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2924.2s)]
*  That's right. More than 15 million people have already voted early [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2931.0s)]
*  Which means tea leaves are being read and lessons are not being learned [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2935.12s)]
*  And either of you guys want to remind folks what the early vote can and can't tell us [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2940.08s)]
*  Yeah, I can't tell us anything [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2945.4s)]
*  It can't tell you anything because this [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2947.84s)]
*  early voting it has got [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2951.44s)]
*  2020 2022 2024 each of these elections like the the pandemic [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2954.44s)]
*  post-pandemic the rise of vote by mail and early voting a Republican candidate who has [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2961.68s)]
*  Has come out against vote by mail and tried to push people towards Election Day like the influence of all of this means [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2967.04s)]
*  We just don't know what the vote share will be on Election Day and an election that will be decided by a point or two if [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2973.12s)]
*  We're lucky that will really matter [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2977.92s)]
*  The margins are what matters and there's no way to know the margins like maybe there's value to it for a campaign and very [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2980.56s)]
*  Specific kind of targeting and information but for us out here in the world not particularly useful [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2986.28s)]
*  Yeah, unless you're doing very sophisticated like regression analysis based on blah blah blah math math like don't read this stuff [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2990.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's useless. Yeah, so everyone knows because you know, we heard pluff talking about [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=2998.12s)]
*  They feel good about the incels not showing up at the polls [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3003.92s)]
*  Maybe thinking like the ballots aren't coming in sticky [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3006.8799999999997s)]
*  So wow, this is a real setting a real record on this episode good episode [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3011.24s)]
*  What? [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3016.48s)]
*  What they what the early vote can tell you and again it can really tell campaigns this who are who have so much [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3017.48s)]
*  Sophisticated data and are calling thousands of people a night and ground game and all that kind of stuff [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3022.9599999999996s)]
*  You know, they can tell you party [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3027.8399999999997s)]
*  Demographic information vote history. I think that's what plops referring to so [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3030.56s)]
*  In some states, you know [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3034.6s)]
*  if the voter who's voted early has voted a lot before or are one of those low propensity voters and then you can see if [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3036.0s)]
*  The low propensity voter looks like a Harris voter or looks like a Trump voter [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3042.2799999999997s)]
*  so you can make some educated guesses if you're the campaign and [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3045.16s)]
*  That only helps you in so far as not knowing if you're gonna win but knowing okay [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3048.64s)]
*  We've got these voters, but we still need to go after these voters because they haven't early voted yet [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3053.3599999999997s)]
*  And so now we need to go make sure that they send their ballots in like that's what early vote is good for in a campaign [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3057.3999999999996s)]
*  It's not good for telling you like oh, yeah [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3063.2s)]
*  Now we're gonna win because even if you ask campaign with sophisticated data analysis about what the early vote shown [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3065.3199999999997s)]
*  They'll say well, we're a little down, but hopefully on election day everything, you know [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3070.64s)]
*  We're gonna chase all those ballots that didn't come in yet. That's what they'll say [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3074.3599999999997s)]
*  By the way, that's not like a false or or that's not a key [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3077.04s)]
*  That's not a necessary false [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3080.2799999999997s)]
*  Hope right like there have been elections where the early vote people took that to predict a Democratic lean that wasn't there in times [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3081.3599999999997s)]
*  Where I used to take a Republican lean that wasn't there like it's just it's not been predictive [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3086.3999999999996s)]
*  There were people in 2016 looking at the early vote predicting landslide Hillary Clinton victories and they could not have possibly been more wrong [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3090.04s)]
*  Yeah, just not make that mistake again any and and you know because again the behavior the voting behavior has changed so much [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3096.96s)]
*  That even in I remember in 2022 the early vote was sort of bad for Democrats [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3103.92s)]
*  quote unquote bad compared to [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3109.92s)]
*  2020 because everyone was using the 2020 comparison and it turned out that was all wrong because [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3112.04s)]
*  People's behavior started changing we will find out just after the election [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3117.48s)]
*  What we learned about early vote and what we learned about the polling this cycle [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3121.92s)]
*  But there's really there take those lessons and and for next election day over apply them [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3125.26s)]
*  Fight the last war yet again the last war is common to the incels [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3130.2000000000003s)]
*  That's for the vol cells [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3138.7200000000003s)]

*  How are you feeling how you feeling about the stay of the race here, uh, look I [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3442.72s)]
*  I have to say it i'll say it this way [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3446.3199999999997s)]
*  We are slightly ahead [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3450.0s)]
*  And if we do everything we're supposed to do we will win and if we do anything we're not supposed to do we will not [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3452.0s)]
*  Um, so I like our chances [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3459.12s)]
*  But that but we really do have to execute in the next couple of weeks now combo the good news, right? [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3461.68s)]
*  Is that our candidate is executing at a super super high level? [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3466.7999999999997s)]
*  And that's not just important from the standpoint of vote getting it also [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3471.84s)]
*  Gives a lot of confidence to the grassroots out there the people are giving money the people are knocking on doors [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3476.5600000000004s)]
*  When you see your candidate kicking ass you kind of want to you know, follow that example [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3481.6000000000004s)]
*  So I think it's uh, it's as important that she sort of lead us [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3486.1600000000003s)]
*  Um that that as it is that she sort of demonstrate that she's the right person to be [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3490.88s)]
*  Uh, the next president of the united states. So i'm feeling pretty confident but definitely not overconfident and [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3495.76s)]
*  You know, there's an old line in an old movie. I don't trust happiness. So i'm going to be scared all the way through [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3501.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's um [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3507.36s)]
*  Sounds jewish. Uh, so [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3508.96s)]
*  Uh, let's talk about what we what we need to do. I was talking about this with tim miller and he used a sports analogy [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3511.44s)]
*  Which is it's now about uh, it's now about the 12th man. It's now about the crowd [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3517.1200000000003s)]
*  And what the crowd can do? Um [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3522.32s)]
*  Uh, but on this but but on the other hand, you know, we have to do everything right and we can't do everything anything [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3524.88s)]
*  Wrong in order to win. Why does that logic not apply to donald trump? Well, listen, I don't know [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3531.12s)]
*  And maybe it does right maybe some of these hiccups maybe the fact that he's starting to turn down [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3538.24s)]
*  media opportunities maybe maybe the [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3544.8s)]
*  Fact that he's not even campaigning in swing states but going to california new york like all of that could end up being [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3547.6s)]
*  In retrospect the reason he loses all we can control though [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3554.08s)]
*  Is what we're up to and we have to execute as well as we possibly can because of the electoral college [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3557.84s)]
*  Um, if this were a popular vote thing, I think i'd feel a little more confident [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3564.56s)]
*  But I do feel confident and it's a weird thing right the polling is fine, but not, you know dispositive [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3568.2400000000002s)]
*  But I will tell you last night [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3573.92s)]
*  Um when when the vice president was interrupted by some hecklers and she said [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3576.2400000000002s)]
*  Oh, no, you must be you must be at the wrong rally. There's a smaller one down the street [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3581.6s)]
*  It was such a small thing and yet it was such a big thing [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3587.1200000000003s)]
*  You only do that if you have a spring in your step and I have very look [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3589.6800000000003s)]
*  You know, I started in politics in in state legislative races where we had no money for polling [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3594.48s)]
*  And so it was a lot about body language and organization and kind of the vibes on the ground and we could predict with some [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3600.0s)]
*  Uh regularity with some confidence who was going to win without any polling [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3606.88s)]
*  And so I would say if you took all the polling out of it [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3611.04s)]
*  Um, kamala harris is kicking ass and donald trump is melting down [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3614.2400000000002s)]
*  And then if you put the polling into it, it's damn close. I love that. I love a vibes based analysis [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3618.2400000000002s)]
*  Uh, let's talk about trump [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3623.44s)]
*  So we've got I think two stories right now. One is mad king. He's bouncing and swaying to the music [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3625.52s)]
*  He's rambling seeming confused. He's canceling interviews and events the harris walls campaign is asking on social. Are you okay? [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3630.6400000000003s)]
*  And then we've got the two-bit authoritarian. He's starting to deploy the military handles enemies promising mass deportations threatening [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3637.6000000000004s)]
*  Democracy, how are you putting those two? [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3644.1400000000003s)]
*  stories together right now [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3647.84s)]
*  Well, I don't think it's that hard [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3649.76s)]
*  I mean, I think that the the problem with um characterizing him as a threat to democracy [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3651.2000000000003s)]
*  Is that you're sort of inherently giving him a ton of power? [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3656.4s)]
*  Power over our collective psyches power over the american experiment [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3659.6800000000003s)]
*  And then he seems strong [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3663.76s)]
*  And so I think what the harris campaign has done and it's sort of unlocked even in a way that the biden the successful biden campaign [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3665.36s)]
*  Um did not was this idea that sure he is a threat, but he's also a joke [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3672.96s)]
*  And if you look through history lots of people who did lots of bad things were also ridiculous figures in in in human [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3677.92s)]
*  History and so he's both of those things [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3686.88s)]
*  He's a legitimate threat to the american way of life and he's also a jackass [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3688.96s)]
*  And one of the things that I think kamala is doing well and one of the reasons that we were doing poorly [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3694.72s)]
*  With biden frankly as our standard bearer is there's just at least some portion of the electorate that wants someone [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3700.4s)]
*  who um [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3707.0400000000004s)]
*  Who's on the ball who looks like they're kind of like smacking the other side around [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3708.2400000000002s)]
*  And they're not really sure what they think about the issues [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3712.48s)]
*  But they want someone who looks like a good television president, right? [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3715.0400000000004s)]
*  Like someone who looks like they're kicking ass and kamala harris looks like she's kicking ass and whatever donald trump's like [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3718.1600000000003s)]
*  You know personal flaws and policy flaws [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3724.96s)]
*  And and and his sort of [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3727.84s)]
*  Sort of almost evil way of viewing the american experiment. He had some game back in the day [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3730.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, like he could actually be fun to watch interesting to watch infuriating to watch but like good television [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3736.4s)]
*  This is not good television anymore. And I think that there is something [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3742.4s)]
*  Pretty significant about kamala pointing that out. It's of course not the main thing [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3746.7200000000003s)]
*  But remember people vote for your side for their reasons not yours. We are not looking to get vindicated here [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3751.84s)]
*  We're just looking for the w [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3758.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's funny as you say that I hadn't thought about that way because I remember early in like 2017 2018 [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3760.1600000000003s)]
*  I would say like hey everybody we gotta like accept like [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3766.2400000000002s)]
*  Trump has some charm here. He has some charisma [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3769.44s)]
*  He can be funny and people really they did not care for it [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3771.52s)]
*  But it it reminds me have you seen these videos going around a frankie valley? [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3774.6400000000003s)]
*  Being uh brought out to the microphones to lip sync his old his there's a little bit of a frankie valley energy [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3778.48s)]
*  uh to it where he [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3785.52s)]
*  I actually hadn't thought about it that way that he really is kind of [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3787.84s)]
*  He's he's trying to do [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3791.2000000000003s)]
*  The performance he used to do and it's not it isn't working. It isn't working [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3793.92s)]
*  Listen when I so you know, I grew up in hawaii and we used to go you guys call it karaoke [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3798.6400000000003s)]
*  We call it karaoke and you know, I would always sing, you know, just once by james ingraham [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3803.2s)]
*  It was a blast. I was 16 years old then I was 26 years old and there was some point at which [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3807.68s)]
*  You know, i'm in my 30s. I'm singing just once by is it fun anymore? Is it charming anymore? [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3812.64s)]
*  Is it hilarious anymore? I feel like uh, he's sort of the last guy at the karaoke bar [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3817.6s)]
*  You know and he won't let go of the microphone [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3822.64s)]
*  You know that that story is it's it's I think it's it's helpful. It's a good analogy. It does make me sad [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3825.52s)]
*  I think you could keep doing karaoke. I don't think you need to stop [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3831.36s)]
*  I don't I don't think you can age out of it and I think that you should let that go. That's that's something that's projection [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3834.32s)]
*  Uh, listen, i'm not saying that I shouldn't sing i'm just saying I should maybe pick a new song [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3840.56s)]
*  Yeah, no, okay pick a new song pick a new song. So [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3845.12s)]
*  uh, it's a close race [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3848.0s)]
*  Rather be us than them but trump could win [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3850.6400000000003s)]
*  And based on what you're seeing right now and only to point us to places where we have to work harder [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3853.52s)]
*  Close some gaps [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3859.44s)]
*  If trump ekes it out [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3861.44s)]
*  How did he do it? How did he put together the coalition? What are we missing? [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3863.52s)]
*  I still think we need more actual human beings, uh in pennsylvania and wisconsin [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3867.84s)]
*  And we need more money in wisconsin pennsylvania and ohio for sherrod brown [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3874.24s)]
*  You know look it is it is fair to say that some of these uh races [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3879.7599999999998s)]
*  You know the die is cast the money is spent and the voters, you know [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3884.16s)]
*  It's basically up to the voters now, but there are a couple of places where it's close enough and the turnout operations matter enough [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3887.6s)]
*  And they are sophisticated enough where you could take a person [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3893.92s)]
*  From you know who lives in santa monica or lives in you know [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3897.52s)]
*  South texas and just wants to help and they get on that online phone banking thing and they actually make a difference [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3900.48s)]
*  So I I would still help in the midwest [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3905.6s)]
*  Um both by sending money and by either showing up physically or making phone calls [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3908.72s)]
*  so trump has been [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3913.7599999999998s)]
*  Uh pulling him pulling out of events clearest campaign is trying to take him out of these sort of more national [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3915.52s)]
*  platforms whether it's an mbc interview a cnbc interview 60 minutes [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3921.18s)]
*  Uh, and they're just sort of I think resigned to what he's gonna do at the rallies. Meanwhile [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3925.84s)]
*  You might your thought the thought might be okay [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3932.16s)]
*  So they're letting him letting his freak flag fly in these debates that are mostly reaching his supporters [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3934.4s)]
*  They're they're counting on the media not covering it really that effectively or kind of sane washing him or [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3939.36s)]
*  People not really seeing what he's saying at these rallies [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3945.12s)]
*  But they're gonna make up for it with ads that are more mainstream and yet in pennsylvania [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3947.52s)]
*  They're running millions upon millions of dollars of ads [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3952.2400000000002s)]
*  Uh, uh demonizing trans people as opposed to all inflation or the economy or what have you [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3955.52s)]
*  Can you make sense of it at all? [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3961.6800000000003s)]
*  Is there any theory to it that that we might look back on and say oh that that actually was smarter than it looked [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3963.76s)]
*  No, it's not smarter than it looks they tried it the last couple of cycles [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3970.1600000000003s)]
*  It doesn't work. It is their happy place ideologically [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3974.88s)]
*  And it is where they go where they when they don't have anything to run on look [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3978.0s)]
*  They want to be closing [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3982.0s)]
*  With an inflation message, right? [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3984.0s)]
*  Uh, they want to be closing with an economic message [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3986.56s)]
*  But cabela harris and the democrats and bob casey and sherrod brown and john tester and tami baldwin and everybody else have basically erased [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3989.76s)]
*  The republicans lead on the economy and so they just sort of like digging, you know, it used to be the uh, the caravans [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=3997.52s)]
*  And because the because first of all border crossings are at a not at all time low [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4004.64s)]
*  But at a low over the last several years and the republicans killed the border security bill [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4009.2s)]
*  They don't have that one [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4014.08s)]
*  They don't have inflation and so they're just kind of like digging around in their in in their trunk trying to find something [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4015.2s)]
*  And this is their sort of ideological safe space. There's no evidence that this moves [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4021.36s)]
*  Swing voters and I think tim waltz and kamala harrison everybody else is handling it [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4026.08s)]
*  Well, which is to you know stand for equality but not to dwell on it because frankly what people find offensive about that [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4030.4s)]
*  Uh regular folks is like why are you even talking about that? Like that has nothing to do with my life [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4039.12s)]
*  trump is doing a fair amount of a certain kind of press which is [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4045.04s)]
*  interviews with [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4050.62s)]
*  Podcasters and influencers in the kind of loosely part of the manosphere [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4053.1800000000003s)]
*  Uh trying to reach these lower propensity less political men [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4059.46s)]
*  um [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4065.7000000000003s)]
*  A do you worry about it and then b shakam al harris go on joe rogan [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4067.06s)]
*  Um, sure. I listen I worry about everything [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4073.06s)]
*  Um, but that doesn't mean that I think this is like the the winning strategy [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4075.54s)]
*  I think the winning strategy would be for him to you know [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4078.82s)]
*  Wake up one morning and pretend to be a moderate and you know, say nice things about democracy [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4081.54s)]
*  Um that that would worry me whether this will work or not. I have no idea. Yeah, I think she should go on joe [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4086.5s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I know people who listen to joe rogan. I think she can handle joe rogan [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4091.94s)]
*  I think as i've you know, and i've watched clips [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4096.42s)]
*  I haven't listened to like a whole joe rogan podcast because I can't set aside two and a half hours necessarily [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4098.34s)]
*  but um [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4104.26s)]
*  One of the things that I think is true about joe rogan is that he's kind of impressionable and likes to be kind to his guests [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4105.38s)]
*  And I just don't imagine that he's going to come in like loaded for bear. I'm sure he'll have [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4111.7s)]
*  Some prepped questions [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4116.1s)]
*  But in a sort of political discussion between kamala harris and joe rogan [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4117.780000000001s)]
*  I do think kamala, you know wins the exchange now does that end up in? [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4122.18s)]
*  You know a bunch of clippable memes that you know are designed to make her look bad. Sure [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4127.22s)]
*  But I still think you know, they're going to do that. Anyway, they're those memes are going to be [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4132.18s)]
*  Um created anyway, and I just think she looks strong. She looks unafraid [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4136.26s)]
*  and um, and I think one of the other things, you know, I got a couple of buddies who you know have [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4141.06s)]
*  Difficulty with kamala, but not for any real reason other than they have been sort of poisoned [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4145.84s)]
*  uh by um by the internet and so sometimes you just have to break through that palace guard and talk to people directly so [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4151.54s)]
*  But like do I think the whole campaign is going to hinge on going on joe rogan. I do not [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4158.900000000001s)]
*  I just think she should basically [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4163.7s)]
*  Find whatever audience she can find and I think what the cool thing about their campaign is [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4165.78s)]
*  I think they've figured out both like probably statistically speaking because they have real data operations and intuitively that basically wherever she goes [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4170.9s)]
*  She and she presents she ends up slightly more popular than when she came in [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4179.86s)]
*  And so my view is if that's true, then joe rogan's got 12 million people and you should talk to him [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4184.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah more more more kamala is more more trump is less brett bear. She went she did it [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4190.66s)]
*  I think there were good moments and there's moments that are exploiting whether you call it a big win [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4195.78s)]
*  A medium win a draw whatever you want to say about it. It's not going to get tougher than that [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4200.9s)]
*  It's not going to get harder than that the combination of [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4206.099999999999s)]
*  of questions designed to go for biggest vulnerabilities the [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4208.66s)]
*  Interrupting all of it was like I think as tough an interview as she could possibly have [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4212.879999999999s)]
*  Uh, so any logic for that interview to me says like go go there like just like fuck it. Um, [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4218.82s)]
*  Let's talk about the senate [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4225.139999999999s)]
*  Uh your colleague from texas john cornyn leading candidate to succeed mitch mcconnell [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4226.98s)]
*  Whether in majority or minority vowed to block nominees for kamala harris. He deems too far left [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4232.179999999999s)]
*  He said i'm not going to schedule a vote on some wild-eyed radical nominee [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4237.139999999999s)]
*  So if kamala harris wins and the senate flips will come would kamala harris be able to replace the supreme court justice [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4242.339999999999s)]
*  Or even have a cabinet [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4248.98s)]
*  I don't know the answer to that. Um, and that's why I really don't and I you know [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4250.74s)]
*  I don't like the hypotheticals just because I don't even like to stipulate either a win or a loss on either side [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4254.98s)]
*  But I but I do think it illustrates how important it is [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4260.26s)]
*  For us to focus on these senate races like there there is no [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4264.0199999999995s)]
*  Path to a kamala harris cabinet or to a rebalancing of the supreme court or to climate action or to codifying roh [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4267.78s)]
*  Or to codifying lgbtq rights or any economic progress? [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4276.26s)]
*  Without a democratic senate [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4281.22s)]
*  And I just don't want anybody to get sort of despondent here [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4283.3s)]
*  We were here two years ago and four years ago and it was predicted [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4287.22s)]
*  By all the smart people that we were going to lose the senate [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4292.18s)]
*  And then we kept the senate and then we kept the senate again [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4296.0199999999995s)]
*  And we've passed the biggest climate action in human history and we reduced the price of prescription medicine [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4298.9s)]
*  And we've done all these incredible things only because we won the senate [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4304.5s)]
*  And so yes, the presidency is job one [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4307.62s)]
*  But you know job 1a is making sure sharer brown and john tester and tammy baldwin and elissa slotkin [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4310.74s)]
*  And and bob casey returned to the senate talk to me about nebraska [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4318.18s)]
*  Texas florida i'm not going to talk about nebraska at all. I um, I don't know very much about it and I [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4323.3s)]
*  I don't want that to you know polarize [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4329.86s)]
*  What I would say about texas is that? [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4332.74s)]
*  You know beto got very very close [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4335.78s)]
*  And I think collin allred is running a slightly more disciplined campaign [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4338.66s)]
*  And a very well funded campaign [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4343.94s)]
*  um [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4346.58s)]
*  You know, he's very close and does need money [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4347.62s)]
*  and I think the theory of the case in florida is [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4351.139999999999s)]
*  Basically the same except that we have a reproductive choice on the ballot [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4354.98s)]
*  and so in a scenario where the turnout projections [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4359.54s)]
*  Are slightly under counting the number of pro-choice individuals showing up [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4364.26s)]
*  Then I think we could either win florida on the presidential or lose by a little [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4370.74s)]
*  And then debbie moocarcel powell can win [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4375.78s)]
*  She's running an extraordinary campaign, but both of those campaigns are campaigns that actually need [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4379.06s)]
*  Hard money cash. So if you've got 500 bucks laying around send the campaign not some campaign committee [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4384.58s)]
*  Not some super back send the campaign some money and they will put it right into communicating with voters [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4390.82s)]
*  Uh, so I really enjoy that nebraska's not happening. Sorry. I even raised it [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4396.66s)]
*  Forgot it forget about it huge mistake on my part forget. We don't even know what's going on there [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4400.5s)]
*  What's it's not even I think it really has nothing to do with us, frankly, uh, [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4404.66s)]
*  Correct. So interesting about nevada, arizona and florida. These are states with competitive senate races [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4408.099999999999s)]
*  They are states that uh, florida's tougher, but but where uh, [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4416.179999999999s)]
*  Traditionally, we've considered them swing states, uh in the presidential and their states with abortion ballot measures [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4421.0599999999995s)]
*  Two theories here one is the abortion ballot measures turn out people that care about basic reproductive freedom [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4428.66s)]
*  The other place like arizona you have voters who are gonna vote for rubin gaiago [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4434.0199999999995s)]
*  They're going to vote to protect abortion and then they are considering whether or not to vote for an anti-choice [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4439.0599999999995s)]
*  anti-abortion president under the [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4446.08s)]
*  Feeling that they're balancing that they're protecting abortion in arizona anyway, how do you deal with that kind of? [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4449.46s)]
*  false sense of comfort [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4456.98s)]
*  Well, I think the the the harris campaign has done a pretty effective job in making it clear that [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4459.219999999999s)]
*  Donald trump really is going to push for a national abortion ban [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4465.54s)]
*  And so it won't matter what kind of statutory protections you have at a state-by-state level [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4468.98s)]
*  And the problem is when they talk about national minimum national standards, they mean a federal [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4474.74s)]
*  Abortion ban and donald trump is going to do that. There's no doubt about it [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4481.06s)]
*  That is part of project 2025 [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4485.14s)]
*  I think we've done a very good job of getting the word out and making it clear that you sort of can't have your cake and [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4487.06s)]
*  Eat it too and vote for an anti-choice federal candidate and a pro-choice [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4492.34s)]
*  ballot amendment [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4496.9800000000005s)]
*  But the problem is that even if that is something that has gotten through for say 80 percent of the voters [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4497.78s)]
*  We kind of needed to get through to 95 percent of the voters in order for us to fully align and have the abortion rights [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4503.46s)]
*  Referendum in arizona win. Gallego win and harris win. So i'm losing my mind you surf. Should I be surfing? [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4510.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you should sure of course, uh, southern california [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4517.7s)]
*  Wow [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4521.860000000001s)]
*  It's a lot of ballots, huh? [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4522.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean but you're young you'll be fine and you know, you you you did a reality show that required all kinds of fitness [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4524.26s)]
*  You'll be fine never got to use it never got to do never. I have my balance is actually really good [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4530.1s)]
*  Never got to fucking use it [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4534.1s)]
*  Well, yeah, i'm sorry. I didn't watch it as you know [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4536.660000000001s)]
*  No, I know yeah, you should you should surf but the problem with southern california surfing is like part of part of what's good about surfing [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4539.14s)]
*  Like fishing like hiking like lots of things is that you kind of can escape the hustle and bustle [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4546.740000000001s)]
*  Southern california surfing is like as stressful as driving on the on the freeways because it's just packed and a little bit [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4551.46s)]
*  Aggressive so [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4558.339999999999s)]
*  You know those are not my vibes honestly just like using stereotypes about my culture to just putting them together [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4559.62s)]
*  Oh, we're all sitting in traffic here in california [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4565.38s)]
*  Uh you and chris murphy senator chris murphy of canada you seem close [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4568.0199999999995s)]
*  Have your hands ever brushed in a weird way chris murphy and i know we know he's very northeastern. There's no touching [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4571.38s)]
*  So that's good that's interesting, uh, so [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4579.219999999999s)]
*  So [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4582.5s)]
*  Uh home stretch just let's reiterate what you feel like people need to do you want people to go to pennsylvania? [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4583.7s)]
*  We got to get calls in and feet on the ground in pennsylvania. We need money in ohio [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4589.9400000000005s)]
*  Florida texas wisconsin and we need calls and volunteers in wisconsin. What else is the other other priorities for you right now? [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4595.76s)]
*  That's it. I mean I the other thing I would say is like don't agonize organize. I do think that um, [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4604.02s)]
*  You know, we're a party that tends to agonize too much [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4609.86s)]
*  We're a party that doesn't trust happiness and we're a party that can sometimes talk ourselves out of having the winning momentum [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4612.82s)]
*  Now kamala harris has done a lot to give us a spring in our step and it is our obligation seriously [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4620.9800000000005s)]
*  It is our obligation to stuff our phone in a sock drawer and go out there and campaign [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4626.82s)]
*  Do it people, you know, we know this show is very popular [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4633.7s)]
*  So I know how many people are listening and I know how many people have signed up at vote save america [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4637.219999999999s)]
*  And I don't like the ratio center shots. There's a lot of people listening to this that haven't done a goddamn thing [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4641.459999999999s)]
*  Well, i'm not going to scold anybody except to say [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4647.379999999999s)]
*  That here here's what I would say [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4650.339999999999s)]
*  look I um [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4652.419999999999s)]
*  My first race 26 years ago. I was running for the state house and I came [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4654.74s)]
*  Came out of the primary election kind of bruised. I didn't look super strong [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4658.74s)]
*  and um a mentor of mine said let's assume you're [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4663.379999999999s)]
*  Behind by about a thousand votes [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4666.98s)]
*  And you've got 90 days left [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4669.78s)]
*  So you got to win over something like 12 people a day and let's assume you win over [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4672.259999999999s)]
*  One in four people that you talk to you're not winning over everybody [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4678.419999999999s)]
*  Okay [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4682.74s)]
*  You got to go talk to about 50 humans every day for the next 90 days and then you're going to win this thing [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4682.98s)]
*  And that's what I did [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4688.339999999999s)]
*  I actually knocked on doors to the point where people told me to stop calling and coming by [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4689.0599999999995s)]
*  I wore my shoes out to the point where I had to buy a new pair of rock porches from the local Ross on ward avenue [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4693.379999999999s)]
*  And I won by 425 votes and I would not have won by 425 votes [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4700.259999999999s)]
*  If I stared at a screen wondering if I was going to win by 425 votes what happens next? [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4705.459999999999s)]
*  Depends on us. It does not depend on events far away [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4711.78s)]
*  It depends on what we all do what all of the listeners do [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4715.54s)]
*  So if you haven't sort of taken the step to either [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4718.58s)]
*  Press the donate button or to get on the phone and start calling family and friends or a list provided by the campaign [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4721.62s)]
*  Now's the time now's the time what a great message to end on and I just also want to say wherever you are [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4729.14s)]
*  Even if you cannot physically get to wisconsin, pennsylvania or any of these other swing states [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4736.1s)]
*  Uh, you can call into those states you can donate into those states and I guarantee you [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4741.7s)]
*  Wherever you are you are within 90 minutes of a house race [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4746.099999999999s)]
*  That could swing the balance in the house and you can go knock on doors there [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4750.98s)]
*  John tommy and I begin to hitting some of the doors in california as well. So go to vote save america.com the time [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4754.5s)]

*  Always always so good to see you. It's good to see you too john [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4768.82s)]
*  I'll look forward to watching survivor for the first time. That's great. Maybe something something we can do after we win [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4772.42s)]
*  Okay, take care [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4777.94s)]
*  That's our show for today. Wow, what a show. Thank you senator dan and guest host alex waggoner of msnbc prime time fame [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YsTKE263Ys&t=4779.46s)]
