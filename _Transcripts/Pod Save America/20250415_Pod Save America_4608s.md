Video Description: Donald Trump and the president of El Salvador gloat about shipping migrants to a Salvadoran mega-prison, muse about sending American citizens there next, and lie about the court orders they're ignoring. Jon, Lovett, and Tommy break down what it means for the administration to ignore the Supreme Court's order to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the message Trump is sending to student visa holders with the arrest of Rümeysa Öztürk, why Trump's war on the media appears to be succeeding, and reports that the Trump family is teaming up with Binance, the shady crypto platform, on a new money-making scheme. Then, Bloomberg's Joe Weisenthal joins Jon to talk about Trump's trade war, the possibility of a recession, and what might happen next.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Trump Ignores SCOTUS, Plans To Send AMERICAN CITIZENS To El Salvador Prison
**Pod Save America:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs)
*  Their general strategy is to lie about what's happening in the courts, lie about what the courts are saying. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=0.0s)]
*  The craziest new one, I think it's over the weekend, was Stephen Miller now arguing that the administration didn't make a mistake when it sent Abrego Garcia del Salvador. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4.4s)]
*  The Solicitor General said it was a mistake. The Supreme Court wrote in its opinion that it was a mistake. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=12.56s)]
*  DOJ has admitted it was a mistake at every single hearing, but Miller is now just gaslighting. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=17.76s)]
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Jon Favreau. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=22.48s)]
*  I'm Jon Lovett. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=24.48s)]
*  I'm Tommy Hathor. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=25.12s)]
*  On today's show, we're going to talk about the latest developments in Trump's war on the media and the latest in Trump's war on the global economy. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=26.159999999999997s)]
*  I'll also be talking to Bloomberg's Joe Weisenthal about the impact of Trump's tariffs on the US economy and how all of this could shake out. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=33.199999999999996s)]
*  But let's start with our most cheerful topic, Trump's war on the Constitution, specifically his government's illegal renditions of innocent people to a foreign prison. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=41.44s)]
*  On Monday morning, Trump hosted an Oval Office press conference with the president of El Salvador, Naib Bukele, who oversees the notorious 40,000 person torture dungeon known as CICOT, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=50.48s)]
*  where Trump has been sending people who the government says are gang members, assertions they're making without offering any evidence or allowing any hearings. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=60.72s)]
*  The meeting came just a few days after the Supreme Court issued a ruling on the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=68.56s)]
*  a Maryland father and husband of an American citizen who the government mistakenly and illegally sent to the El Salvador prison, a fact that multiple Trump officials admitted in court, including Trump's solicitor general. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=74.32s)]
*  The SCOTUS ruling, in which there were no dissents, said that a lower court's order, quote, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  The Trump administration has responded by making the argument in court and in public that actually they have no legal obligation to facilitate Garcia's release, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=104.8s)]
*  and they interpret the Supreme Court's ruling to mean that the US only has to allow Garcia back into the country if El Salvador chooses to release him. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=113.52s)]
*  Here's Trump and Bukele talking about this in the Oval today, joined by Stephen Miller. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=121.83999999999999s)]
*  The ruling solely stated that if this individual at El Salvador's sole discretion was sent back to our country, that we could deport him a second time. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=134.79999999999998s)]
*  No version of this legally ends up with him ever living here. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  How can I return him to the United States? If I smuggle him into the United States, what am I going to do? Of course, I'm not going to do it. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=164.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, the President and Mr. President, you said that if the Supreme Court said someone needed to be returned, that you would abide by that. You said that on Air Force One just a few days ago. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=173.92s)]
*  How long do we have to answer this question? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  Why don't you just say, isn't it wonderful that we're keeping criminals out of our country? Why can't you just say that? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=183.76s)]
*  Just incredibly dark and infuriating. And I mean, they lie all the time, but Stephen Miller's just complete lie about what is in the Supreme Court ruling and what it says is shocking. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=190.16s)]
*  Just making up quotes, making up assertions from the Supreme Court ruling. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=206.48s)]
*  What did you guys make of the discussion in the Oval about this and how the administration is responding to the Supreme Court? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=211.28s)]
*  A few thoughts. I mean, I thought it was notable that Trump himself doesn't seem all that comfortable talking about the details. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=218.64s)]
*  He deferred to Pam Bondi. He deferred to Stephen Miller. Even sad little Marco Rubio decided to weigh in because he couldn't bear being left out. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=223.92s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, your point that their general strategy is to lie about what's happening in the courts, lie about what the courts are saying. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=230.56s)]
*  The craziest new one, I think this is over the weekend, was Stephen Miller now arguing that the administration didn't make a mistake when it sent Abrego Garcia del Salvador. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  The Solicitor General said it was a mistake. The Supreme Court wrote in its opinion that it was a mistake. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=246.0s)]
*  DOJ has admitted it was a mistake at every single hearing, but Miller is now just gaslighting. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=250.72s)]
*  Miller also said, I think it was on Fox News, that the gang that was threatening Garcia no longer exists, therefore it's not a problem to send him to El Salvador. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=256.48s)]
*  I don't know if that's true, but if it is true, it's because all those gang members are now in the prison where they sent this man to rot wrongly based on a mistake. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=264.08s)]
*  So they're also just looking to find every loophole or technicality to avoid doing what the court says. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=271.52s)]
*  Like we're debating what the meaning of effectuate or facilitate means. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=276.88s)]
*  And then finally, I mean, watching Trump and his team watching Bukele sit there sneering, smugly laughing, enjoying it all made me feel like. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=281.6s)]
*  And I talked to a very smart immigration lawyer today who said something similar that it seems very unlikely the courts are going to be able to get Abrego Garcia back. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=292.28s)]
*  Because ultimately, the courts will say the US government can't order Bukele to do something. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=299.68s)]
*  They can't order El Salvador to do something. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=305.52s)]
*  And I think that what that says is that the only thing that we can do is keep up the public pressure, keep the keep talking about this, keep the story in the news. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=308.6s)]
*  Because, you know, Bukele's line is like, oh, I'm not going to smuggle a man back into the United States. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=321.0s)]
*  That's not what has to happen. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=324.76s)]
*  Bukele needs to let Abrego Garcia out of prison. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=326.36s)]
*  Then he can buy a plane ticket and fly to the United States. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=329.48s)]
*  It's just that simple. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=332.08s)]
*  But, you know, it's what he's content holding a man in prison who is not even accused of committing a crime in El Salvador because he left the country when he was 16 years old. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=333.52s)]
*  Yeah. So I feel like we've rightly focused on trying to fix this right away. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=343.56s)]
*  And then the larger implications of it in terms of what it means if the president can send someone to a foreign gulag and then because that gulag is on foreign soil, basically wash his hands of any responsibility. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=351.28s)]
*  And that is terrible. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=364.88s)]
*  I do think we're just skipping over a little bit what we need to learn about how depraved these people are because it's so baked into our understanding of Trump and Stephen Miller and now Marco Rubio and all of these people that they are cruel and inhumane, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=366.47999999999996s)]
*  that we don't really pause to say, don't you want to fix this? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=380.96s)]
*  Even by your own standards, even by your own claims about the implications of this policy? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=385.32s)]
*  Well, their claims are that he's a foreign terrorist. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=389.56s)]
*  But they know that that's a lie, right? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=391.4s)]
*  They know it's a lie that they're they're doing a kind of they're prevaricating, they're playing games with the courts, they're outright lying about what the court has ruled or about the facts of the case. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=392.79999999999995s)]
*  But they know those statements aren't true. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=404.08s)]
*  They know that this person was sent in error and they really don't care. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=405.79999999999995s)]
*  And so when we start talking about what it looks like for Trump to try to expand deportations to this prison, we start to talk about what it looks like for them to want to send citizens to this place. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=410.44s)]
*  We should just make sure we're noting that their kind of humanity is not kicking in here. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=420.88s)]
*  There's no there's no hope that we'll be able to appeal to their better angels, not even the Marco Rubio's right. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=427.15999999999997s)]
*  The supposedly serious and establishment types who are outright participants in this. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=432.35999999999996s)]
*  He's the one who made the deal with Bukele. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=436.47999999999996s)]
*  He was gone long ago. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=439.52s)]
*  I mean, I just Stephen Miller on Fox, you mentioned it, Tommy, like what he said about he's like, it was not an error. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=441.03999999999996s)]
*  And he said in the end, the lawyer, the DOJ lawyer who said it was an error, they were wrong and they were put on leave. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=448.59999999999997s)]
*  And that was a they've been relieved of duty. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=454.91999999999996s)]
*  He's a saboteur, a Democrat. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=457.12s)]
*  And it's just like it's such an obvious lie. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=459.59999999999997s)]
*  The guy was like promoted a couple of weeks before he was relieved for all his good work on sanctuary cities. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=462.2s)]
*  The head of removal of operations at ICE also admitted it was an error. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=467.64000000000004s)]
*  The top DOJ official also admitted error. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=471.28000000000003s)]
*  The Solicitor General of the United States in the Supreme Court also admitted an error. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=473.40000000000003s)]
*  I do think that like I don't know. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=477.52000000000004s)]
*  I don't know that the courts will be able to bring him back at this point. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=480.48s)]
*  But I think that the Supreme Court has a big decision to make because Judge Zinnis, who is the district court judge in Maryland, who ruled on this. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=483.72s)]
*  First of all, it's it's 630 p.m. right now, East Coast time on Monday. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=494.44s)]
*  And the government has not provided an update, a daily update about a Briego Garcia like they are had been ordered to do by Zinnis. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=498.91999999999996s)]
*  She has a full hearing on Tuesday when you're listening to this. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=505.79999999999995s)]
*  And it's going to get back to the Supreme Court at some point. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=508.91999999999996s)]
*  And John Roberts and the entire court has to know that they have made the Trump administration has made a mockery of their order. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=512.4s)]
*  They have misstated it. They have lied about it. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=521.0s)]
*  They have said things that it doesn't actually say. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=523.32s)]
*  And are they just going to like let this go and be like, all right, well, they they got us on this one. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=525.7600000000001s)]
*  They decided to lie about it, not bring him back. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=531.48s)]
*  And so nothing we can do because it's making what the Trump administration is doing in Stephen Miller in particular. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=533.1600000000001s)]
*  They are making a mockery of the Supreme Court right now. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=538.9200000000001s)]
*  They're not just defying it. They are making a mockery of it. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=541.48s)]
*  Two points about that. One, it is interesting the way Trump believes he still has to perform that he will defer to the law and defer to the law. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=544.1600000000001s)]
*  Even as everyone under him is playing games. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=553.76s)]
*  That is something I worry about changing right now. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=556.9599999999999s)]
*  He's saying, look, we're not going to poor people. It's a violation of law. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=559.52s)]
*  I respect the Supreme Court. We're going to follow the Supreme Court, even as they're playing games underneath. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=562.0799999999999s)]
*  That's a place where he's not sure yet. Right. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=566.4s)]
*  He's gone farther this term than he did last term. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=568.64s)]
*  He is pushing new boundaries, but that's a line he hasn't crossed yet. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=570.8399999999999s)]
*  And, you know, when will he cross it? I feel like he will. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=573.8399999999999s)]
*  The question is when. The other part of this, too, is, yes, this is about making a mockery. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=578.0s)]
*  The Supreme Court is about the implications of all this. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=582.76s)]
*  But one thing I really appreciate about the way Judge Zinnis has been talking about this is these are, you know, Trump is there. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=584.84s)]
*  They're doing this performative bluster and infallibility around this around Kilmar. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=591.8s)]
*  It's a person. He's just there. He's been there for 30 days. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=596.04s)]
*  Andre has been there for 30 days. They don't know that there are cases pending. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=599.8s)]
*  They don't know that they're leading the nightly news. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=603.0s)]
*  They don't know that that there's an ongoing dispute in front of the Supreme Court about their case. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=604.48s)]
*  They have been removed without communication. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=608.52s)]
*  They have been disappeared. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=610.96s)]
*  There's another example just broke right before a recording documented, which is a news outlet that covers immigration out of New York. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=613.2s)]
*  Another case, Merwill Gutierrez, somebody who also applied legally at the border, came in through a port of entry, applied through CBP. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=619.8000000000001s)]
*  CBP one was working, just grabbed off the street. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=627.5600000000001s)]
*  His father had to go precinct to precinct in New York trying to figure out where his son was because there's no information. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=631.32s)]
*  The place where you check online to see where your relative is, says he's in Pennsylvania. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=637.56s)]
*  Apparently, he's been already disappeared to El Salvador, basically trying to find information. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=643.68s)]
*  No one can give this guy information because his son has been disappeared the way evil authoritarian regimes disappear people without regard for due process, without regard for the law, going door to door trying to find information. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=648.04s)]
*  Is that what America is to Marco Rubio now? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=659.4s)]
*  A place where if you're if you're in the wrong place at the wrong time, no tattoos, not that tattoos should matter, no evidence of having done anything. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=661.24s)]
*  And now the relatives have to go searching the precincts. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=667.64s)]
*  That's what happens in that's what happens in communist regimes. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=670.88s)]
*  That's what happens in totalitarian regimes. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=675.28s)]
*  People having to hold up pictures of their loved ones because the state has taken them. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=676.84s)]
*  And it's happening. It's happening right in front of us. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=680.92s)]
*  And, you know, it got even worse in the Oval, if you can believe it. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=683.36s)]
*  Trump was also asked about his stated desire to render American citizens to El Salvador, which he has now said multiple times. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=688.4399999999999s)]
*  Said it again in the Oval today. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=696.6s)]
*  He said he's open to it for Americans who've been convicted of certain crimes. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=699.16s)]
*  He was also then heard in the Oval telling Bukele, quote, the homegrowns are next. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=704.52s)]
*  You got to build about five more places. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=710.1999999999999s)]
*  This is when he didn't even think the cameras, you know, the cameras were really on them. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=712.8s)]
*  This comes after new reporting from Rolling Stone that the White House is discussing how they can strip naturalized Americans of their citizenship. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=717.64s)]
*  And they've been talking about this for quite a while. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=725.88s)]
*  It was in Axios about a month ago as well. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=728.36s)]
*  There was also a report from Politico over the weekend that former Blackwater CEO Eric Prince is pitching the White House on a two part plan to increase deportations to El Salvador. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=730.64s)]
*  First part is to pay Prince and his private contractors to handle the logistics of deportation. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=739.88s)]
*  And the second step is to declare a section of CICOT, the El Salvadoran gulag, to be US territory so they can get around the laws that they're already breaking. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=744.64s)]
*  Trump and Bukele were expected to discuss this proposal in private at the White House. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=755.0s)]
*  You know, legal experts are saying everywhere the courts would never allow this. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=760.24s)]
*  Sure seems like that doesn't matter to the Trump White House. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=764.44s)]
*  What do you guys think? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=766.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think we should take Trump at his word, which is that he would love to deport American citizens to El Salvador to rot in hell in this gulag. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=767.88s)]
*  And I think Trump will claim, of course, that it's only the worst of the worst. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=774.36s)]
*  It's dangerous people. It's terrorists. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=777.88s)]
*  But remember, Trump can just declare that a group is a terrorist organization. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=779.44s)]
*  Pam Bondi called vandalism of Tesla's domestic terrorism. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=783.4s)]
*  So it's not at all difficult to imagine the White House declaring that protesters or political enemies are terrorists who thus need to be sent to El Salvador because we can't possibly have them here, especially if it is in the wake of some kind of domestic [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=786.72s)]
*  terrorist hack or major incident, because there's always a crackdown on civil liberties in those moments. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=800.48s)]
*  And so we might be a long way from this happening. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=805.6800000000001s)]
*  It might sound hyperbolic. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=808.12s)]
*  Of course, the courts would have a word they would they would probably declare it unconstitutional or illegal. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=809.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm sure it would be very unpopular. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=815.96s)]
*  But it's a serious concern. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=817.6400000000001s)]
*  And, man, fucking Eric Prince, like that guy, every idea he pitches is terrible. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=819.36s)]
*  He floated privatizing the war in Afghanistan. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=824.8800000000001s)]
*  There's discussions about him taking over rare earth mineral mines in the DRC on behalf of the United States. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=827.44s)]
*  Like, I get them deciding that part of this prison in El Salvador is actually U.S. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=834.84s)]
*  territory and therefore it's legal to send U.S. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=838.9200000000001s)]
*  citizens there. That is made up legal thinking. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=841.32s)]
*  It will never fly in a court of law or public opinion, I don't think. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=844.2800000000001s)]
*  But it doesn't mean that they won't do it. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=848.44s)]
*  Look at the pattern around what has happened with noncitizens being sent to this place, which in violation of the law. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=850.6s)]
*  It's it's a surprise. They move quickly. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=858.08s)]
*  Some are there's evidence against some no evidence against others. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=861.36s)]
*  They're they're filling these planes. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=865.8800000000001s)]
*  They're trying to get stay ahead of the courts. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=867.2s)]
*  And then the courts intercede to try to slow it down. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=869.44s)]
*  The Trump administration plays games and it's El Salvador is basically just a big pit. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=872.36s)]
*  They throw people in once they're in the pit. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=878.24s)]
*  They can't do anything to get them out of the pit. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=879.7600000000001s)]
*  My question is, are citizens going to be subjected to this before the courts intervene or not? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=882.16s)]
*  Are we going to need test cases of human beings grabbed by the administration and sent to some foreign hellhole for the court to try to stop it? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=888.3199999999999s)]
*  Or there's going to be is there going to be some mechanism that the Supreme Court will use? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=896.24s)]
*  Maybe it's one of these cases around Kilmar, around Andre, around one of these other people that we're learning about, where they make it clear that this is unconstitutional for citizens and noncitizens alike. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=900.4399999999999s)]
*  I don't know. And this is why I think that the Supreme Court has to step in here. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=910.5999999999999s)]
*  Even if I mean, they're defying the order. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=914.4399999999999s)]
*  Right. You could see a situation where the Trump administration says we asked El Salvador to facilitate the release. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=916.76s)]
*  And Bukele says, no, he cannot because he has evidence that the guy is a terrorist and he wants him back. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=925.56s)]
*  And it would, you know, hurt our for, you know, our relations with them and blah, blah, blah. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=931.2399999999999s)]
*  It's foreign policy. What makes them argument? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=935.52s)]
*  And then we lose the argument. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=937.7199999999999s)]
*  They're not even trying to do that. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=938.88s)]
*  And I don't know that Bukele really helped the whole case by saying, oh, I have no power. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=940.52s)]
*  Bukele is saying I have no power to release them from prison. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=946.8000000000001s)]
*  And then the Trump administration saying we have no power to get them back. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=950.4s)]
*  So who's running the prison? Who has the power to to decide what happens to the people? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=953.5600000000001s)]
*  And it is absurd on its face. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=958.5600000000001s)]
*  And if the Supreme Court, this is why the Supreme Court needs to step in, not just for like the potential of getting Garcia back in some of the Venezuelans and some of the people who've already been deported. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=959.96s)]
*  Wrongly or renditioned to El Salvador, but for what's coming with citizens. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=968.56s)]
*  Right. Like there was a there's an immigration lawyer from Massachusetts. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=974.36s)]
*  She's a U.S. citizen. 40 years old. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=977.6s)]
*  Grew up in Newton, Mass. Her whole life. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=979.16s)]
*  She got an email from C.P.B. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=981.12s)]
*  ordering her to leave the country in seven days saying your parole has been eliminated. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=982.88s)]
*  And C.P.B. said in response, it may have been unintended. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=986.88s)]
*  It may have been unintended. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=992.28s)]
*  But under the Trump administration's reasoning, what they're arguing in court right now, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=993.48s)]
*  if ICE had found this woman and and saw this mistake in order and didn't know she was a citizen, grabbed her, threw in the back of a van, sent her to detention center and got her on the plane to El Salvador and then realized, oh, shit, she's an American citizen. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=998.4399999999999s)]
*  Trump administration has no power to bring her back. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1012.12s)]
*  That's their argument that sorry, Bukele, he wants to keep her. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1014.0s)]
*  What can we do? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1017.48s)]
*  Well, you know, a citizen. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1018.28s)]
*  By the way, they're barely even making that argument. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1019.48s)]
*  Right. This is just like the fear. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1021.3199999999999s)]
*  The fear when the Trump administration before the ruling started talking about how these people are out of their custody was they would just tell the court they tried and failed with a wink and a nod to an ally in El Salvador. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1023.8s)]
*  They're not even doing that. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1035.52s)]
*  I also was just when I was reading about the Gutierrez case just before I recorded, that's another basically it seems like he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1037.16s)]
*  Gets rounded up suddenly find yourself in Texas because one of the ICE one of the ICE agents said, oh, he's not the one we're looking for. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1046.12s)]
*  And the other one was like, just grab him anyway. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1051.76s)]
*  And so they're trying to fill these planes with Venezuelans. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1053.64s)]
*  This is their test case. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1058.0800000000002s)]
*  This was their first attempt. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1059.16s)]
*  This was their way of signaling a new policy. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1060.44s)]
*  This was their trial run. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1063.44s)]
*  Do we really think they're going to make fewer mistakes when they're doing more plain loads of people, when they're doing thousands of people, not hundreds of people to really think they're not going to make more mistakes when they've dispatched even greater numbers of ICE agents to try to round up more people? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1066.5600000000002s)]
*  Well, the Washington Post reported that the goal for one year is a million people. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1081.76s)]
*  Stephen Miller is like the guy driving the organization every single day to deport one million people this year. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1085.6s)]
*  So we also have some updates on the case of Rumeysa Ozturk, the Tufts University PhD student from Turkey, who masked agents grabbed off the streets of Somerville, Massachusetts, threw into the back of a van and sent her to a detention center in Louisiana. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1092.3999999999999s)]
*  On Sunday, the Washington Post's John Hudson reported that an internal State Department memo from before Ozturk's detainment said there was no evidence that she had engaged in any kind of anti-Semitic or pro-terrorist activity or rhetoric. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1106.8799999999999s)]
*  As the government is claiming, she simply signed an op-ed that criticized Tufts for its response to Gaza. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1122.08s)]
*  So Benji Sarlin at the Post responded to the story with a post that asks, are they incompetently picking horrifyingly weak test cases or deliberately bringing them to scare the largest possible number of people? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1129.84s)]
*  What do you guys think? Because I find it hard to argue at this point that it's the former and not the latter. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1144.48s)]
*  So ProPublica has this piece up about her detention that's worth reading. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1150.64s)]
*  And it sounds like what happened was Ozturk was doxxed by this group called Canary Mission, this right wing pro-Israel group. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1154.32s)]
*  They have this anonymously run website. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1161.1200000000001s)]
*  They doxx students, they doxx teachers and organizations that are ostensibly or they claim are hostile to Israel. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1163.44s)]
*  There's even reports that Canary Mission has ties to Israeli intelligence. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1170.08s)]
*  But her sin here, as you said, was she was one of four co-signers of an op-ed in the Tufts student newspaper. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1173.56s)]
*  It criticized the school for refusing to quote, divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel and quote, being dismissive of the Senate, the collective voice of the student body. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1179.48s)]
*  Like the whole thing was pretty banal. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1188.1999999999998s)]
*  It was just a bunch of policy demands. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1190.04s)]
*  So I don't think they are bringing purposefully weak cases. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1191.6799999999998s)]
*  I think the overwhelming majority of cases are weak because we are talking about completely reasonable free speech that has been demonized by groups like Canary Mission because they want to scare people. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1195.84s)]
*  Out of criticizing Israel. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1209.28s)]
*  And then broadly, the administration is now undergoing this effort to strip student visas from these kids because they want to terrify people into leaving the country, never coming here at all, not speaking up at the first place and just intimidating. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1211.8s)]
*  Well, it's working because travel and tourism to the United States is cratering. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1223.52s)]
*  Including from Canadians. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1228.6s)]
*  Well, and what you said there, Tommy, about Canary, right, is think about this administration now and who it's filled with. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1229.9199999999998s)]
*  It is filled with people from right wing media fever swamps. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1235.76s)]
*  And so, of course, the sources of their information, their intelligence about who's a supposed terrorist and who's a danger to the country are coming from, like, you know, random people who are doxing other people and right wing fever swamps and all that bullshit. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1240.32s)]
*  So, you know, they probably think, well, this I read this somewhere and some post from some right wing blogger. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1254.6799999999998s)]
*  So I guess it must be true. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1260.52s)]
*  Yeah, in the letter that the Trump administration sent to Harvard with their list of demands to get federal funding, one of those are on international admissions. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1261.8400000000001s)]
*  By August 20, 25, the university must perform its recruitment, screening and admissions of international students, prevent admitting students hostile to the American values and institutions inscribed in the U.S. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1269.68s)]
*  Constitution, dot, dot, dot, including students supportive of terrorism and anti-Semitism. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1277.92s)]
*  They are putting pressure on these schools around international students. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1283.3200000000002s)]
*  First of all, that's just a lever because a lot of international students pay full price. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1286.48s)]
*  But also, I do think they want they want I mean, I think they just want Brown students to be especially well behaved. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1290.32s)]
*  Right. If you're from an unsavory part of the world, you're here as our guest. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1296.36s)]
*  We don't want to have any Muslims on campus acting as if they're anything other than lucky to be here. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1300.68s)]
*  And if you step out of line even a little bit, you will pay. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1306.32s)]
*  I do think that's true. That's guiding all of us. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1309.76s)]
*  True. But plenty of people from other countries who are not Brown are also getting swept up in this. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1311.68s)]
*  And I'm only saying that because this is a larger issue than like they don't want anyone here in this country. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1317.32s)]
*  The I do think that they look at somebody. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1324.9199999999998s)]
*  Germans, Canadians. I mean, but they look at somebody. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1327.76s)]
*  I bet they like the Germans. Let's be real. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1330.76s)]
*  Yeah, the Germans. The German guy got beat up at Logan. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1332.3999999999999s)]
*  There is something I think they just sort of they see Arab students or students from the Middle East protesting in the U.S. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1335.1599999999999s)]
*  and it just makes them angry. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1341.2s)]
*  And I do think that that's part of it and why they don't really give a fuck. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1342.8799999999999s)]
*  I do think they'll like I think it's actually just answer your question. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1345.28s)]
*  I think some of these are signal cases. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1348.24s)]
*  They're grabbing people for the sin of writing op eds. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1350.0s)]
*  They are sending a message. They are also haphazard, cruel, feckless. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1352.24s)]
*  And other people are getting swept up in their incompetence. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1355.96s)]
*  I mean, the most dangerous force in human history is a cruel bureaucracy that doesn't care about the consequences for the people it's hurting. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1358.6s)]
*  And I will just say again, you know, I saw Chris Van Hollen, senator from Maryland today, say that he was he was going to demand a meeting [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1366.52s)]
*  with Bukele while he's in Washington this week. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1374.96s)]
*  And if not, he will travel down to El Salvador himself. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1377.6000000000001s)]
*  Good for him. Which is great. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1381.52s)]
*  Like that is the best thing I've seen from a Democratic politician. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1383.24s)]
*  I saw Senator Padilla, our senator from California, post something about this Schumer has a comment about this. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1386.44s)]
*  A bunch of House members have a comment about this. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1393.48s)]
*  Still not enough in my in my view. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1395.8s)]
*  There's still a lot of senators, Democratic senators, who are still just tweeting about tariffs and Medicaid and all the other stuff. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1398.2s)]
*  And not talking about this. And it just feels like a real emergency. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1404.32s)]
*  And it's about so much more than this one person from Maryland. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1409.08s)]
*  This is just the case that because the government admitted they made the error. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1413.8799999999999s)]
*  It's like it's the most obvious case that went to the Supreme Court. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1417.2s)]
*  But the idea of Trump saying, I want to send citizens there like this is the moment for like all of the elected Democrats to get out there and make a huge deal about this. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1420.32s)]
*  I think I don't know. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1431.0s)]
*  Yeah. The other part of it, too, is there's still a lot of like, can he do this? [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1432.16s)]
*  No, he cannot send U.S. citizens to a foreign gulag. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1436.32s)]
*  We have rights. We have rights under our Constitution. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1441.52s)]
*  He does not get to abrogate those rights. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1444.52s)]
*  He does not get to pretend the Constitution doesn't exist. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1446.0s)]
*  And the question is, what are we going to do to make sure that those rights are protected? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1448.28s)]
*  And also noncitizens have the right to due process. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1450.8799999999999s)]

*  So the only reporter who pressed Trump and Bukele about the renditions was CNN's Caitlin Collins, who was at first denied a question. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1552.0s)]
*  And then when she did finally ask them, she was attacked for asking her questions by Trump, Bukele, Stephen Miller, others in the Oval. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1559.64s)]
*  Even though a federal judge ruled last week that Trump's decision to ban the Associated Press from covering the White House is unlawful. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1566.2s)]
*  The AP was excluded again from today's Oval Office press pool. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1572.8s)]
*  And then on Sunday night, Trump took to Truth Social to revive his call for the FCC to strip CBS's broadcast license after watching 60 Minutes. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1577.76s)]
*  Apparently over segments they did about the war in Ukraine and Trump's efforts to take over Greenland. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1586.3200000000002s)]
*  Reminder that Trump also has an active lawsuit against CBS over the 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1591.8400000000001s)]
*  You guys surprised the White House Correspondents Association hasn't done more to stand up for the AP, especially after today's stunt? [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1598.16s)]
*  I would say I'm disappointed, but I'm not surprised. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1606.04s)]
*  I think the White House Correspondents Association never really figured out an effective way to respond to Trump during the first term. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1608.0s)]
*  And things have gotten exponentially worse. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1613.2s)]
*  And I think in fairness to them, it's a very difficult task because the biggest problem is getting reporters from different news outlets with different incentives to take collective action that might harm their interests. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1615.52s)]
*  Or their ability to report. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1627.44s)]
*  And the second challenge is the White House loves the fight. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1628.92s)]
*  They want to fight with the press. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1633.3600000000001s)]
*  They want to use them as a foil. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1634.88s)]
*  They want to twist what they do and say in defense of press freedom to make them look biased. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1636.0800000000002s)]
*  And so it's just a lose lose proposition for these reporters in a lot of ways. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1641.56s)]
*  And you end up seeing the White House Correspondents Association being like, oh, we're fighting back by wearing a fucking pin. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1645.56s)]
*  You know, and it just looks so feckless. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1650.48s)]
*  And there's a third part that makes it hard, which is the White House is controlled by Donald Trump. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1651.96s)]
*  And we have seen the way they play games when courts rule. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1655.68s)]
*  But Donald Trump controls the White House. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1660.6000000000001s)]
*  He controls who's led into that room. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1662.1200000000001s)]
*  And as much as Caitlin Collins is there because of tradition, because she's expected to be there, Trump could decide at any moment to say no. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1663.3200000000002s)]
*  And so it's a little bit of a game of chicken. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1671.3200000000002s)]
*  I don't think it's wrong to at least consider the possibility that if the press says we're not, you know, we're all doing this together, if the AP is not in, we're not [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1674.3200000000002s)]
*  it will just be the the mag of freaks and girl and boyfriends of MTG in there. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1682.32s)]
*  I do want to say, like, good for Caitlin Collins. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1687.8s)]
*  I that is hard. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1691.0s)]
*  She is in that room. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1692.76s)]
*  She is asking tough questions. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1694.28s)]
*  She's being jeered at by members of the administration. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1696.1599999999999s)]
*  She's being bullied by the president of the United States for asking completely reasonable questions into, you know, trying to keep the conversation focused on actual substantive issues while fucking chuds left and right. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1699.08s)]
*  We're like, Mr. President, have you gotten taller? [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1709.6399999999999s)]
*  Talk to us about how healthy you are. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1711.1999999999998s)]
*  That kind of question. And that is a hard thing to do. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1712.3999999999999s)]
*  It's hard to stand there and just be kind of just like be jeered at while you're doing your job and asking completely reasonable questions. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1715.48s)]
*  I saw a couple of people saying, like, maybe they all should have banded together when they denied the AP today and been like, all right, we're not going in. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1721.56s)]
*  But like, if Caitlin Collins wasn't there today, I don't know that we would have gotten a question about Garcia, because when he first denied her a question and he went to someone else, I don't know who it was. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1728.32s)]
*  They asked like a fine question about about Ukraine and Russia. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1738.88s)]
*  But I was like, I was shocked that the first question wasn't obviously about Buckeye and Garcia. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1742.16s)]
*  And and then and then most of them are just ridiculous questions. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1749.88s)]
*  So it's like you do need you do need some reporters who are still allowed asking tough questions. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1754.6000000000001s)]
*  But it's a real hard. It's a hard challenge. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1758.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I guess I'm at the point where I don't believe the way you challenge Trump is by taking away coverage of him. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1761.0800000000002s)]
*  I just don't think that that's effective. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1770.44s)]
*  And I don't know what other tools they have. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1772.24s)]
*  It's not easy. But I do think that we are better off for Caitlin Collins having been there. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1773.6000000000001s)]
*  In the Truth post about punishing CBS, Trump specifically praised FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, saying basically, I sure hope he does the right thing here. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1780.2800000000002s)]
*  What do we know about Carr and what he what he might do or can do, I guess? [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1787.84s)]
*  Well, he's the chairman of the FCC. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1793.0s)]
*  He's a right wing activist. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1796.56s)]
*  He wrote the Project 2025 chapter on the FCC. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1797.84s)]
*  He's known for playing hardball and using all the tools at his disposal to go after media organizations that Trump decides are biased in some way. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1802.0s)]
*  For example, he's currently or has demanded that CBS turn over all these internal documents about an interview they did with Kamala Harris. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1808.9599999999998s)]
*  That Trump was not a part of because Trump says is unfairly edited, utterly ridiculous. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1817.44s)]
*  But Carr did Trump's bidding there. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1822.28s)]
*  Carr was also, I believe, spotted recently wearing a golden Trump pin. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1824.64s)]
*  Did you guys all see this? [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1828.68s)]
*  Yes, I did see that he was wearing a Trump. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1829.44s)]
*  I would I would I want us to actually not call it a pin. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1831.72s)]
*  It was a fucking broach. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1834.0s)]
*  It was a broach wearing a Trump broach. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1835.32s)]
*  This fucking is wearing a Trump broach. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1837.28s)]
*  It's a golden is a golden broach. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1839.6s)]
*  It is the fucking queeniest fucking thing a person could have. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1842.36s)]
*  It was drag. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1846.16s)]
*  He was wearing Trump drag. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1847.0s)]
*  Was it so with his face on the front space looking up at him? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1848.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1852.2s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1853.92s)]
*  So the broach is obviously the real problem. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1855.12s)]
*  But the other challenge is that there's a lot of concern that CBS is going to cave to everything Trump wants because they're worried about their parent company Paramount Global getting FCC approval to merge with SkyDance Media. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1856.96s)]
*  And Trump has lodged this, I think, twenty billion dollar lawsuit against CBS News. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1869.32s)]
*  So there's just a lot of lawfare happening. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1873.8s)]
*  Speaking of corporate media capitulation, you guys see the Michael Wolf story in New York magazine about how David Zaslav, the CEO of Warner Brothers Discovery, which owns CNN, has approached the White House about steps they can take to get back on Trump's good side. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1876.8799999999999s)]
*  Yes, include. Yes, including a fishing show with Don Jr. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1892.1599999999999s)]
*  Because they want more conservative voices. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1895.44s)]
*  But they have one. They have one in mind. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1897.04s)]
*  Yeah, they had a list. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1898.8s)]
*  Apparently had a list. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1899.8s)]
*  And it was just Don Jr. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1900.6799999999998s)]
*  We spent years of worrying about what corporate consolidation in media would mean for journalistic independence. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1902.28s)]
*  But it was in a world in which people took for granted that the federal government would not use politics to make those decisions. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1908.32s)]
*  There was ideological differences on mergers. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1916.3999999999999s)]
*  There was there. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1919.48s)]
*  There are different schools of thought about whether or not allowing these big consolidations should should be as good or bad for consumers in the country. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1920.6399999999999s)]
*  But the idea that just direct political interference in these kinds of decisions just wasn't part of the equation when when all of a sudden CNN was being picked up by conglomerates and and and all these companies when when when Warner Brothers Discovery were merging. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1928.24s)]
*  And now we're watching these companies have to capitulate. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1945.68s)]
*  I do think that like Harvard fighting back, some of the law firms fighting back is showing a path. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1948.56s)]
*  ABC capitulating makes it harder for CBS to fight. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1954.1599999999999s)]
*  If CBS capitulated, capitulates, it will make it harder for the next one. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1957.72s)]
*  We are in a very dangerous moment. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1961.24s)]
*  And I want to go back. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1962.8799999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump saying today in the Oval, I want to follow the law. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1965.1999999999998s)]
*  You know, look, I was deport people, but I want to follow the law. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1968.6399999999999s)]
*  I love and respect the Supreme Court. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1970.8s)]
*  This is Donald Trump. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1972.56s)]
*  He has gone so far, but he is still learning what he can and cannot get away with. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1974.52s)]
*  He really is. He is he is the greatest lie about Donald Trump is that he doesn't respond to incentives. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1979.1599999999999s)]
*  He does. And if CBS capitulates, he will have learned that these tactics works. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1984.36s)]
*  These law firms capitulating has taught him that those tactics work when when Columbia does it, they go after Harvard. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1988.48s)]
*  And so it is it is so like the stakes for CBS and the stakes for the country of them deciding whether or not to capitulate are so enormous. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=1993.28s)]
*  And I just hope that people inside understand that they are you know, if they if they they they give into Trump on this, they are the next in a line of people in the story of how we no longer had a free press. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2001.84s)]
*  That is what is at stake. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2013.1999999999998s)]
*  And just it's worth pointing out that this started with no one facing any threat. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2014.04s)]
*  It was a bunch of tech CEOs being like, oh, yeah, here's a million dollars for your inauguration. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2019.24s)]
*  Jeff Bezos, according to the story, someone at Warner Brothers Discovery reached out to someone in the quote Trump orbit to get advice. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2023.48s)]
*  And one of the things they pointed to was Jeff Bezos and Amazon buying a Melania Trump documentary for 40 million dollars, which is about 40 million dollars more than it's worth. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2031.1200000000001s)]
*  And what did Bezos get? A bunch of tariffs, a bunch of tariffs. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2042.6000000000001s)]
*  And so, but yeah, and like it just, you know, the source you could look at that sourcing and think Trump orbit, what does that mean? [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2045.6000000000001s)]
*  That's a little thin. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2053.12s)]
*  But also, you got to remember, like Trump runs his his extended universe like a mafia don, because the Wall Street Journal reported today that the guy negotiating all the deals between the Trump White House and law firms that they're pressuring to give what is up to one billion dollars worth of pro bono services at this point is Boris EFstein, who doesn't work at the White House. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2054.44s)]
*  Yeah, he is set up his own little whatever MAGA consulting shop. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2075.0s)]
*  And so you'll end up having Boris EFstein working one side of this deal, companies, law firms hiring like Trump aligned lobbyists to negotiate on their behalf. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2079.12s)]
*  Everyone's getting paid off of this. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2088.56s)]
*  And it's just it's it's it's mob shit. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2090.56s)]
*  It's just and it's a lot of people just making the decision to cover their own asses. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2093.44s)]
*  You know, and like, this is financially better for me or it's safer or I got to think about my firm or my college or my company. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2096.92s)]
*  And, you know, like, maybe they're right in the narrowest sense, but like good for Harvard. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2105.36s)]
*  And I really, really hope that sucks saying that. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2110.88s)]
*  I know I hate that. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2113.64s)]
*  Really? [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2115.24s)]
*  I wrote that whole place down last week. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2116.7599999999998s)]
*  I just I really hope that other colleges and universities who are going to get targeted like if anyone after Harvard now decides to give in again, they have just really undercut Harvard and what they're doing. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2118.32s)]
*  I hope this makes every all the other colleges and universities finally say like, you know what, Columbia fucked up. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2129.76s)]
*  Harvard was Harvard did the right thing. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2134.92s)]
*  And now we're going to like we're all going to fight it with Harvard. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2136.76s)]
*  And same thing with other law firms. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2139.36s)]
*  There's a couple of episodes of Sopranos where the guy that played Terminator 2 in Terminator 2, I don't think that's the T1000. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2140.5600000000004s)]
*  He gets in over his skis with some debt to the mob and he goes into business with Tony. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2148.32s)]
*  He has a sporting goods store because he's trying to save his family, trying to save his life. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2155.0s)]
*  And he ends up living in a tent inside that store. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2159.6000000000004s)]
*  Just saying that you're making a bad deal. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2165.1600000000003s)]
*  You're going into business with terrible people, especially the law firms, too. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2167.36s)]
*  It's like this is your law firm. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2170.6800000000003s)]
*  This is a clearly unconstitutional. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2172.7200000000003s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2175.1200000000003s)]
*  What? [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2176.1600000000003s)]
*  Who wants who wants a fucking lawyer from a law firm who doesn't think that who isn't willing to fight an unconstitutional order? [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2176.6000000000004s)]
*  No, the levels of irony are just so great. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2183.0s)]
*  It's like law firms refusing to pursue legal avenues to do the right thing and protect the Constitution. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2186.24s)]
*  Outrageous. Colleges refusing to stand up for the principles on which they are founded. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2192.3999999999996s)]
*  I was reading Rumeza Ozturk's op-ed that got her slapped on a list by the Canary Mission and swept up by ICE. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2197.52s)]
*  It talks about according to the student code of conduct at Tufts, quote, active citizenship, including exercising free speech and engaging in protest, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2205.3599999999997s)]
*  gatherings and demonstrations is a vital part of the Tufts community. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2213.48s)]
*  Really? Really? [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2217.6000000000004s)]
*  You think so? I don't know about that anymore. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2219.28s)]
*  Well, not according to our government. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2221.2400000000002s)]
*  I agree. And the other part of this, too, is what Trump is betting on is that he is scarier than these law firms clients. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2222.8s)]
*  Yes. He's scarier than the alumni. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2229.28s)]
*  He is scarier than the students. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2231.4s)]
*  He is that Trump is betting he is more to worry about than all the people who claim to believe in these values. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2232.96s)]
*  I'm just thinking about I had when I first moved to L.A. and I was starting out, I had an entertainment lawyer who would negotiate when I was doing scripts. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2240.48s)]
*  And I saw him. He was a little bit tipsy at a party. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2248.28s)]
*  And this is the kind of lawyer you want. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2251.92s)]
*  And he just said we were selling a script at the time. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2253.28s)]
*  And he just said, I love it. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2256.4s)]
*  We're going to pick him up by their ankles and we're going to shake him. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2259.2400000000002s)]
*  We're going to shake him. That's the kind of lawyer you want. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2263.32s)]
*  Now he's living in a tent. Yeah, that's the kind of lawyer you want. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2266.0s)]
*  You want a lawyer when they even when they're at a party, they're thinking about how they're going to shake down these fucking studios. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2269.56s)]
*  All right. Now, not these capitulating little fucking weasels worried about that, worried about their ex on mobile money. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2274.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh, boy. You got to shake them. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2280.52s)]
*  That was a good lawyer. He's a great lawyer. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2282.84s)]
*  Speaking of shakedowns, I'm going to get into the latest on Trump's tariff policy in my interview with Joe Weisenthal. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2284.96s)]
*  But before that, let's talk about the politics of how the trade war is playing out. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2291.96s)]
*  According to a CBS YouGov poll released over the weekend, support for Trump's handling of the economy and inflation continues to slide. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2296.0s)]
*  A few notable numbers from the poll. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2303.2s)]
*  Seventy five percent of respondents said the short term impact of tariffs will be rising prices. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2305.12s)]
*  Sixty three percent dislike Trump's approach to trade, even though a bare majority does support its stated goals. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2309.7999999999997s)]
*  That said, 57 percent of independents, as well as 84 percent of Democrats, nine percent of Republicans, said Trump does not have a clear tariffs and trade plan. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2316.08s)]
*  No shit. Latest example over the weekend, Customs and Border Protection issued a notice that exempted electronics like smartphones and computers from the latest round of tariffs. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2324.32s)]
*  But on Sunday, the administration said those exemptions would be temporary. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2334.1600000000003s)]
*  Trump himself said that, quote, there was no tariff exception announced on Friday and added these products are subject to the existing 20 percent fentanyl tariffs. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2337.76s)]
*  You always want to put a fentanyl tariff on your phone and they are just moving to a different tariff bucket. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2347.0800000000004s)]
*  Then on Sunday, Trump said the tariffs on semiconductors are coming, quote, very soon. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2352.2799999999997s)]
*  And in his meeting with Bukele on Monday, said there will be some short lived exceptions for car parts. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2356.2799999999997s)]
*  If you're confused, you're not alone. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2361.68s)]
*  Here are just a few of Trump's top economic advisors on the Sunday shows, as well as Trump himself on Monday. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2363.2799999999997s)]
*  Those tariffs are temporarily off, but they're going to be coming right back on in another form in a month or so. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2369.7599999999998s)]
*  Or what are you saying? Correct. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2376.0s)]
*  That's right. That's right. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2378.8s)]
*  But 90 days could be a rolling deadline is what I hear you saying. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2380.08s)]
*  Well, I would not say that. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2385.12s)]
*  You want to call it exclusion potatoes, potatoes. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2387.12s)]
*  When people talk about the chaos or lack of straight, whatever, you just go back to day one. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2390.2400000000002s)]
*  Look, I'm a very flexible person. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2395.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't change my mind, but I'm flexible. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2397.76s)]
*  And you have to be you just can't have a wall and you'll only go sometimes you have to go around it under it or above it. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2400.28s)]
*  What in the lead time is on a new semiconductor plant? [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2407.3199999999997s)]
*  Three days, a couple of these. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2410.08s)]
*  When was the last time you think Trump touched his toes because of flexibility or saw them? [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2413.0s)]
*  He goes under, around, over. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2416.6s)]
*  We got the physical. He's doing great. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2418.9199999999996s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2420.12s)]
*  Our boys are healthier than ever. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2420.48s)]
*  6'3", 224. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2422.08s)]
*  DK Metcalfe stats ripped. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2423.3599999999997s)]
*  What do you guys make of the polling on Trump's tariffs and his economic approval? [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2426.12s)]
*  Anything surprising? [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2429.6s)]
*  One number that stuck out to me that I liked was who's responsible for the economy? [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2430.8399999999997s)]
*  54% say Trump, 20% say Biden and Trump with some smaller percentage saying or some small percentage saying just Biden still. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2436.1200000000003s)]
*  That's basically three quarters saying that Donald Trump is now responsible for the economy. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2443.88s)]
*  The honeymoon is over. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2448.2000000000003s)]
*  There's no more blaming Biden. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2449.48s)]
*  That's not flying anymore. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2450.76s)]
*  He owns what is happening. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2451.92s)]
*  He owns this mess. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2453.28s)]
*  He owns the high cost, the high cost of living. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2454.44s)]
*  He owns the failure to address problems in the economy. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2457.0s)]
*  67% of independents say the economy is not in good shape. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2459.84s)]
*  That is now on him. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2463.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2465.1200000000003s)]
*  I think that jumped out at me too. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2465.9199999999996s)]
*  I think big picture. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2467.2s)]
*  He still has North Korea numbers among Republicans like the whatever economic pain they're feeling when they look at their 401Ks. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2469.24s)]
*  They're not they're not blaming him yet or at least moving away from him. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2475.16s)]
*  I do think there's some real warning signs when you've only got 40% approval of Trump's handling of inflation. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2477.72s)]
*  65% think the tariffs will make the economy worse in the short term. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2483.16s)]
*  There are big majorities that think that the tariffs like over 70% think tariffs will primarily benefit corporations and the wealthy. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2488.04s)]
*  It doesn't seem like they've done the best branding there. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2495.16s)]
*  However, the voters are more forgiving when you ask them about the long term prospects of terrorists. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2497.3199999999997s)]
*  And as you mentioned, if you ask them about kind of Trump's goals versus how he's executing on it, [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2502.6s)]
*  basically, I think about 60% of the country thinks he's going to use tariffs to negotiate and then he's going to remove them later. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2508.96s)]
*  And I assume therefore they think things will be OK. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2515.08s)]
*  I continue to think that this is the this is going to be the high watermark for his polling on the economy and on tariffs. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2517.8399999999997s)]
*  I think what has happened is the tariff story has and a lot of the polling shows this has broken through like nothing else. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2524.2400000000002s)]
*  Right. Everyone has heard about this financial news, business news, political news. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2530.76s)]
*  It's everywhere. Right. And so I think people's feelings about what's going to happen to the economy are getting pretty negative. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2534.6800000000003s)]
*  But they haven't yet experienced the higher costs because the tariffs haven't really kicked in or the higher interest rate. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2542.1600000000003s)]
*  Like the worst of it hasn't happened yet materially to people's lives. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2551.12s)]
*  And when that happens, I think the bottom falls out at least for independence and maybe some Republicans. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2555.2799999999997s)]
*  Economically, what's happening right now is businesses aren't making decisions because they can't predict what's going to happening. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2562.92s)]
*  So they are not hiring or adding or spending or doing capex, etc. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2567.88s)]
*  At some point soon, businesses will start firing. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2571.92s)]
*  And I was talking to someone I know here in L.A. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2575.44s)]
*  who was working on a merchandise deal with an athlete and now is completely on hold in perpetuity because the socks were going to come from China. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2577.8s)]
*  There's a billion stories like that. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2586.64s)]
*  The great story The Daily did today about a small business owner who basically she imports a baby product from China right now. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2588.2400000000002s)]
*  It will be more expensive for this woman to import things she's already paid to have produced and to just leave them there. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2595.48s)]
*  There's a manufacturer that said they were considering moving to Canada to produce there. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2601.08s)]
*  Is that I thought we were supposed to bring manufacturing back. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2607.4s)]
*  Is that not what's going to happen here? [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2609.44s)]
*  Yeah, I do think also like the so I think the delta between the goal and the execution just talks about the way the chaos has really broken through for people. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2610.96s)]
*  The other piece of this is the stories have now kind of turned. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2619.48s)]
*  I'm interested what Joe has say about us, but the stories have now turned to OK, he stepped back from the brink on these crazy tariffs for the whole world. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2622.88s)]
*  But there's still 10 percent global tariff and there's still this massive tariffs on China that's having implications. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2629.72s)]
*  Let those implications the people companies directly affected the people being unable to figure out how to work around it. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2634.04s)]
*  Layouts all that will like take time, I think, to kind of reach people here. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2641.96s)]
*  Just like literally just like hear from a friend about somebody facing a consequence, because I think people in their mind think, oh, yeah, we got to stop trying to take advantage. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2646.12s)]
*  I think people believe that I believe that, you know, but I think seeing the consequences is different. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2653.16s)]
*  I will say just to be a straight shooter on the other side of this respect in both sides. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2656.92s)]
*  That's my busted out in a while. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2662.0800000000004s)]
*  He's caused an international economic meltdown. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2666.1600000000003s)]
*  He's shipping people off to a gulag by mistake. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2668.8s)]
*  He's rambling on the in the Oval Office for hours a day. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2671.0s)]
*  His approval has dropped from, you know, 51, 52 to 47. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2673.36s)]
*  Right. He's still like that kind of unmovable opinion like that is so it sucks. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2677.4s)]
*  It sucks. It's at 47 percent. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2684.8399999999997s)]
*  He's the worst president we've ever had. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2687.08s)]
*  He's caused a fucking self-inflicted wound that may have decades long consequences for for our leadership in the global economy. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2689.24s)]
*  And he's at 47 percent. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2696.52s)]
*  I will say it's April. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2697.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And at this time in Biden's term, you know, his staff was talking about the next FDR. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2700.0s)]
*  Why didn't why didn't Obama learn from from why did you know he's not going to repeat the mistakes of Barack [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2708.04s)]
*  Obama? He's the greatest president ever. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2714.6s)]
*  Listen, and his approval rating was much, much higher than this. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2716.96s)]
*  But I saw someone that the the Biden slide in his approval rating that happened around the withdrawal of Afghanistan. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2720.72s)]
*  Like Trump is facing that slide, that level of slide right now. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2729.12s)]
*  I just want. Yes. And I that's I agree. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2732.8399999999997s)]
*  I hope it is the high watermark. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2735.2799999999997s)]
*  But him living at 47 percent is just a reason to be like a little bit just just cautious about overinterpreting the results right now. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2736.88s)]
*  And I do. And I was saying, I do think that interpretation from your average American who is not a political junkie like all of us is don't love the news about Donald Trump right now. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2744.7599999999998s)]
*  Don't love the tariff stuff. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2756.88s)]
*  The same thing. Maybe some of the deportation stuff a little weird, but I like deporting criminals and stuff. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2758.3199999999997s)]
*  But I don't know. It's a few months. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2763.96s)]
*  Give him a little more time. See what happens. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2765.64s)]
*  Let's see. Let's see how I think that's what they're thinking. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2767.48s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. So before we get to my conversation with Joe Weisenthal, we've got to end today's news block with a corrupt date. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2769.88s)]
*  That's our awesome name for a recurring segment on all the latest Trump family corruption news. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2778.36s)]
*  It's really wearing well, I think. Sure. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2783.92s)]
*  I think it's here to stay. It was the best of the list of options that we had. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2785.8s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Today's item is a Wall Street Journal report about the shady crypto exchange Binance, which pleaded guilty to money laundering charges in 2023. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2788.76s)]
*  Since then, Binance has been banned from the U.S. market and has special government monitors making sure it's not money laundering again. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2798.4s)]
*  But here's the Journal headline. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2805.56s)]
*  Binance seeks to curb U.S. oversight while in deal talks with Trump's crypto company. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2807.32s)]
*  The Journal found that execs from Binance met with Treasury officials last month about getting rid of the monitors and returning to the U.S. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2813.4s)]
*  market, even as it's considering listing a so-called stablecoin from World Liberty Financial, which is a Trump family moneymaking endeavor. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2819.88s)]
*  The Journal says that this scheme could make billions for the Trump family. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2827.72s)]
*  Tommy, could you help decode the terms here and any sense of how bad this could potentially be? [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2831.88s)]
*  I mean, it's just think about what's happening. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2836.68s)]
*  It's not just that the Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump, the Binance folks were meeting with the Treasury Department to talk about loosening oversight of their company while exploring this deal with the Trump administration. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2838.72s)]
*  There the Trump administration has also talked about taking a stake in the Binance U.S. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2848.88s)]
*  operations and the crime that Binance was accused of was like money laundering by Iran on its platform, terrorist organizations using it, other criminal organizations. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2855.6400000000003s)]
*  Like it was it was a massive amount of money laundering happening. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2868.4s)]
*  And the fine they paid was four point three billion dollars. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2872.8s)]
*  The CEO went to jail for four months and now CZ, the founder of Binance. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2875.44s)]
*  But not in El Salvador. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2879.36s)]
*  Not in El Salvador. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2880.44s)]
*  Not bad enough for that, even though terrorist financing was part of it. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2881.36s)]
*  In the U.S. So, you know, the CZ, the founder wants a pardon. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2883.92s)]
*  They want to get rid of restrictions on Binance from the U.S. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2887.6000000000004s)]
*  government. And according to a bunch of news reports, Binance looked at the treatment of another crypto founder named Justin Sun, who quote unquote invested about seventy five million dollars into World Liberty Financial, which is the Trump [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2890.36s)]
*  administration's Trump family's crypto company. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2903.8s)]
*  And then, wow, who would you think it? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2906.76s)]
*  The SEC paused their fraud investigation to Justin Sun. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2909.4s)]
*  So there's just this very clear way you can work with the Trump family organization to get not only regulatory relief, but even personal legal relief for the leaders of these companies. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2912.92s)]
*  And all of that's on top of the Trump family launching the meme coin right before the inauguration, which basically allows anyone to funnel money into his pocket. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2924.5600000000004s)]
*  Because every time you buy a Trump coin or Melania coin, fees go to the Trump organization and they're collecting hundreds of millions of dollars worth of fees. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2932.0s)]
*  So there's just this like there's this whole set of crypto specific deregulation that's happening. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2939.7200000000003s)]
*  The SEC is dropping investigation to the crypto companies. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2946.2s)]
*  DOJ announced it wouldn't be enforcing certain money laundering cases on crypto. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2949.12s)]
*  It's just a very it's like something we shall be watching both in terms of how people can funnel money to Trump, but also future consumer harm because a lot of these companies are pretty fucking shady. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2954.3199999999997s)]
*  The I'm sure Crypto's are David Sacks has a handle on it. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2965.44s)]
*  We should just assume that people are bribing Trump, that they're putting money into his account. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2969.48s)]
*  Part of this ties back into tariffs. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2973.8799999999997s)]
*  We are now in the what what industries and what companies specifically get exemptions phase. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2975.8399999999997s)]
*  Trump loves this. Tim Cook, desperate to have exemptions for iPhones. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2980.8399999999997s)]
*  Other companies have billions of dollars worth of business at stake. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2985.44s)]
*  What is to stop someone from just getting a meeting with the president, talking all about how good they are for the American economy and then just just have to show them on your phone that you made a transfer. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=2990.7999999999997s)]
*  And only two of you will ever know because there's no record. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3001.7999999999997s)]
*  There's no there's no paper trail. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3005.2799999999997s)]
*  And all of a sudden, the exemptions lifted. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3006.9199999999996s)]
*  Or you could just do it in the Oval Office in front of a bunch of cameras. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3008.6s)]
*  You know, they don't care either way. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3011.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, Bambondi certainly doesn't give a fuck. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3012.88s)]
*  The the the level of like it is just incredible. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3014.6800000000003s)]
*  The way in which Republicans in Congress do not give a fuck about how corrupt this administration is. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3019.2000000000003s)]
*  They are the problem. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3024.32s)]
*  And obviously, Trump is the core problem here. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3025.0s)]
*  But the fact that these Republicans have so just completely abandoned any sense of responsibility to the country, just no sense of obligation to their office, to their state, to to their country. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3027.04s)]
*  Taxpayers to the nation. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3038.4s)]
*  They swore an oath to nothing. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3040.08s)]
*  None of it. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3041.64s)]
*  You see, Marjorie Taylor Greene bought the dip. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3042.4s)]
*  What? [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3044.88s)]
*  She said it was a New York Times story that she she finally reported that she did make a bunch of stock purchases right after Trump's. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3046.44s)]
*  I mean, I have that in common. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3053.64s)]
*  That's a bipartisan problem. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3054.7200000000003s)]
*  They need to ban stock trading. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3055.96s)]
*  But you did tweet it. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3058.0s)]
*  He did tweet it. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3058.76s)]
*  Well, what did she buy day of? [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3060.04s)]
*  Yeah, the day of the rip. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3061.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3062.92s)]
*  I mean, like him tweeting 15 minutes before, like it's a good time to buy probably gives everyone who was insider trading because of information from the administration cover to do whatever they did. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3063.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3072.84s)]
*  Well, some people just had a feeling. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3073.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's just like the what about ism of like, imagine if Hunter Biden did this is so tired and so boring. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3075.52s)]
*  But this is just so much worse than any of the things that we read about him doing. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3081.6s)]
*  Like, yes, it was gross to get a retainer from a Burisma or whatever. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3087.4s)]
*  But like we're talking about billion dollar purchases in industries. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3090.96s)]
*  And these are not like long held Trump family organization businesses. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3095.2400000000002s)]
*  These are crypto companies. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3100.8s)]
*  They started right before the administration so that they could capitalize in moments like this. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3102.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3107.16s)]
*  David Foster Wallace gave a great commencement speech once about the importance of cliche. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3107.48s)]
*  And I know that what if Obama did it? [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3111.36s)]
*  What if Biden did it? [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3112.92s)]
*  And I know it's a cliche. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3113.56s)]
*  Maybe we got to bring it back. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3115.2s)]
*  We just got to stop. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3116.6s)]
*  Like, I know we all roll our eyes in it because we're so like hyper engaged, fucking broken partisans. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3117.32s)]
*  But like. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3121.84s)]
*  What if Obama did it? [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3123.88s)]
*  People would lose their minds. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3125.6400000000003s)]
*  We can't point that out anymore because it's cliche. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3126.84s)]
*  It's a good cliche. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3128.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3130.1600000000003s)]
*  If George W. Bush did it, we would have all lost our minds. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3130.6000000000004s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3132.76s)]
*  You know, and probably something would have happened. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3133.44s)]
*  I think I think what the problem with the the pointing to the Hunter stuff is like, it sounds like a defense of him, which no one's intending it to be. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3135.36s)]
*  It's like it's just pointing out their hypocrisy. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3141.52s)]
*  So so MTG bought between twenty one thousand and three hundred and fifteen thousand in stocks both the day before and the day of way to go. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3144.12s)]
*  Marjorie, way to be brave in the day. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3152.04s)]
*  But in the day before Trump's move, she also dumped between fifty and one hundred thousand dollars in Treasury bills day before. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3153.32s)]
*  Was she dumped Treasury bills? [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3159.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3161.04s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3161.36s)]
*  That's free enough cash probably to buy stocks if it if it dropped. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3161.6800000000003s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3165.88s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3166.4s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3166.88s)]
*  Yeah, I'm interested in who got out, who got out of stocks on Monday or when was Liberation Day Tuesday because we recorded Monday. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3167.56s)]
*  Like who got out on Monday? [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3173.96s)]
*  Got a lot of cash. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3175.6400000000003s)]
*  I was. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3176.48s)]
*  Yeah, she jumped. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3176.76s)]
*  She did. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3177.6000000000004s)]

*  But if you're all of a sudden, I was there for the pause buying a bunch of options before the pause. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3187.0s)]
*  Yeah, not before liberation. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3191.28s)]
*  Which which no one knew about because, you know, Trump said it was just they wrote it from their heart in the Oval Office the day of. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3193.6s)]

*  People are calling me up who normally don't call me up as I go okay that must mean that there's at a [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3463.0s)]
*  minimum a lot of volatility in the market. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3467.64s)]
*  Yeah obviously there's a lot there's a lot more going on than just that. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3470.2s)]
*  I want to start with your 30,000 foot view of where things stand right now. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3473.8799999999997s)]
*  We are recording Monday afternoon California time. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3477.96s)]
*  It seems as if the markets have stabilized a bit after the last two weeks. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3481.96s)]
*  But how are the business and financial worlds feeling about [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3485.7999999999997s)]
*  this trade war and and how it might affect the economy? [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3489.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah I mean I think at a minimum at a minimum there is this view that for a long time you know [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3493.08s)]
*  the quote rules they always say businesses want certainty the businesses hate uncertainty these [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3500.44s)]
*  are cliches but there's probably always some truth to why these are cliches. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3505.56s)]
*  At a minimum we're in a period of a high degree of uncertainty about what the trading relationship [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3510.04s)]
*  between the U.S. and the rest of the world is going to look like and at a minimum you would [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3515.64s)]
*  think that okay this is not an environment in which businesses are going to be inclined to make [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3520.6s)]
*  new investments open up new factories open up new locations expand headcount etc. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3525.96s)]
*  It's I think the general perception is it's worse than that so right so that would be the minimum [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3531.88s)]
*  is that you have this sort of period of uncertainty where there's no new expansion but you know you [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3537.0s)]
*  have the hit to the stock market you have major new costs coming through I mean this is something [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3541.64s)]
*  of an instantaneous supply shock probably not quite on the order of the COVID supply shock but [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3547.24s)]
*  a supply shock nonetheless you have the rise in interest rates that we've seen over the last [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3553.8799999999997s)]
*  several days that's going to affect borrowing costs it's going to affect the housing market [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3559.72s)]
*  that's going to affect the car market other areas of corporate finance so that probably has a [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3563.56s)]
*  tightening and negative effect on actual activity so it's really not just it's not just a market [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3568.04s)]
*  story even though you know everyone's watching the charts on their screen that's sort of what's [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3574.2s)]
*  getting the immediate attention because we really haven't had like the hard data so-called hit that [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3578.6s)]
*  really shows what's been going on in the economy over the last few weeks. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3584.2s)]
*  Trump's top economic advisor in the White House Kevin Hassett he was on Fox today saying that there's [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3586.92s)]
*  no chance at all of a recession happening in 2025 is that believable to you? [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3593.48s)]
*  Yeah I mean I don't know how anyone could say that ever I mean in any condition right in any [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3598.6s)]
*  condition I don't know how anyone could ever say there's no chance at all happening and when you [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3602.68s)]
*  look at just the just the degree of tightening that we've gotten in financial markets and by [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3607.64s)]
*  tightening I mean like if you're issuing equity that's gotten more expensive because the price [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3613.08s)]
*  has gone down if you're issuing credit not only have you seen yields rise you've seen credit [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3616.8399999999997s)]
*  spreads rise and just the higher costs of all kinds of inputs and then the sort of negativity [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3622.6s)]
*  that's in you know out in the you know out in the ether out in the media it's hard for me to believe [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3629.72s)]
*  that there is literally no chance at all of a recession even you know I would say actually [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3635.8799999999997s)]
*  there are a lot of people there are some people who think that a recession has started already [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3641.48s)]
*  right. Larry Fink the CEO of Blackstone said I think about a week and a half ago that the CEOs [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3645.7999999999997s)]
*  he talks to think the recession has already begun. Charlie Gasparino who works for Fox Business said [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3652.4399999999996s)]
*  he talks to CEOs who think that a recession is either imminent or has perhaps already begun. If [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3658.28s)]
*  you look at the betting markets you know there's like at least a 50-50 percent chance according to [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3663.5600000000004s)]
*  people with money on the line that a recession has begun so the idea that there's no chance at all of [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3668.0400000000004s)]
*  a recession in 2025 strikes me as a little bit implausible. I'm a little confused about how the [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3672.6800000000003s)]
*  markets are reacting to the news that smartphones and other electronics are currently exempt from [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3677.96s)]
*  Trump's tariffs on China which was quickly followed by Trump and some of his staff saying [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3684.52s)]
*  actually they're still subjected to the 20 percent fentanyl tariffs and will probably be subjected [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3689.8s)]
*  to additional tariffs targeted at the semiconductor industry and electronic supply chains. What did [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3694.52s)]
*  you make of all that and the and the market reaction to that today? I mean there's an [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3699.88s)]
*  extraordinary amount of uncertainty obviously I mean look I guess the market presumes that there [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3703.4s)]
*  is not going to be 145 percent tariffs on iPhones. That seems like okay it's not going to be that big [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3709.16s)]
*  which maybe some people thought that was going to be and you know that would just be an eye popping [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3717.0s)]
*  a staggering number. I mean the important thing is that a lot of the action if you look in the [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3723.0s)]
*  market really took place before April 2nd before so-called liberation day and so you know it's like [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3727.96s)]
*  Apple is a $202 stock this is the time we're talking about this. It had been over 240 in [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3736.2000000000003s)]
*  late February so already a lot of the anxiety from this trade war was getting baked into the market [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3742.76s)]
*  even before we review the actual formal numbers which seem to seem very uncertain were revealed. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3748.6800000000003s)]
*  How big of a deal do you think it is that China is now trying to halt exports of rare earth minerals [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3755.48s)]
*  to the U.S.? You know what I'm really glad you asked that question because I would just say [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3761.4s)]
*  I will do a plug for my own podcast ODLOTS which we have an episode that will come out [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3766.6s)]
*  Tuesday morning. I'm not sure when this will come out. Tuesday morning. We actually on this question [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3772.04s)]
*  exactly so here's the good news here's the good news it's not that big of a deal. It turns out [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3776.92s)]
*  they're not that rare they're not that much it turns out and I didn't know this up until we [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3783.32s)]
*  talked to our own colleague who really knows this stuff the number one use of so-called rare [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3787.64s)]
*  earth metals is actually in vacuum cleaners in the worst comes yeah I know this it sounds really [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3792.92s)]
*  scary where your earth metals or China has control of them it turns out this is not that of all the [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3799.24s)]
*  big deals that are out there in the world and there are many this is one that like people can [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3804.92s)]
*  probably chill out about in the worst case scenario they say like oh yeah this is using like missile [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3810.04s)]
*  tech or whatever in the worst case scenario maybe people will come around and ask to like buy your [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3814.92s)]
*  vacuum cleaner your Dyson vacuum cleaner from you and so that they can extract the metal but this [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3819.88s)]
*  is probably one thing that'll be okay well let's talk about the trade war with China at large [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3824.76s)]
*  because it does seem like regardless of you know what Trump backs off or what he doesn't that that [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3829.32s)]
*  trade war is is here to stay at least for the foreseeable future if that's the case could you [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3835.32s)]
*  talk about what that will mean for most Americans and our economy overall yeah I mean like you know [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3840.36s)]
*  there's a huge share of goods consumption that comes from China and it's not just so there's the [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3847.1600000000003s)]
*  goods consumption obviously which ranges from all kinds of things from like high-end items like [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3852.36s)]
*  smartphones to like small plastic things that you would get in a dollar store like refillable water [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3858.1200000000003s)]
*  balloons and stuff and so forth there are a lot of small businesses I mean one of the reasons that [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3863.1600000000003s)]
*  this is perceived by some is perverse is that you have a lot of small businesses small manufacturing [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3868.36s)]
*  companies in instances who might buy some sort of intermediate good or they buy some you know piece [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3875.08s)]
*  from China that they reassemble and make it to something more expensive in the U.S. so it's hard [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3880.92s)]
*  to imagine that it wouldn't be massively disruptive that there wouldn't be companies that face some [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3887.08s)]
*  sort of existential threat threat to their ongoing viability from what are truly like [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3893.88s)]
*  staggeringly high tariffs between the number one and the number two economy in the entire world I [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3900.12s)]
*  don't you know it's a and in a short period of time you know countries undergo trading relationships [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3905.88s)]
*  and they rebuild their manufacturing sectors and this is the thing that happens from time to time [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3911.6400000000003s)]
*  in history you know they start off as small and maybe there's like one protected sector or there's [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3916.52s)]
*  export subsidies and stuff there's not you know there's not obviously some sort of you know social [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3921.24s)]
*  insurance to spread the pain from these particularly to small businesses who buy things from China and [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3927.0s)]
*  so forth so this is massively disruptive in a short period of time just with that in mind like [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3932.12s)]
*  stepping back from all this what would you say the Trump administration's theory of the cases yeah with [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3938.2s)]
*  its trade policy right now and I ask that question because there have been a few different [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3944.12s)]
*  rationales given some of which seem to contradict each other like what do you think they are hoping [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3948.76s)]
*  to achieve based on the policies you've seen so far and how likely do you think it is that they [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3954.36s)]
*  can achieve those goals you know they have said had revealed many different arguments for the [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3959.7200000000003s)]
*  tariffs right so one is it's oh it's about you know fighting the budget deficit some is it's about we [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3965.96s)]
*  need to rebuild a manufacturing base my guess is that you know there's various versions of it some [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3971.8s)]
*  of it is just that now all of these countries have ripped us off for a long time through unfair [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3977.24s)]
*  trading practices and therefore this is like the right way to redress years of wrong I think the [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3981.3199999999997s)]
*  main theory of the case though is that this belief that the US is an incredibly rich economy which it [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3987.4799999999996s)]
*  is which it is with a very strong consumer sector and it's so strong and it's so central to the [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3993.0s)]
*  global economy that other countries and companies in other countries should essentially pay for the [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=3998.6s)]
*  right to sell into the economy and if their economics don't work such that paying for the [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4004.44s)]
*  right to sell into the economy no longer is viable for them then they should set up a [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4010.28s)]
*  manufacturing base and I think there's probably this sort of part economical and part cultural [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4015.0s)]
*  impulsive like why manufacturing is per se important and I think it's important to also [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4020.52s)]
*  address that this is obviously not just a trump thing that a lot of politicians on both sides of [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4025.88s)]
*  the aisle we saw this under Biden obviously this sort of deep anxiety about manufacturing or the [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4030.28s)]
*  lack of manufacturing particularly in advanced goods we experienced it during COVID with all the [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4037.0s)]
*  anxiety around you know personal protection equipment and stuff like that it's not a new [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4042.36s)]
*  thing but I think there's this clear anxiety about the fact that you know the entire world [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4047.7200000000003s)]
*  really is so dependent on one country that's emerging as a manufacturing powerhouse in almost [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4052.52s)]
*  every category that you can think of. What's your best guess on what's going on with the bond markets [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4057.32s)]
*  and the weakening dollar? I think there's two things it's a really good question my co-host of [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4063.0800000000004s)]
*  the podcast Tracy Allouey has written a lot about this I wouldn't say there's two things going on [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4069.32s)]
*  right now it does feel like to some extent there is this general flight out of U.S. assets and so [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4073.0800000000004s)]
*  we have this sort of trifecta of the stock market going down the dollar going down the treasury [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4078.52s)]
*  market going down and so people look at the U.S. and they start to question is the U.S. a place [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4084.2799999999997s)]
*  where I want to park my marginal dollar and it seems like at least at the margins more people [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4089.72s)]
*  are answering no. The other thing with the bond market specifically is that we've had a few bouts [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4095.48s)]
*  of really intense selling and then in intense selling and it's happened a couple of times at [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4100.2s)]
*  night you know like during the overnight futures etc there's not a lot of liquidity in the market [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4105.32s)]
*  and when people are panicking they want dollars you know they want to pay the bills I always joke [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4110.2s)]
*  you know it's like you have to pay your rent you have to pay your cell phone bill all these things [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4114.12s)]
*  become very immediate it doesn't matter you can't you know I can't pay my mortgage with a treasury [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4118.679999999999s)]
*  bond I need actual dollars and so you just start the cliches you sell everything that's not nailed [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4123.8s)]
*  down you sell your desk you sell your headphones etc and so I think it's like rumblings of that [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4128.44s)]
*  where there's this like very acute sense of anxiety it's like I just want to survive to the [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4133.4s)]
*  next day I just want to survive to the next month and treasuries are one of the things in the menu [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4137.72s)]
*  of things that you can sell treasuries are one of the things that's available to you. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4143.0s)]
*  So you think it remains to be seen whether this is a consequence of the instability we're facing [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4146.52s)]
*  right now or a longer term trend away from the U.S. based on just the unpredictability of the [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4155.08s)]
*  Trump administration's policies? Yeah I mean look I do think it's probably too early to say but you [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4162.04s)]
*  know look there are other signs of it too of this sort of like you know the U.S. is turning away [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4168.44s)]
*  from the rest of the world in sort of very straightforward ways that's what tariffs do [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4173.4800000000005s)]
*  and you see various ways that the rest of the world is turning away from the U.S. you see it [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4177.4800000000005s)]
*  in the drop of you know I tend not to put a ton of stock in like polls of how people think about the [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4182.44s)]
*  U.S. at any given time but they're way down we see tourism way down from other countries already [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4188.68s)]
*  that's already hit you know today there were headlines about you know I think there's this [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4195.16s)]
*  hope that for example you know the U.S. could become have a good relationship with the Vietnamese [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4199.8s)]
*  for example and pry away one of China's neighbors seems very implausible to me China is going to be [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4204.92s)]
*  an important supplier and demand source for Vietnam and its future it's its next door neighbor there [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4210.68s)]
*  headlines today about China wanting its companies to deepen their investment in Vietnam so you know [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4215.5599999999995s)]
*  I think you look at Europe you saw the prime minister of Spain already talking about deepening [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4221.48s)]
*  its relationship with China and so forth so I think there's certainly a risk that just as we're [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4226.12s)]
*  turning away from the rest of the world that the rest of the world like refixes relationship with [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4232.2s)]
*  us because you follow this you know every second of the day you've seen all the yeah the headlines [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4235.719999999999s)]
*  and all there's a lot you know there's I'd say there's been a fair amount of panic or at least [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4241.4s)]
*  people making you know proclamations that like this is this reminds me of COVID or this reminds me of [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4246.759999999999s)]
*  2007 and eight or this reminds me like where are you on the scale of like this is a development [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4252.28s)]
*  that we should really be concerned about or maybe this is just you know just some instability now [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4261.16s)]
*  and things will level out you know I started my career as a financial journalist in 2008 October [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4267.8s)]
*  2008 specifically so you know the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the failure of authorities [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4273.320000000001s)]
*  then to sort of like stem that major bank run was to always to my mind the sort of defining event of [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4278.28s)]
*  my career and you know I always thought it would be and COVID for a second seemed like it could be [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4284.2s)]
*  that as well but you know then obviously there was a pretty forceful economic response and I like [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4291.400000000001s)]
*  a lot of people were surprised to some extent the degree to which something resembling normalcy or [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4297.56s)]
*  something resembling the pre-COVID life came back to the pre-COVID economy and it actually came back [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4303.56s)]
*  extremely fast this feels really different to me because this feels really different than 2008 and [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4310.6s)]
*  I think it's certainly plausible that it's a bigger deal than 2008 I don't know if it's going [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4316.04s)]
*  to be a bigger deal in terms of like unemployment per se because I don't you know it's a different [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4320.360000000001s)]
*  it's different but the idea you know this is seems like one of those bells that's hard to [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4327.240000000001s)]
*  unring because even you know the tariffs are still here they don't seem like they're going anywhere [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4331.88s)]
*  in theory the tariffs could be totally reversed but it's hard to imagine the president credibly [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4336.360000000001s)]
*  committing to never using them again right this is the problem he could completely reverse the [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4342.280000000001s)]
*  tariffs tomorrow and then he could reverse himself the next day and so I think people have really [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4347.88s)]
*  woken up to this idea that like the relationship that the U.S. will have to the rest of the world [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4353.56s)]
*  that you know to some extent had just been taken for granted for better or worse [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4359.8s)]
*  for over the last you know several decades may not be the same again yeah and that's something [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4364.200000000001s)]
*  that could could outlast Trump and I don't think that's really sunk in yet yeah yeah it's definitely [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4369.88s)]
*  look you know Trump really you know maybe the word is credit but you know it was his administration [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4374.6s)]
*  in 2016 that sort of heightened this anxiety about China in general and then there was a lot [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4382.12s)]
*  of carry through to the Biden administration I remember like the 2020 primaries like wondering [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4387.48s)]
*  and with candidates are you going to keep the then existing China tariffs and it was a remarkable [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4393.88s)]
*  amount of continuity in fact I would say like it was probably like the most bipartisan consensus [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4400.28s)]
*  of any topic I can think of is this view that we have to change our relationship with China that [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4406.44s)]
*  China is some sort of existential threat whether it's economically or perhaps military etc probably [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4412.599999999999s)]
*  one of the most bipartisan views that there is and you know I don't think I think by and large like [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4417.799999999999s)]
*  Democrats probably at this point would say no let's like roll back the tariffs but in general [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4424.679999999999s)]
*  right but I do think like the relationship with China is probably on some level never going to [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4430.76s)]
*  go back to even the sort of 2020 you know this even the Biden era environment yeah and I also [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4438.6s)]
*  keep thinking that even if they announce you know dozens of deals with all the rest of the countries [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4445.0s)]
*  to get rid of the reciprocal tariffs he seems like he's pretty intent on keeping the 10 percent [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4450.360000000001s)]
*  universal tariff and then it seems like it seems like these these China tariffs are also here to [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4455.56s)]
*  stay as well yeah and maybe you know the thing I keep thinking about you know and people talk [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4461.72s)]
*  about these deals and the White House is all these countries have lined up and you hear Wall Street [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4466.120000000001s)]
*  people like make a deal make a deal and now it's a deal and so forth and the thing that I keep [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4470.200000000001s)]
*  wondering about which I've never seen is like what is this supposed to deal even look like with any [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4474.52s)]
*  of these countries because the truth of the matter is you know that that chart that they came up with [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4478.52s)]
*  on like April 2nd Liberation Day who's essentially like this made-up formula like that was not a real [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4483.08s)]
*  measure of existing trade barriers and in a lot of cases you know they're like oh it's not just [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4488.36s)]
*  tariffs but it's non-trade barriers I think by and large that's perceived to be nonsense it's [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4493.88s)]
*  not obvious that many of these countries have a lot to like a lot to give us you know like I imagine [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4499.64s)]
*  sure you might be able to like sell some of these countries more soybeans or something like that and [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4505.8s)]
*  that's usually you know one of the things oh yeah we're gonna like we're gonna buy some more natural [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4510.76s)]
*  gas from you I could totally see that in some cases but there's not like a ton obviously that [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4514.84s)]
*  any of these countries can give and sure every country has some tariffs because every country [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4521.8s)]
*  has its own internal politics you know it's like why does the U.S. subsidize like ethanol or [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4525.96s)]
*  something yeah because of politics and so every country probably has their own equivalent of [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4530.92s)]
*  ethanol where there's like some industry that for political reasons has to be protected or is [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4535.8s)]
*  untouchable it's gonna have this or that but by and large I don't think most countries that we [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4540.68s)]
*  trade with have a ton of like obvious gives nor is it clear like what our asks are in many of these [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4545.24s)]
*  cases so I'm like kind of skeptical about this idea that there's going to be this parade of deals [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4551.4800000000005s)]
*  coming that like can bring down the tariffs now of course it's always possible that countries could [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4557.4800000000005s)]
*  give Trump almost nothing and he takes it as a win especially if he wants the market to go up [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4563.16s)]
*  all of that is like certainly possible of course yeah and I would say maybe even plausible [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4568.44s)]
*  what's gonna happen yeah Joe Weisenthal thank you so much for for joining and thanks for for all [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5xeBBx-qJs&t=4574.5199999999995s)]
