Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# How Donald Trump Defeated Kamala Harris in the 2024 Presidential Election
**Pod Save America:** [November 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4)
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm John Fafero. I'm John Lovett. I'm Dan Pfeiffer. Tommy Vitor. So guys [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=0.0s)]
*  tough day [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=6.48s)]
*  Emotional support animal on my lap right here Leo's here [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=9.4s)]
*  Let's get to it. Donald Trump won. He won all seven swing states [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=13.4s)]
*  He's projected to win the popular vote by about one and a half points when all the counting is finally done [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=18.52s)]
*  Republicans will take control of the Senate [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=23.88s)]
*  Probably with maybe with 52 seats when all is said and done [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=25.88s)]
*  Sherrod Brown, John Tester, Bob Casey lost their Senate seats in Ohio, Montana and Pennsylvania [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=28.96s)]
*  Alyssa Slotkin, Tammy Baldwin and Ruben Gallego [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=34.72s)]
*  Seems like they're gonna hang on in Michigan, Wisconsin and Arizona [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=38.32s)]
*  Unclear if Jackie Rosen in Nevada will be able to hang on [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=41.68s)]
*  The House looks extremely close and will not be decided for a few weeks [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=45.36s)]
*  Until they count all the votes here in California, which often takes a few weeks [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=50.08s)]
*  Trump's win was quite broad [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=54.44s)]
*  He improved on his 2020 performance in almost every county among every demographic [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=57.24s)]
*  So a majority of the country that includes all ages races genders religions and political beliefs chose [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=65.16s)]
*  four more years of Donald Trump [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=73.88s)]
*  either because they like him or they like his agenda or [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  They don't see him and his agenda as enough of a risk or they voted for him based on [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=79.16000000000001s)]
*  Battery and complete information. Those are the options or they hated Democrats or they hate it. Yeah, and it's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=84.2s)]
*  Probably a different mix for each voter, but we just don't know yet [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=90.16000000000001s)]
*  One thing we do know is that since the pandemic [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=94.2s)]
*  in the record inflation it caused [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  Incumbent leaders all over the world have been losing incumbents of [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=101.16000000000001s)]
*  All political persuasions on nearly every continent and I just say that is a [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=105.55999999999999s)]
*  Factual background for context in the political environment win right now with all that said [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=110.63999999999999s)]
*  What are your thoughts on what went wrong? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=117.44s)]
*  on election night [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=121.44s)]
*  Or or in this election, sorry who wants to who wants to start Dan? Oh, thank you [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=124.24s)]
*  You were about to speak [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=130.88s)]
*  You were about to speak so I figured that was that was me trying not to speak but [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=133.88s)]
*  We're gonna get this moment. Anyway, so yeah, I [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=139.64s)]
*  Think you hit on the most important point, which is a brutal political environment [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=142.76s)]
*  Right, and this is the polling was telling us this for years now [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=147.72s)]
*  Three-quarters of voters think the country's on the wrong track [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=152.44s)]
*  Two-thirds are unhappy with the economy in the exit polling 45 percent of voters said that their [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=155.04s)]
*  Family's personal financial situation was worse off than it was four years ago [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=161.68s)]
*  The incumbent president has an approval rating of about 40 or 41 percent [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=165.24s)]
*  those are all of the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=169.72s)]
*  elements in which an incumbent party loses an election and then you add to the fact that our [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=172.32s)]
*  Nominee who I believe ran an incredible campaign under incredibly difficult circumstances has been the nominee for about a hundred and ten days [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=178.72s)]
*  I think and it was introduced to the public as a largely unknown figure despite being the vice president of the United States [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=186.88s)]
*  110 days to go against a [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=193.08s)]
*  Presidential candidate former president who was running his third consecutive presidential election [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=195.68s)]
*  he has been running for almost ten years now straight and she had to try to mount a campaign in 109 days and [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=200.88s)]
*  The campaign the country shifted to the right [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=208.68s)]
*  Across the board right and as you point out in every state except Washington State in Utah [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=211.0s)]
*  Donald Trump did better than he did in [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=216.72s)]
*  2020 he cut the margins by double digits and places in like New York, New Jersey [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=219.76s)]
*  Connecticut, Rhode Island the bluest of states and so this is a very big thing and there will be a ton of second-guessing and nitpicking and all [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=225.08s)]
*  Of that but we have to recognize the political environment operating in and the changes in the country politically over the last year [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=232.36s)]
*  And it's really the changes have been going on since 2016 that we were able to win in 2020 [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=239.32s)]
*  By a tiny bit, but we've been moving in this direction for a while now and it it came home in a really brutal way [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=244.68s)]
*  last night [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=250.76s)]
*  time [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=253.23999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I think Dan put it well the the one thing I just wanted to tell folks is just to be [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=254.28s)]
*  I really want to know what happened because I want the to do some personal soul-searching and the party do soul-searching to fix this and to [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=258.84s)]
*  do better next year [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=266.2s)]
*  And I think we just have to tell everyone that [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=267.72s)]
*  We're going to do our best to sort through the information that's available, but it's kind of [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=270.36s)]
*  Exit polls that are spotty at best. It's county by county data [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=275.0s)]
*  And in a few months, there's gonna be much more granular data that will almost certainly upend a whole bunch of the narratives that you see [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=280.44000000000005s)]
*  In the next few months about why Kamala Harris lost [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=287.24s)]
*  And so, you know everyone just approach this with some humility [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=290.36s)]
*  And so, you know everyone just approached this with some humility [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=293.48s)]
*  And and realize that anyone who tells you they know exactly what happened or why Kamala Harris lost or that it was [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=297.40000000000003s)]
*  The vp pick or gaza that did it or he did joe rogan and she didn't write like those are [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=303.8s)]
*  Be skeptical of those people [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=310.52s)]
*  I think [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=313.16s)]
*  Dan's point about the fundamentals is probably the most important one which was you had a right track wrong track number [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=314.52s)]
*  That was historically bad you had joe biden's approval rating that was very bad you had a candidate with 100 days to [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=319.88s)]
*  Introduce herself to the country [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=327.15999999999997s)]
*  And those are very difficult headwinds and trump was able to take the mantle of the anti-establishment [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=330.52s)]
*  Candidate at a time when voters were really really mad [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=336.34s)]
*  Um, and he could also point to the economy in his first three years in office and say [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=340.36s)]
*  Things were better than why don't we go back to that and that was a powerful simple message [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=345.08s)]
*  Yeah, I mean what I was thinking about this morning is [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=350.2s)]
*  Okay [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=353.8s)]
*  The case we made against donald trump [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=355.47999999999996s)]
*  Was true. The truth is the truth. That was a [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=358.28s)]
*  strong and valid case [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=361.24s)]
*  both [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=363.96s)]
*  Against laying at the feet of kamala harris the frustrations people have with inflation which was global which was following a [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=364.76s)]
*  once in a generation pandemic [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=372.76s)]
*  And the risk that donald trump would pose [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=374.76s)]
*  In a second term that case was valid. It was a case made broadly and what I think we have to figure out now is [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=377.47999999999996s)]
*  that millions of americans who [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=384.11999999999995s)]
*  agree with our concerns about donald trump who agree that that he has a terrible character that he has terrible traits for leadership, uh decided [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=386.03999999999996s)]
*  that [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=395.55999999999995s)]
*  their concerns about the economy their [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=396.76s)]
*  anger at the establishment was enough to justify taking that chance and [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=400.03999999999996s)]
*  There'll be a lot of reasons for that there'll be a lot to unpack about why that happened [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=405.16s)]
*  but what I was thinking about this morning is only [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=408.76s)]
*  As democrats made that case a lot of people didn't listen [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=413.32s)]
*  They may not listen because they don't trust democrats. They may not listen because the media environment is so [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=416.68s)]
*  Fractured that they either don't hear it or they hear it translated through a propaganda apparatus that makes it unintelligible [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=422.68s)]
*  Uh, whatever the reasons those are the places where i I I see places where we have to figure out [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=430.62s)]
*  Uh how to sort of attack problems because if the case against donald trump was true [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=437.18s)]
*  we all continue to believe that millions of americans didn't buy it and [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=442.46s)]
*  uh [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=446.86s)]
*  I think that points to the importance of investing in progressive media. I think that that [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=447.74s)]
*  Will cause some reflection about uh, uh how democrats speak to voters and who are our messengers? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=453.02s)]
*  But I think the details of that and how we think about that will uh take time to unpack. That's where i'm at [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=460.3s)]
*  I want to echo what tommy said about sort of definitive takes right now [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=466.38s)]
*  Um, the truth is like even when we get [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=471.26s)]
*  Uh, so just so everyone knows how this works, uh, there's two organizations one called catalyst one called pew [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=474.06s)]
*  and they [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=480.38s)]
*  In a couple months from now [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=481.98s)]
*  They will have the whole voter file and they will match up the voter file to the actual results [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=483.42s)]
*  And you'll be able to get like a really granular look at [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=488.3s)]
*  Who voted and why they voted and you can get you can dive into the demographic groups and stuff like that [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=491.5s)]
*  Those are almost always different than the demographic splits in the exit polls that we got for last night [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=496.46s)]
*  Which is why we're being cautious [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=501.26s)]
*  The even when we have that data by the way, it's still hard to untangle all this shit [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=503.42s)]
*  That's not gonna it's not gonna give us any easy simple explanations. So again caution, you know, don't don't buy a simple explanation here [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=507.74s)]
*  um [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=515.02s)]
*  Exit polls are I think useful not for which demographic voted which way [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=515.98s)]
*  They're good for sort of the broader questions about the attitudes among the electorate, right? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=520.7s)]
*  Which is you know, dan was mentioning how people, uh only I think 45 percent said that their financial situation is worse [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=525.1800000000001s)]
*  Only 25 said their family's financial situation is better than four years ago [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=531.82s)]
*  Also, 75 said in the last year [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=536.38s)]
*  Inflation has caused them either severe or moderate hardship [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=540.2s)]
*  So there was this big, you know, we've [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=544.8599999999999s)]
*  You've heard us debate this for years now [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=547.42s)]
*  Where it's like well [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=550.4599999999999s)]
*  Maybe people think that the economy's bad because the news is telling them the economy's bad and republicans are telling the economy's bad [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=551.74s)]
*  But really their their financial situation is great. Not true [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=558.2199999999999s)]
*  not true, uh [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=563.18s)]
*  Most people at least according to the exit poll and almost every other poll that we've seen in the last several years are saying no [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=564.54s)]
*  I have faced financial hardship because of inflation. Um, just a few other stats from the exit polls that jumped out to me [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=571.5s)]
*  So comal harris's approval [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=579.34s)]
*  Rating in the exit poll 48 51. It's a pretty good approval rating in in american politics today [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=581.18s)]
*  Donald trump's approval 44 54. So she was more popular than him [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=587.98s)]
*  um, and [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=593.1s)]
*  Were harris's views too extreme 46 said yes [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=594.54s)]
*  51 said no or trump's views too extreme 55 said yes 43 said no [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=598.22s)]
*  so likeability favorability, uh [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=605.02s)]
*  extreme [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=608.6s)]
*  Ideology these were not what defined vote choice for people [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=609.88s)]
*  Joe biden's approval rating 40 [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=614.54s)]
*  Disapproval 58 percent and then the second most important candidate quality who can bring needed change donald trump on those voters [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=617.4s)]
*  73 to 25 [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=625.24s)]
*  73 to 25 [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=627.32s)]
*  economic [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=629.24s)]
*  So again, again, we don't know exactly what the explanation is but a lot of it is pointing to [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=630.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, you had an unpopular president because of inflation and she couldn't overcome it. Yeah, I I do think that like [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=635.32s)]
*  you know [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=643.24s)]
*  There are a lot of and I hope nobody's paying attention a lot of people kind of [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=644.44s)]
*  Just as on the left. I think it is worth discounting people who are talking about how much this result confirms their priors [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=649.0s)]
*  I think we see a lot of people on the right doing all kinds of victory laps and ascribing this victory [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=655.0s)]
*  To their personal set of issues and reasons for their own involvement [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=659.48s)]
*  But as of right now and again, we will see this looks much less [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=663.5600000000001s)]
*  like a vote for trump than a vote against [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=668.12s)]
*  Uh people's frustrations with the current administration and the current economic conditions then it does like any kind of embrace of trumpism [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=671.24s)]
*  Or trump remaking america or any of the grand and sweeping conclusions that some would like to draw [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=677.64s)]
*  Uh [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=682.04s)]
*  One place you can [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=684.1999999999999s)]
*  Look for early demographic shifts is the county by county results because even if a subsample and an exit poll isn't enough to [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=685.7199999999999s)]
*  Make judgments, you know if there's a county that is heavily latino young. It's a college town, right? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=692.92s)]
*  You can start start drawing some inferences [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=698.28s)]
*  dan it does seem that um [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=700.4399999999999s)]
*  the trend that happened between 2016 and 2020 which is [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=702.4399999999999s)]
*  latinos, uh [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=706.74s)]
*  Trump gaining ground with latinos as he did between 2016 and 2020 has also accelerated again [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=708.44s)]
*  And that's again, not just from the exit polls. That's just looking at these heavily latino counties all across the united states [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=713.96s)]
*  Um, what's your take on that? Yeah, that seems clear [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=720.6800000000001s)]
*  I am I want to be very skeptical of the exit poll top line numbers for [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=723.48s)]
*  any of the demographic groups and be particularly skeptical of either the subgroups because there are these numbers going around about [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=728.6s)]
*  Uh, you know how trump did with latino men that you know how he did with black men [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=734.04s)]
*  Just the in a state in a state and then the second part is then when you get to states [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=737.8000000000001s)]
*  You'd be very skeptical of that too [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=741.64s)]
*  But if you look at as you point out you look at the county data. It is very clear that trump made some gains [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=743.16s)]
*  Over 2020 you look at oceania county florida, which is where i was out of orlando. It is 50 Latino 33 port-a-rican [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=748.36s)]
*  And trump gained about 14 points over his 20, uh, 2020 margin [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=755.48s)]
*  Look all across the heavily latino counties in the rio gran valley [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=760.36s)]
*  Huge shifts double digit shifts in those counties same thing in new mexico [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=765.1600000000001s)]
*  And so all across the board you're seeing it [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=769.24s)]
*  I don't want to say though that we know the magnitude of that [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=771.64s)]
*  We're gonna have to wait for the pew and catalyst data to truly understand that but it seems very clear that he made [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=773.88s)]
*  Significant gains and that and that's why you're seeing these latino heavy states texas huge shift new jersey huge shift new york huge shift [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=780.12s)]
*  We'll see what happens in california [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=786.36s)]
*  But if you look at the performance of the other states reason to be worried about a shift there [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=787.96s)]
*  And so like it is it is very real. We spent a lot of time debating [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=791.64s)]
*  This over the course of the last couple years like what was real what wasn't [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=796.52s)]
*  He made huge gains in 2020. He clearly made more gains in 2024 and [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=799.88s)]
*  That is electoral check made if those trends continue, right? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=804.84s)]
*  Absolutely at a presidential level and really a senate level too because it puts states that we need like arizona [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=807.64s)]
*  Texas eventually nevada if the trends continue out of reach and there aren't enough states to get anywhere to even sniff 50 [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=813.8s)]
*  Yeah, a friend of mine sent me some details from laurence massachusetts, right? So [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=820.2s)]
*  Massachusetts obviously not a competitive state not a lot of ads running there not a lot of field programs not near the border [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=826.04s)]
*  Not part of the complicated multicultural florida political scene [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=831.96s)]
*  Clinton got 82 percent of the vote in 2016 biden got 74 percent in 2020 harris got 57 percent [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=836.76s)]
*  Of the vote in laurence massachusetts this cycle miss laurence [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=843.32s)]
*  80 percent latino my cousin's a teacher there and that's a very laurence 80 latino [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=848.36s)]
*  So that tells you this sort of story and then you know that the cnn exits found [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=852.12s)]
*  Seven and ten hispanic voters said the economy was not so good or poor [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=857.5600000000001s)]
*  And 40 percent of the economy was their top issue [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=862.04s)]
*  So it seems like you know again, you're right dan we don't want to take too much from these subsamples [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=864.28s)]
*  But there's clearly a problem [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=869.24s)]
*  Of erosion of latino support in the party generally and there was a particular emphasis on the economy in the exits [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=871.24s)]
*  in an effort to not just [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=878.6800000000001s)]
*  Seek out explanations that confirm my priors here like can you guys think of another explanation? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=881.72s)]
*  aside from the pinch of inflation and the fact that their you know wages have not outpaced inflation in most parts of the country over the [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=888.28s)]
*  last four years when [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=896.6s)]
*  trumpshift is [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=898.66s)]
*  so uniform like [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=900.44s)]
*  Every every kind of county rural urban suburban like what what other what other explanation? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=903.32s)]
*  Are you guys thinking about are there any other explanations that we're missing here because I just it the fact that it's so [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=910.7600000000001s)]
*  Uniform and that it was in so many counties and so many across so many demographic groups [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=915.94s)]
*  Just makes me think that it's it's hard to pinpoint like one single issue that doesn't affect every person [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=920.44s)]
*  The only one is anti-establishment [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=926.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, we hate washington and that guy seems like the one who's going to burn it down [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=928.52s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's right and [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=933.48s)]
*  I want to be [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=936.52s)]
*  Yes, I believe inflation is the major driving force here, right? We're seeing it replicate all over the world [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=937.8s)]
*  It's obviously happening here as well [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=942.28s)]
*  There's a way to make that a crutch that allows us to avoid some of the tougher conversations because just the mere presence of inflation [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=944.12s)]
*  Does not mean that we should lose on that issue. We have better policies for it, right? [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=950.52s)]
*  And so we have lost trust as a party [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=954.92s)]
*  Across a wide swath of issues and we have to address that part of it because if the idea is this inflation has come down significantly [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=958.52s)]
*  It will continue to come down [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=965.0799999999999s)]
*  We can't just maybe but like we can't just bet on a lower price of eggs in 2026 is our strategy to take the senate back [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=966.68s)]
*  Right. We're gonna have to confront why people found trump such a compelling solution to that problem if we had just won by [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=972.04s)]
*  You know in a we lost a point here in the battlegrounds these points here [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=980.04s)]
*  That would have been one thing but when you see the shift particularly in the parts of the country where there was no campaign [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=983.72s)]
*  the [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=989.3199999999999s)]
*  Where we actually waged a campaign and ran ads [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=990.52s)]
*  It moved it's a hi. I have the stats here. Yeah in the battleground states harris underperformed 2020 by 1.6 points [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=993.88s)]
*  In the non-battleground states she underperformed by 3.9 points on average in a county in a in a in a state, right? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1001.88s)]
*  Which just goes to tell you something that like camp the campaign [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1008.4399999999999s)]
*  worked well [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1012.12s)]
*  Didn't work well enough [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1013.48s)]
*  But like it it the campaign mattered in the places where she campaigned where they spent money on ads where they organized where they knocked [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1014.6800000000001s)]
*  On doors they did better which tells you how bad the national political environment is. Yeah [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1020.84s)]
*  So I think that's important [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1026.76s)]
*  and then I also think you look at like the delta between [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1028.52s)]
*  Kamala harris and some of these senate candidates [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1032.84s)]
*  And how they ran their races even races where you lost like dan osborne or how far ahead john tester ran against kamala harris [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1035.4s)]
*  And you start to see okay [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1042.2s)]
*  There is to dan's point. I mean this is what I was talking about earlier like there is this [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1043.96s)]
*  uh [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1048.2s)]
*  you know [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1049.16s)]
*  There are millions of people who are just not listening to democrats. They don't either I think like years of [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1050.28s)]
*  uh of [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1056.6000000000001s)]
*  of [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1058.04s)]
*  Correct anger and fear about trump becomes kind of the noise of trump. I think that is a problem [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1058.8400000000001s)]
*  Um, and then yes, like how are we the messengers on inflation when people simply don't believe that we'll deliver? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1065.0s)]
*  And that's a vicious circle right because we've now lost power [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1071.72s)]
*  We're now even less of a position to deliver on what we claim would be a better agenda [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1074.84s)]
*  But like that's I think the the hard work we now have to do to to find places where we can build power and demonstrate [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1079.32s)]
*  um [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1085.96s)]
*  A reason to put trust in democrats just just off that point you made john [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1087.0s)]
*  I did want to address the elephant in the room here for like crooked media and pot save america, which is the entire [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1090.36s)]
*  Goal of this company after 2016 was designed to encourage people to get more engaged in politics [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1096.44s)]
*  And run for office and knock on doors and volunteer and after a result like last night [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1101.48s)]
*  It is easy to feel like did any of that matter and I certainly feel it too [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1106.6000000000001s)]
*  um and in my darker moments, you know, like wonder if [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1111.88s)]
*  Anything a campaign does matters in an environment like this, but I do think it's again worth pointing out that [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1116.68s)]
*  trump [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1122.2s)]
*  Did better in non-battleground states and battleground states which suggests that this stuff matters on the margin [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1123.08s)]
*  But more importantly look down ballot [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1128.36s)]
*  Because where you see democrats winning by very small part margins like alissa slotkin in michigan or tammy baldwin in wisconsin [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1130.4399999999998s)]
*  That is where years of organizing really did matter all of our donations to the wisconsin democratic party [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1138.52s)]
*  That really mattered and so [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1144.9199999999998s)]
*  You know, I I think [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1147.32s)]
*  It sucks right now [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1150.2s)]
*  Uh, I understand people want to throw up their hands and never be a part of the political process again [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1151.3999999999999s)]
*  But I I do think that people fighting made an impact. Yeah, and I think that's another piece of evidence [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1156.6799999999998s)]
*  that [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1163.8s)]
*  It this was an [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1165.08s)]
*  You know an economic problem and people blame the top of the ticket [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1166.6799999999998s)]
*  for [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1170.52s)]
*  Bad economic conditions and they don't necessarily blame their senator their house member their governor because we have [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1171.32s)]
*  Popular democratic governors across the country we had a bunch of democratic senate candidates who did well [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1177.48s)]
*  We have a bunch of democratic house candidates both the senate and the house candidates outran the top of the ticket, right? And so [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1182.84s)]
*  There are definitely questions. We need to answer as a party to like regain trust with people [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1190.44s)]
*  But we have we have democratic candidates in tough states who win [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1193.96s)]

*  I think the term trying our best [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1291.64s)]
*  Doesn't mean anything you've never done anything half-assed. I know well, there's no [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1294.6000000000001s)]

*  So [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1348.84s)]
*  harris had a great convention [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1349.8799999999999s)]
*  She won the debate impressed undecided voters and focus groups [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1352.28s)]
*  She closed strong [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1356.6s)]
*  Rallies were packed. Um [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1358.76s)]
*  Any lessons about the campaign or or thoughts about uh her campaign things they could have done better [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1361.6399999999999s)]
*  Uh assessments of the campaign that you know, either hold up in light of this result or don't [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1368.0400000000002s)]
*  I kind of want to hold try to hold two independent thoughts in my head [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1374.76s)]
*  One is that the political environment was such and the scope of trump's win was such [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1377.96s)]
*  That the idea that some sort of tactical or strategic miscalculation is why this happened is an absurd proposition, right? [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1382.44s)]
*  I think she ran wasn't a perfect campaign, but she ran a hell of a campaign, right? [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1389.16s)]
*  They were very smart people. They did the best they could under impossible circumstances [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1392.92s)]
*  Having said that [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1397.24s)]
*  I think we should take a step back not just look at the harris campaign, but the last three presidential elections [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1398.92s)]
*  And recognize it as a party [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1404.6000000000001s)]
*  We are struggling mightily to communicate and persuade less engaged [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1407.0800000000002s)]
*  voters [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1412.28s)]
*  We crush who happened to be the most economically vulnerable. Yes [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1413.48s)]
*  But we are we are not reaching them and that's actually borne out by the fact that [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1417.8000000000002s)]
*  On a day-to-day basis in life [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1421.96s)]
*  They are getting in the states where they're not seeing a billion dollars of democratic ads [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1423.64s)]
*  They are clearly getting republican messaging [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1428.2800000000002s)]
*  So I think we have to look at two things right and I don't have answers to it [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1430.68s)]
*  But we should be willing to have the tough conversations question all of our priors [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1433.5600000000002s)]
*  one is [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1437.8000000000002s)]
*  It's just worth noting that we've invested all this money in field [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1439.24s)]
*  Right. We have put together massive operations run by the best people in the party in three consecutive elections trump has done [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1442.5200000000002s)]
*  No field. Yeah, none, right the idea that [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1449.3200000000002s)]
*  I will not for one second believe that elon musk and charlotte kirk put together like a real [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1452.68s)]
*  Plan they did just they had organic turnout. I'm not saying that we did anything wrong [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1457.96s)]
*  But we should just like look at how things may have changed over the years like what we could do [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1462.68s)]
*  And the other one is communication right? Like how do we reach these voters? Right in trump's bizarre rambling? [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1466.8400000000001s)]
*  Speech last night, you know dana white gets up there because why wouldn't the head of the ufc speak at the presidential announcement? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1473.32s)]
*  Uh acceptance speech [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1478.6799999999998s)]
*  And talks about all the podcasts that trump went on the milk boys aiden ross all these people [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1480.4399999999998s)]
*  I'm not saying we should do all these things. This is not about doing rogan, but [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1485.0s)]
*  We're not on a day-to-day basis [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1488.6799999999998s)]
*  We are not reaching voters or a certain set of voters organically [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1490.1999999999998s)]
*  And we should spend a lot of time trying to figure out why that is and what we can do about it [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1493.48s)]
*  my primary concern is just how we are able to [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1497.08s)]
*  Take back the mantle of being the party for the working class because i'm worried that we've lost it and [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1499.8799999999999s)]
*  That democrats too often talk about politics is like an intellectual exercise and not a thing that impacts people [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1504.6799999999998s)]
*  but [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1510.36s)]
*  Uh to your point about you know dana white's speech last night. I do think sometimes democrats view [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1510.9199999999998s)]
*  Campaigns and elections as like a math problem where you stitch together coalitions and field and policy and then you win [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1516.5s)]
*  And like trump did some of that right like no tax on tips was like a discrete savvy thing to reach an audience [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1522.28s)]
*  And we know it was smart because comal harris then stole the idea [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1527.24s)]
*  But I think big picture [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1530.1200000000001s)]
*  Trump views politics as an exercise in dominating the narrative at all times [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1531.72s)]
*  And he's found a savvy way to do that that creates no friction for him, which is constantly talking to these right-wing [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1537.0s)]
*  Influencers podcasts youtube stars, whatever they may be and there was a lot of conversation about like joe rogan or no joe rogan [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1543.22s)]
*  But I think that's a little bit secondary to the fact that he is doing constant care in feeding [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1549.72s)]
*  to [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1555.8000000000002s)]
*  Shows that we've people who are listening have probably never heard of like dan bonjina or ppd or like whatever these shows are called [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1556.76s)]
*  But they have big audiences. They keep his base motivated and fired up fox news is the elephant in the room here [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1563.8799999999999s)]
*  But he helps them over time build out a massive powerful right-wing [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1569.64s)]
*  Media ecosystem that the democratic party just does not have like we run our stuff through the mainstream media [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1575.96s)]
*  Traditional filter we're getting better at you know kind of talking to influencers [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1583.08s)]
*  instagram lives youtube's sports podcasts, etc, but trump [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1587.64s)]
*  basically only did that um and and [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1592.44s)]
*  Managed to reach the people he needed to meet we need to think about [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1595.48s)]
*  Communications in a new way when you were talking about as democrats. We try to stitch together different things [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1599.14s)]
*  I thought you were going to go this place, which is [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1603.96s)]
*  trump has put together [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1607.08s)]
*  the most [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1609.64s)]
*  Diverse coalition that a republican president has had in our lifetime [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1611.32s)]
*  in this win [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1616.6799999999998s)]
*  And if there's one thing that we are seeing and we saw it start happening a little bit in 2020 and it's happened more now [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1618.04s)]
*  people's [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1624.52s)]
*  racial ethnic gender identity are not the most salient factors in their politics [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1625.48s)]
*  They're becoming less salient over time [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1631.8s)]
*  I'll say and I think that we as a party need to stop treating them that way the party this party cannot be the sum [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1633.56s)]
*  Of its identities and interest interest groups like there has to be a bigger message about improving people's lives [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1640.1200000000001s)]
*  the the idea for a while that like [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1647.64s)]
*  Latinos that only care about immigration or black voters only care about criminal justice reform or women only care about reproductive freedom like [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1650.0200000000002s)]
*  that's it's it's [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1657.3200000000002s)]
*  patronizing [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1659.38s)]
*  And it's just it's just wrong and we've got to have a message [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1660.5200000000002s)]
*  that reaches [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1665.8000000000002s)]
*  Everyone that everyone can see themselves in [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1667.56s)]
*  Because if you're just piecing different things together different groups together and you're targeting every single different group here and there [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1670.44s)]
*  You know, it's the message is going to get lost [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1677.32s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I actually think goes to what tommy was talking about as well because really like I think tommy is describing kind of two [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1680.2s)]
*  Now connected but distinct ecosystems one [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1686.84s)]
*  Is the right wing? [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1690.6799999999998s)]
*  purposeful political [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1693.62s)]
*  Media apparatus and republicans have invested in that conservative billionaires and wealthy backers have invested in that republican politicians [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1695.56s)]
*  uh really go on that are like supporting that right wing information system and [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1704.28s)]
*  But we a crooked have been trying to build something of a countervailing force to that but [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1710.28s)]
*  There is just no equivalent to the scope of what the right has then beyond that you have this sort of [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1716.44s)]
*  Right-wing adjacent less political [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1722.68s)]
*  Um set of shows the theovans and the joe rogans and a whole host of other shows and I think it's worth thinking about [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1725.72s)]
*  Okay. Wow. Donald trump was smart to go on those places because those were friendly places. I think it's worth asking [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1732.6s)]
*  Why are they so friendly, right? Why did those become places? [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1737.3999999999999s)]
*  Uh that were much friendlier to the right that that feel like they are part of some kind of a counterculture [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1740.44s)]
*  How did we give up that mantle right? Like that is an incredible trick that the right has pulled, right? [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1746.6s)]
*  They are somehow both counterculture and rebellious while pursuing some of the most old-fashioned and traditional [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1751.24s)]
*  norms and social values [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1758.2s)]
*  Uh that most people find puritanical and actually reject in their daily lives [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1759.8s)]
*  And so like how do we have that space that is a place where everybody feels comfortable? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1764.28s)]
*  Everyone wants to be a part of that doesn't especially kind of younger people [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1770.2s)]
*  We've talked about appearing on these kinds of podcasts and these spaces that trump and [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1774.68s)]
*  But I think it's also a matter of like what democrats say [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1779.56s)]
*  Yeah, and and how they say it and I think it's telling that we could probably [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1782.9199999999998s)]
*  I don't know [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1788.36s)]
*  List on like two hands the number of democratic politicians that we'd feel comfortable sending on joe rogan [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1789.48s)]
*  And I think that's a big [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1799.1599999999999s)]
*  look [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1800.9199999999998s)]
*  Donald trump he got through all those podcasts [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1801.96s)]
*  He was he was the best donald best version of donald trump for sure like jd vance, you know [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1804.52s)]
*  I saw some clips on him on uh, our next vice president [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1809.6399999999999s)]
*  I thought you were gonna give him a swirly in the middle of the thing [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1813.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he was pretty terrible [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1815.7199999999998s)]
*  But he was terrible in a different way like there's still we still have a talking point thing because we're all so [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1816.84s)]
*  Democratic politicians are still on message [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1821.8s)]
*  Which is a good thing, right? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1824.04s)]
*  But the way it comes across in a setting like that is like you have to be able to mix it up and you can't [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1825.3999999999999s)]
*  Be afraid [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1830.36s)]
*  That you're gonna say something that the rest of the party is going to come down at you because you said it the wrong way [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1831.6399999999999s)]
*  right [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1835.0s)]
*  And I think that's that is something that the democrats have to think hard about as well [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1836.2s)]
*  Well, people hate politics right now and we sound like politicians. Yeah, and well that that's the other so this is the other big [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1840.76s)]
*  challenge I think that the party faces and I think this is not necessarily just a challenge of our own making because [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1846.9199999999998s)]
*  We are facing, you know an authoritarian movement in in our country [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1852.44s)]
*  and [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1857.56s)]
*  So when you fight an authoritarian movement, the instinct is to defend democracy [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1859.0s)]
*  but and dan you've talked about this too like [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1864.68s)]
*  If we are always in the position of defending democratic institutions that most of the people in this country do not think are working for them [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1867.8s)]
*  Then it's not going to work. Then we're going to be the defenders of a broken system [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1875.96s)]
*  and [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1879.08s)]
*  And donald trump and his folks are going to be the ones who are going to they want to burn it down [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1880.04s)]
*  We should at least be the party that doesn't want to burn the system down but wants to fix it and wants to reform it [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1884.68s)]
*  I would say I 100 agree with that. This is you know, this is something we've all been screaming about since 2022 [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1889.96s)]
*  The harris campaign to their credit [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1896.04s)]
*  Did not adopt they abandoned they saved democracy messaging that was so prevalent in the in the biden campaign [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1898.04s)]
*  and but you have to go one step further and this was probably an impossible position for her to be in as the [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1904.44s)]
*  Sitting vice president to the incumbent president taking over the reins with a hundred some days to go [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1910.44s)]
*  Is we have to become a party who wants to reform democracy and that is getting money out of politics [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1915.24s)]
*  That it's very I mean, it's getting out of politics. It's dealing with lobbyists. It's dealing with court with the influence of corporations [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1920.68s)]
*  Like we have to take [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1926.1200000000001s)]
*  That on and that becomes easier in the opposition which is where we now are [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1927.8000000000002s)]
*  That's what bernie when when I interviewed bernie, that's one thing I said [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1933.0800000000002s)]
*  What do you wish people democrats were saying more here in the home stretch? [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1936.6000000000001s)]
*  He's like I wish we were talking more about money and politics [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1938.8400000000001s)]
*  I don't think we're talking enough about the corporate influence the uh, like [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1940.6000000000001s)]
*  what's [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1944.68s)]
*  What I had thought but we talked about this in the pod right before which was that well if the polling error looks like [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1945.8s)]
*  Uh 2020 donald trump could win all seven states the polling error looks like 2022 comel harris could win all seven states [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1951.56s)]
*  I I did think that the connection between [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1957.0800000000002s)]
*  You know freedom and democracy as abstract content on as an abstract concept [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1960.52s)]
*  Uh that you could connect that to reproductive freedom and abortion and that that would be real and tangible enough [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1965.0800000000002s)]
*  Uh, I did like that's what sort of my my hope was at least I don't think I knew but that was my hope [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1971.24s)]
*  I just think about like our experience knocking on doors, you know [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1975.96s)]
*  You talk about we can't just be the party of democratic institution. We have to talk about reforming them [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1978.92s)]
*  I just remember having this feeling we all talked about at the time that like [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1983.0800000000002s)]
*  when you're knocking on somebody's door [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1987.16s)]
*  And a working-class neighborhood in a suburb of las vegas and they open the door [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1989.24s)]
*  You don't say like hi [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1993.6399999999999s)]
*  We're we're here because we're trying to defend freedom and democracy and we're trying to reform our institutions [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1994.6s)]
*  You say donald trump is for a national sales tax. He'll make things cost more [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=1998.36s)]
*  Kamala harris will make things cost less and you get you realize in that moment just how how simple and to the point [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2001.6399999999999s)]
*  and kind of [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2008.2s)]
*  Uh and non-abstract you have to be and like I think democrats collectively on some level we know that but I think that our [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2009.56s)]
*  Instincts because I think our party is now the party of an educated [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2017.3999999999999s)]
*  Uh cosmopolitan minority. It's also a place where people I think instinctively [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2021.72s)]
*  Uh are intellectual and intellectualized politics and I think that is very dangerous and I think it comes across in a lot of how [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2027.6399999999999s)]
*  We sound I think that's been true for a long time. We've talked about it before it's not new [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2033.24s)]
*  But I think now we're facing in stark relief the effect at least in part of of that problem [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2037.3999999999999s)]
*  Just a real just a quick data point on the money thing [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2042.76s)]
*  Uh a new set of super PACs revved up by the crypto industry spend 130 or 135 million dollars this cycle including dumping [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2045.72s)]
*  40 million dollars worth of negative ads on sherrod brown's head in ohio [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2054.28s)]
*  That is an unbelievable amount of money a disgusting distortion of our politics [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2059.64s)]
*  By a few crypto billionaires like the winkel voss twins. We're talking shit about it on twitter last night [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2065.88s)]
*  It's a couple of the venture capital firms. I mean like this is [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2072.6000000000004s)]
*  That kind of thing I think [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2076.76s)]
*  Would offend everybody you know what I mean? [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2078.6000000000004s)]
*  Like 99 of the country is like that is gross and wrong and I do think that's something we need to run on [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2080.6800000000003s)]
*  And run against and brock obama. I think very effectively ran against money in politics in 2008 fixing [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2085.6400000000003s)]
*  It will be a much bigger problem. The other just last sort of piece [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2090.84s)]
*  That I worry about for the democrat party is we have to get back to being the anti-war party again [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2094.52s)]
*  We like again, this is my hobby horse four percent of voters in exit polls said foreign policy made their decision, right? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2099.08s)]
*  So people who say this was just a gaza vote. That's not true nationally. It's very true in some [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2105.56s)]
*  precincts in michigan where you saw [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2111.88s)]
*  donald trump winning arab american and muslim american voters and chill stein get in second place and harris taking third, but I mean people were [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2114.6s)]
*  offended not just by [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2122.68s)]
*  the war in gaza, but also [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2124.36s)]
*  Concerned about the amount of money the u.s is spending on weapons for ukraine [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2126.52s)]
*  uh, and we need to either think about a new way to talk about why that's important or why we're doing it or [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2132.44s)]
*  Refocus our foreign policy priorities, but I think you know [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2140.2000000000003s)]
*  You heard a lot of people say donald trump is going to be the guy who keeps us at a world war three [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2143.48s)]
*  um, and [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2148.36s)]
*  That is the opposite of the conversation in 16. Yeah, I also again it's like [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2150.2000000000003s)]
*  Democrats talking about you know protecting freedom around the world and people like but I like I [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2154.2s)]
*  Who is going to bring cost down right? Like like we're it's I don't so to me [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2159.64s)]
*  The point i'm only making is like yes [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2164.2799999999997s)]
*  I I think that what tommy's talking about is absolutely true [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2166.2799999999997s)]
*  But again a party that has trust on these economic issues is a party that doesn't necessarily feel [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2168.8399999999997s)]
*  Unable to make the case about why democratic by why supporting democracies abroad and standing with our allies abroad is ultimately in america's interest [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2174.6s)]
*  I think it's worth because you just say like oh it needs to be about the economy or more about the economy and it's so broad [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2182.12s)]
*  And ill-defined that it's almost useless to say that because I think the challenge here is like kamal harris did talk about the economy a lot [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2187.56s)]
*  but uh [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2193.16s)]
*  There's a way to talk about the economy and I think that and this is a problem that the democratic party has had like that predates harris [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2195.96s)]
*  Biden goes since we started in politics, right? Which is all the pollsters [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2202.44s)]
*  And the message testing people they test an exercise [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2208.04s)]
*  And the message testing people they test an economic policy and it tests really good and they're like, all right this policy talk about this policy [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2210.44s)]
*  It's going to test really well [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2215.8s)]
*  So then a candidate talks about the policy [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2217.32s)]
*  It's one line about one issue and we tend to think that our economic agenda is like a collection of like [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2218.68s)]
*  Lines and policies that poll really well and it's not a theory of the case [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2225.8s)]
*  Like and the theory of the case can be it doesn't it's it's it doesn't have to be ideological in one way or the other like [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2230.52s)]
*  Bernie sanders like you know what he's about when he's talking about the economy, right? [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2235.64s)]
*  He's talking about the billionaires and the millionaires in the corporations barack obama came up with a theory the case [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2239.64s)]
*  You know the the middle class was like the defining issue and there's wealth inequality and we're going to take on [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2244.52s)]
*  Corporations who aren't playing by the rules, right? [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2250.5s)]
*  Elizabeth warren has her version of it you could go on and on and on but you do need a story to tell [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2252.36s)]
*  Even joe biden I think in 2020 I think had a good a good economic story that he was that he told as well [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2258.2s)]
*  But you've got to you've got to have that story and like a collection of policies [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2264.6s)]
*  That look good in an ad that tests. Well, it's just like it's just not going to cut it. I think that's true [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2269.16s)]
*  I also think we are also suffering from [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2273.8s)]
*  uh a generation of democrats saying we're gonna [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2277.0s)]
*  Tax companies that bring jobs to america and stop giving tax breaks for companies a chip job overseas and a set of populist [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2280.12s)]
*  uh economic [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2286.84s)]
*  Talking points that we've been saying forever that people feel like haven't been [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2288.6s)]
*  uh delivered on and so I guess what I [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2292.92s)]
*  I think back to when we were talking about [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2296.68s)]
*  Whether joe biden should step aside and we're seeing these polls and we're sort of [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2298.92s)]
*  We we need a chance. We need a fighting chance to win this thing and I think looking back on it [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2303.24s)]
*  It was difficult to separate [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2307.08s)]
*  The flaws that joe biden had because of his liability around his age [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2309.08s)]
*  Versus the flaws he was going to bring to this race as an incumbent [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2312.28s)]
*  We just knew that both together probably spelled certain defeat over the past hundred days [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2314.68s)]
*  We watched as kamala harris slowly fought back from those low numbers to put herself in a position to win [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2319.4s)]
*  And we went into this seeing the numbers as being tied and they were tied for the last couple weeks [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2325.8s)]
*  It turns out looks like there was a polling bias similar to the one we saw in 2016 similar the one we saw in 2020 [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2330.04s)]
*  Uh smaller smaller but still a bias about a point or two in the swing states and maybe a point or two nationally [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2335.32s)]
*  Yeah, so two points nationally and I think what we have now seen right is that like whatever story she was telling [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2340.84s)]
*  I'm sure there are there are ways in which the campaign could have done slightly better. I have no idea [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2346.04s)]
*  But ultimately, I don't know what you could have said to overcome that [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2350.6s)]
*  That weight of incumbency, right? [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2354.92s)]
*  Because part of what we're talking about here is it doesn't matter what she said people didn't trust it [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2357.08s)]
*  They weren't going to trust democrats right now. And so and so what what I think we what we [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2360.6s)]
*  What we had hoped to see right is that could come on harris overcome joe biden's liabilities [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2365.96s)]
*  The answer is maybe she couldn't and actually what we needed was somebody who wasn't an incumbent at all [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2369.7200000000003s)]
*  That is not to say we didn't do everything we could and did the right thing in desperate circumstances to try to claw our way [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2374.6s)]
*  To some kind of a victory, but I think looking back on it now. I think that's what i'm starting to feel [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2380.36s)]
*  Kamala harris when she when this when this race started joe biden had a 20 point deficit on the economy [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2385.08s)]
*  He had a deficit on costs sometimes as high as 30 in the polling by the time this was over kamala harris narrowed [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2390.52s)]
*  Trump's lead on the economy to four points [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2397.64s)]
*  To four points like that is that is stunning progress and she did that in 109 days or whatever it is [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2400.6s)]
*  I keep saying or not. Maybe it's 100. I don't know but basically the number on [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2406.8399999999997s)]
*  Who do you trust more in the economy ended up is going to end up being the popular vote delta? [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2410.52s)]
*  It's like trump wins 51 47. Yeah, that's that's about what i'm. Sorry. That's in some of these states some of these states [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2414.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2420.6s)]
*  The thing with like maybe you're right. Maybe we don't know is what she was being asked to do was virtually impossible [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2421.56s)]
*  In the period of time when she did it [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2428.38s)]
*  And so we just don't know if we would have had a better chance [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2430.06s)]
*  Right, right with if she'd had a year to do this or two years to do it or nine months to do it [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2433.5s)]
*  Yeah, or if again the other counterfactual here, which we could we'll be debating sure time to do it [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2438.46s)]
*  Is like if after the midterms in 2022 joe biden announced that he was not running again [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2444.38s)]
*  And then you had a real primary [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2449.18s)]
*  And you had a bunch of candidates and you did the whole thing and maybe kamala harris emerges. Maybe someone else emerges but [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2451.18s)]
*  I do think it is harder. It was harder for her to separate herself from biden even you can talk about it [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2457.58s)]
*  Tactically the view answer obviously like broke through to a lot of voters [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2462.94s)]
*  We saw this in in in polls and she could have handled that differently [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2466.7s)]
*  But even if from day one she had tried to separate herself from joe biden [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2469.98s)]
*  There's obviously a lot of reasons why that's hard to do [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2474.14s)]
*  But she was the vice president to joe biden to the to the unpopular incumbent and you if if it was someone else [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2476.7s)]
*  That other candidate would have had to from the beginning in this primary this imaginary primary reading like [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2483.98s)]
*  Said that joe biden didn't do well enough, right? [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2490.54s)]
*  Like which is also something that would be hard to imagine at the time like joe biden says announces in 22 [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2492.38s)]
*  He's not running again [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2498.3s)]
*  And then gretchen whitmer and josh shapiro and kamala harrison they all they all run against each other and who's going to take the first [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2499.1800000000003s)]
*  Shot at joe biden and say we're from the democratic party at that point. Right? So that's what's that's what's true [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2504.38s)]
*  The thing look, it's all counterfactuals. We don't know I [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2509.42s)]
*  Will go to my grave believing that in the situation in which we were found ourselves with a hundred days to go [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2512.7s)]
*  No one would have done a better job than kamala harris did [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2518.38s)]
*  In this race. Yeah, that was not enough. That's because she was flying against [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2522.3s)]
*  Tremendous headwinds. Yeah, I think we did not grasp how how tremendous those headwinds [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2526.76s)]
*  Well, that's what I mean [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2531.5s)]
*  I think it was impossible to separate joe biden's unique liabilities from the broader conditions and the polls being just a little bit off [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2532.14s)]
*  Made it harder to see as well [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2537.98s)]
*  The other point too is there will be people that say oh she didn't do enough to separate herself from biden [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2539.66s)]
*  It is totally possible that we would have been sitting here right now [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2543.5s)]
*  She had tried to run away from biden it became the story is is she different from biden enough? [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2545.8999999999996s)]
*  And then the story we're sitting here right now is people trying to claim [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2549.66s)]
*  Oh, it's because kamala harris, uh tried to create distance from biden and it divided the democratic party [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2552.14s)]
*  And that's why we lost. I just think these tactical explanations are going to be are just people are gonna it's a choose your own adventure [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2556.46s)]
*  I because i'm older than everyone else. I worked for al gore when he lost [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2562.62s)]
*  I knew this and the critique at the end was that he did too much to separate himself from bill clinton exactly [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2566.2999999999997s)]
*  So no one fucking knows [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2571.8999999999996s)]
*  I think the thing that is true is that it was a mistake for joe biden to run for reelection [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2573.18s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, and that everyone took the wrong lesson from the midterms in 2022 [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2576.2999999999997s)]
*  Uh, or not everyone the white house took the wrong lessons from the midterms in 2022 and they didn't listen to obvious voter concerns about [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2580.54s)]
*  joe biden's age [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2587.8199999999997s)]
*  Uh an anchor at the economy and that does not in any way guarantee [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2589.3399999999997s)]
*  That a messy messy democratic primary would have led to a better outcome last night [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2594.22s)]
*  Um, but the thing about primaries that's great is it's where the rubber meets the road in terms of your message and your policy [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2599.8999999999996s)]
*  And your candidate quality and voters get to tell you with their votes not with polling [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2606.8599999999997s)]
*  Uh what they actually think? [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2612.4599999999996s)]
*  um, and [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2614.54s)]
*  You know, I I suspect we would have been in a better place [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2616.22s)]
*  Um, because if you're not the current sitting vice president, it's a lot easier for you to say, you know [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2619.98s)]
*  What I actually think the president's gaza policy is really bad [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2625.1000000000004s)]
*  Uh, and I will take affirmative steps to end this war or find other creative ways to put distance between yourself [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2628.6200000000003s)]
*  And the administration that is like just frankly impossible when you were the vp and now you have 110 days to define yourself [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2635.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and by the way more broadly someone would have said, all right [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2642.6200000000003s)]
*  My lane is going to be the lane where I uh rip the shit out of joe biden for not doing enough about inflation [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2646.06s)]
*  Oh, no, look, maybe that caught fire with people. Maybe that resonated with people like we just don't know [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2650.62s)]
*  But we were denied that opportunity to to fight it up. A lot of people are pretty scared right now. We're facing [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2654.62s)]
*  Another trump presidency [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2661.5s)]
*  He I we believe in what we were saying about him this whole election. It wasn't bullshit [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2663.1s)]
*  Uh, so we're you know, we're all worried people are worried could be a it's going to be a republican senate [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2668.86s)]
*  Very likely to be a republican house, though. Hopefully we can hang on. We don't know [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2674.4599999999996s)]
*  um, do you guys have sort of [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2677.74s)]
*  parting thoughts on [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2679.8199999999997s)]
*  Like what people can do because you know people are going to be coming up to be like what do we do? [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2681.74s)]
*  Are we going to be okay? What should we do? [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2686.22s)]
*  You know, I lost a vote once [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2688.7799999999997s)]
*  On a show called survivor [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2698.14s)]
*  And no, but there's literally an oh my god from the back of the studio here that uh, I think [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2700.22s)]
*  What I was gonna say is only uh, this was this was gonna be a joke [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2708.2999999999997s)]
*  But basically I remember when I no I can't do it now, uh [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2712.46s)]
*  One step at a time, you know [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2717.66s)]
*  Like we don't have to face every one of our worst expectations or concerns at the same time to figure out one [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2719.66s)]
*  day at a time we have [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2727.58s)]
*  weeks now between [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2729.58s)]
*  This election and trump's inauguration to think about the best ways to fight back [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2731.5s)]
*  I remember what I said after donald trump the first time and there are multiple [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2736.86s)]
*  places to put your concerns and anxieties that can make a difference we have to [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2741.34s)]
*  Think about how in the in the short term [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2745.5s)]
*  We blunt the worst impacts of a second trump term [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2748.06s)]
*  We have to think about the ways in which we can support organizations that are protecting vulnerable people [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2751.02s)]
*  And making sure that even as we try to fight [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2756.06s)]
*  Uh trump we are doing everything to protect the people that might be hurt [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2759.1s)]
*  and then the third is thinking about how to build political power over the long term to build a uh, [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2762.46s)]
*  a democratic party a progressive movement [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2767.8999999999996s)]
*  Uh that I think after 10 years of fighting trump look donald trump winning in 2016 was a great shock and it lit a fire [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2771.74s)]
*  And we've been stoking that fire for a decade and people are tired. I know you're tired. We're all tired [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2779.02s)]
*  um, but [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2783.8199999999997s)]
*  You know a friend of mine texted me this morning and said hey I need you to [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2785.42s)]
*  Tell me what i'm supposed to feel this morning and I said well [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2788.54s)]
*  I need you to tell me what i'm supposed to feel this morning and that to me was sort of the answer like [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2790.94s)]
*  When we started when we when we did this the last time crooked media didn't exist [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2796.38s)]
*  It was just the four of us dan wasn't there the day the morning after we pushed my car to the side of the road [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2800.14s)]
*  And when I came in this morning and I walked in everybody was putting on a brave face for each other [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2804.62s)]
*  Everybody was smiling and trying to be their model what they hoped other people uh would see in them, right? [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2808.54s)]
*  And I feel like that's that's where i'm at right now, which is somebody's texting me [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2813.74s)]
*  What do we do and and I need to help find them find an answer. They need to help me find an answer and [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2817.58s)]
*  Day by day, we will start to figure out how to respond but we don't have to take every single horror all at once [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2823.66s)]
*  yeah [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2828.9399999999996s)]
*  You asked me the first question here, which I objected to but didn't answer it anyway, um, and I immediately [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2830.7s)]
*  Defaulted to sort of an emotionally detached [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2836.2799999999997s)]
*  Response explanation for what might have happened, which is sort of you know, I know [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2840.08s)]
*  Which is I mean that's what I mean you get along so well, that's right. That's right. And [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2845.2799999999997s)]
*  and so I I do just want to say that [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2849.68s)]
*  I know everyone listening is angry and scared and heartbroken [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2852.96s)]
*  and frustrated and just in some state of shock and that [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2858.3199999999997s)]
*  We all feel the exact same way and are still trying to process how this happened. We obviously knew and said for [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2862.8799999999997s)]
*  Months that this was a coin flip election anything can happen [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2869.12s)]
*  but [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2872.4s)]
*  The scope at which trump won and the way he won [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2873.52s)]
*  Is shocking and it's scary because it says something about our country that we don't want to reckon with [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2877.44s)]
*  And we're going to spend a lot of time [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2882.2400000000002s)]
*  Talking in the coming months about the dangers of what that means and the kind of president trump will be [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2884.56s)]
*  And how we push back on it [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2890.2400000000002s)]
*  But I just want everyone who's listening to know that we feel the same thing [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2891.76s)]
*  That you guys are feeling right now and you're listening to us process it [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2895.12s)]
*  In real time on very little sleep and we're going to be [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2898.72s)]
*  In your ears to sort of continue through that process with all of you [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2902.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it's gonna fucking suck for four years. I mean, I there's no two ways about it and [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2906.96s)]
*  I I go to some really dark places about this stuff in particular last night, you know [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2912.4s)]
*  watching trump's speech and then laying in bed and thinking about [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2918.72s)]
*  About [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2922.56s)]
*  Watching him for another four years and the goobers he's gonna put in his cabinet and rfk handling health care [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2923.76s)]
*  It's just like it's it's horrific [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2929.04s)]
*  Um, and it reminded me of 2016 this morning. I got the same text [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2931.2000000000003s)]
*  You did love it of people being like what do we do? How do we fix it? [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2934.8s)]
*  And there again then there was no easy fix and now there's no easy fix and there's no easy answer [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2937.2000000000003s)]
*  It's just going to be [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2942.4s)]
*  a grind [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2944.0s)]
*  You know and in 2016 people were constantly saying like this is not normal, you know, we're not like this. This is not who we are. Well [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2945.36s)]
*  It is who we are for another four years at least [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2951.76s)]
*  A whole lot of people normalized them a whole lot of people normalized them and we're in a deep hole [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2954.7200000000003s)]
*  And we're gonna have to fucking battle our way out of it. Uh, and it's gonna be awful [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2958.88s)]
*  Um, but the country has done this before, you know [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2962.64s)]
*  If you think about the 60s like jfk was assassinated martin luther king was assassinated robert f kendy was assassinated like [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2965.04s)]
*  Country went to a real dark place vietnam was raging like things have been really bad [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2971.68s)]
*  And we've come through it and so we just got to have some hope and keep plugging [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2976.08s)]
*  Because um [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2980.4s)]
*  No other choice [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2982.32s)]
*  Yeah, I will say to everyone like we've all grieved and if you've if you've grieved a loved one [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2983.76s)]
*  You know that there's no wrong way to grieve [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2991.28s)]
*  You can be mad. You can be sad. You can be numb. You can be darkly funny at times [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2993.92s)]
*  And I do think as you are talking to other people in your life [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=2999.36s)]
*  We're dealing with this like giving everyone grace to sort of deal with this their own way [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=3002.48s)]
*  Um, I know for one like I don't want to spend a ton of time [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=3007.2799999999997s)]
*  Blaming allies people who are on our side and like yelling at them and fighting with them. We're gonna have a debate [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=3011.02s)]
*  We're gonna disagree. I think we can do so respectfully [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=3016.64s)]
*  But we're all on the same team here [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=3019.7599999999998s)]
*  And if we want to figure this out, then I think we've got to you know, we've got to be good to each other [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=3022.3199999999997s)]
*  Uh right now and in the and in the months to come because I think solidarity is important [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=3027.9199999999996s)]
*  um, I also want to be like very clear-eyed about [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=3033.2s)]
*  What voters want what they chose? [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=3036.7999999999997s)]
*  and realize that [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=3039.68s)]
*  Here in a democracy you have every right if you want to blame [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=3041.2799999999997s)]
*  Or scold your fellow citizens for their political choices [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=3046.0s)]
*  But that is just not the best way to persuade them to uh join your side and build a durable majority to actually win [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=3049.4399999999996s)]
*  so [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=3057.7599999999998s)]
*  part of this in the next couple of years and months is going to be [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=3058.7999999999997s)]
*  Talking with people and and empathizing with people who do not share your views and in fact have views that you might find [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=3062.88s)]
*  Terrible and it's not necessarily because you want to be nice [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=3070.56s)]
*  It's because you want to be smart and build a political majority and that's what politics is fundamentally [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=3074.0s)]
*  um also like [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=3079.28s)]
*  You know if you guys want to take some time off unplug not listen to us for a little bit. That's okay [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=3081.36s)]
*  Hey, hey, hey, hey [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=3086.88s)]
*  It's it's understood, you know, it's understandable [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=3088.96s)]
*  Uh, we need to listen. We need the listens. Yeah, but I I do hope that everyone gets back into the fight eventually because that [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=3092.0s)]
*  Is literally the only chance we have to build the society that we want is to get up every day and try to do better [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=3098.8s)]
*  and [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=3105.92s)]
*  You know love it. I think you you like the saying when we fight, okay, we don't always win. Well, right [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=3106.88s)]
*  Well, that's the problem, right? If we don't fight we definitely right it was the tragedy [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=3112.08s)]
*  It was the it was the it was the fallacy of the converse if we don't fight we lose right [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=3116.2400000000002s)]
*  We don't always win when we fight [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=3121.6800000000003s)]
*  And that's and that's an important lesson [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=3124.32s)]
*  Today, I what do you guys think happened to the 13 keys? [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=3126.88s)]

*  Seeing that joy and that is not invalid because we lost if there's anything that I find [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=3157.44s)]
*  Noxious and awful about what trump represents. It is the way he wants everyone to dislike everything and everyone except him [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=3164.54s)]
*  He turns his supporters not just against us not just against americans turns them against disney football baseball [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVlBoC1TbZ4&t=3172.56s)]
