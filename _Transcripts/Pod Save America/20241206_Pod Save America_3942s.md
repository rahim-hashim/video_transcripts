Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Biden Considers Preemptive Pardons for Likely Trump Targets
**Pod Save America:** [December 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU)
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Jon Favreau. I'm Jan Pfeiffer. On today's show, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=0.0s)]
*  House Democrats make moves to overthrow the gerontocracy. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  We're getting more information about who the swing voters were in the 2024 election, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=9.92s)]
*  the kind of information they're getting and how Trump won them over. Then we get to hear [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=15.36s)]
*  Dan's conversation with our friend Steve Shale, a Democratic strategist and campaign vet in Florida [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=21.12s)]
*  about how we got into such a deep hole there, especially with Latino voters, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=26.16s)]
*  and why he's worried that what happened to Democrats in Florida may not stay there. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=30.16s)]
*  But first, you heard it on Pod Save America first. On Tuesday's show, Tommy and I both mentioned [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=35.36s)]
*  that it might be a good idea for Biden to issue preemptive pardons for people who Trump and his [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=42.0s)]
*  allies have said they want to prosecute, which according to Politico's Jonathan Martin, the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=46.16s)]
*  White House is now considering. You're welcome, Adam Schiff and Liz Cheney. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=52.0s)]
*  Just kidding. We were not even close to the first that raised that. The White House has been [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=58.72s)]
*  working on it in a while, apparently, according to J. Mart. He says that there has been a, quote, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=64.72s)]
*  vigorous internal debate about this among a small group of the most senior White House aides, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=70.0s)]
*  including the White House counsel and the chief of staff, though the president himself has not [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=75.68s)]
*  yet been part of the discussions. The news has set off a debate among Democrats over whether it's [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=80.8s)]
*  wise to issue preemptive blanket pardons. Congressman Brendan Boyle, who's a close ally [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=86.88s)]
*  of Biden's, said that Trump's decision to put Cash Patel in charge of the FBI means that prosecuting [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=94.24s)]
*  his enemies is, quote, no hypothetical threat and urged the president to give the pardons. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=99.12s)]
*  But Schiff himself, who would presumably be on the list, urged Biden not to do it, arguing that [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=104.32s)]
*  it would seem defensive and unnecessary. Jim Jordan was actually asked about this, the idea [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=109.44s)]
*  of a preemptive pardon. We're going to listen to what he said, then we're going to listen to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=114.16s)]
*  what Donald Trump says about what he plans to do. Democrats are now asking Joe Biden for a preemptive [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=118.24s)]
*  pardon, OK, of Liz Cheney, Adam Schiff and Tony Fauci. What is this all about? Preemptive pardons [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  for heaven's sake. This is ridiculous. Donald Trump has never been about retribution. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=136.4s)]
*  Already hundreds of people have been murdered because of her action at the border, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=141.12s)]
*  and thousands more will follow in rapid succession. She should be impeached and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=145.52s)]
*  prosecuted for her actions. Nancy Pelosi should be prosecuted for that. If we win and when we win, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=150.72s)]
*  we're going to prosecute people that cheat on this election. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  And if we can, we'll go back to the last one, too, if we're allowed. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=160.96s)]
*  What do you think? You think they're going to be allowed? All right. What do you think of this [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=169.44s)]
*  pros and cons of blanket preemptive pardons from President Biden on his way out the door? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=173.68s)]
*  Let me start with the one con, which I give zero fucks about, which is the idea that somehow doing [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=179.36s)]
*  this breaks a norm or makes it easier for Trump to do what he wants to do when he leaves office. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=186.48s)]
*  Trump's going to do what Trump wants to do no matter what, whether Biden does preemptive [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  pardons or not. Trump will if he wants to do the same thing, he'll do the same thing for his people. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=194.88s)]
*  We should stop reverse engineering our ideas around our actions around things Trump may or [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=198.32s)]
*  may not do. That is stupid. The pros here are pretty clear. Donald Trump campaigned on prosecuting [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  his political opponents. He picked someone to head the FBI who published a literal enemies list. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=210.56s)]
*  People to prosecute. There's no subtlety happening here. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  What an appendix, you know? In the back of the book. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=220.88s)]
*  He was hoping people wouldn't find it, but we did. The idea of preemptive pardons is a rational [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=225.6s)]
*  response to what Trump is promising to do with his words and his actions. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=234.72s)]
*  And if you run around saying and believing, as Joe Biden has done and said, and I think we have said [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=241.12s)]
*  and believe that Donald Trump is an existential threat to democracy, this sort of action of [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=248.24s)]
*  preemptive pardon is a rational response to that threat. The con here is also pretty serious, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=253.04s)]
*  which is people don't trust government. They think everyone's corrupt. And these people did [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=261.68s)]
*  nothing wrong. These are invented crimes. Trump can't even define the crimes they committed. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=266.64s)]
*  And if you offer them pardons, it's going to give people a reason to believe that crimes [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=272.64s)]
*  were really committed, that the Biden administration really was corrupt, that these people really did [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=277.28s)]
*  do something wrong. Because why would you do that? It's hard to explain to the median voter that [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=280.64s)]
*  we need these pardons because of someone named Kash Patel. That doesn't make sense. And you're [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  just going to assume your natural inclination is people are corrupt. So that's the downside to it, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=290.88s)]
*  I think. It's funny. I didn't think about that downside. I guess if I was going to announce it [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=294.8s)]
*  and I was Joe Biden, I would play maybe even a longer supercut like the one we just did [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  of all the times and all the people Trump said he was going to prosecute and then put Kash Patel [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=307.04s)]
*  in there too, saying that he's going to come after people and whoever else is in his administration [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=311.92s)]
*  and be like, that's why I'm doing this. These people did not commit any crimes. They're innocent. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=315.36s)]
*  I don't know. You're right. The way that people would consume the news about it could lead them [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=320.72s)]
*  to believe that these folks are actually guilty. I think the other con is, or at least one of the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=327.92s)]
*  challenges with doing this is, where do you draw the line? Where do you stop? Who's on the list? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=333.04s)]
*  I know. That's pretty clear. You start with Anthony Fauci and you end somewhere right after [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=340.8s)]
*  our podcasters. That's the plan. Apparently, the Washington Post followed up on the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=346.32s)]
*  Jaymarts reporting today. They said that people who have been discussed are General Milley, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=353.2s)]
*  Fauci, Schiff, Cheney, Jim Clyburn, I think gave an interview to CNN. He said that Jack Smith's on [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=360.24s)]
*  his list, but you can start to see where this grows. All right, so is Jack Smith's on the list? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=366.8s)]
*  What about Jack Smith's whole team? What about most of the Justice Department? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=371.12s)]
*  I mean, the danger is that Biden saves a bunch of people and then, and Lovett brought this up on [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=375.04s)]
*  Tuesday, then the next group of mid-level people have targets on their backs. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=381.04s)]
*  Yeah, there are 1 million challenges to this approach. I think if you're going to do it, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=387.68s)]
*  you should at least limit it to people who worked in the administration, who did things that Joe [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=394.32000000000005s)]
*  Biden asked them to do as part of their jobs. Once you start getting members of Congress, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=399.92s)]
*  I think that's ridiculous. Is it going to be Schiff, Cheney? What about Eric Swalwell? They [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=406.88s)]
*  seem to hate Eric Swalwell and keep accusing him of espionage. What about Joe and Mika? What about [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=412.08000000000004s)]
*  Leslie Stahl? What about the producer? It just goes down the road. I think Joe and Mika secured [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=415.76s)]
*  their freedom. Well, I mean, they're waiting with bated breath to find out, I'm sure. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=420.16s)]
*  And so, you could go down the line forever if you were to do this, Fauci, Milley, Jack Smith, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=426.24s)]
*  but it's hard. There is no good answer here. We are in unprecedented and dangerous territory. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=434.08s)]
*  I do think it's good that they are contemplating it and thinking about it because I think there [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=439.92s)]
*  has been this sense, and I felt this since the election, that it's like, oh, Donald Trump's [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=443.76s)]
*  is huge danger. Oh my God, everything's terrible. And then it's like, it's not really not that bad, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=447.6s)]
*  as bad as you think it is. And it is an important corollary to the conversation on the Hunter Biden [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=450.72s)]
*  pardon, right? Where it's not just that, right? That one went first, that one went first because [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=457.68s)]
*  of the sentencing, but at least you're thinking of other ways to do it. And if he does do it, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=463.04s)]
*  this is my main criticism of the Hunter Biden pardon. I understand why. I was kind of mad [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=468.88000000000005s)]
*  about it at first. I understand why Biden did it. I probably would have done the exact same thing. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=476.08000000000004s)]
*  In fact, I'm 100% sure I would do the exact same thing. But if he were to do it, he's got to go [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=479.36s)]
*  out and explain it. You can't do a paper statement on Sunday night. You have to just go out and defend [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=486.48s)]
*  it. And just like the way you said it, we don't want to do this. This wasn't our choice, but [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=491.12s)]
*  he picked a guy to head the FBI who published an enemies list. So maybe I should protect people [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=497.2s)]
*  on the list, right? Like maybe just use that list. Yeah. I mean, look, we talked about this Tuesday [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=501.68s)]
*  and if I was in his shoes, I probably would have done the same thing too. I do think that [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=506.72s)]
*  if you imagine what you just suggested, which is like, imagine if Biden comes out and includes [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=513.6800000000001s)]
*  the Hunter pardon with this blanket preemptive pardon for all the people who have been part of [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=520.4s)]
*  the administration or worked closely with Joe Biden that Trump has specifically mentioned [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=527.6800000000001s)]
*  that he wants to prosecute. And same thing with Cash Patel and same thing with anyone else in his [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=532.48s)]
*  orbit who's explicitly listed people that they want to prosecute. And you did it all at once. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=537.2800000000001s)]
*  You probably don't get the blowback or at least you don't get as much blowback as he did by just. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=542.6400000000001s)]
*  And I still think if he decides not to do these at all and only pardons Hunter, and then we're in [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=548.5600000000001s)]
*  2025 and Trump's president, suddenly there's a whole bunch of prosecutions. That's a con for not [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=555.2800000000001s)]
*  doing it. But I was in favor of this when I first heard about it. It's not like cut and dry and [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=561.76s)]
*  easy. Also, by the way, the other thing is that the pardons don't protect you from a crazy red [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=570.3199999999999s)]
*  state prosecutor, attorney general, someone in a red state, like state level crimes you're not [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=577.12s)]
*  protected from. And then the other challenge here is the Hunter pardon was this very sweeping [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=583.44s)]
*  blanket pardon. Any crimes that may have been committed over a 10 year period. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=591.36s)]
*  The only other time there was a pardon that sweeping in modern history was the pardon that [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=596.5600000000001s)]
*  Ford gave Nixon. It was preemptive and it was pretty complete. These kinds of pardons have not [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=603.2800000000001s)]
*  been tested at the Supreme Court yet. Like pardons for crimes that have not been committed that are [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=609.36s)]
*  not specified in the pardon. So there is like a risk there, but it's fucking crazy by the way [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=615.36s)]
*  that we're just, we should have said at the outset, it's crazy that we're talking about this. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=620.5600000000001s)]
*  It is like. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=624.4s)]
*  And that it's not insane that Biden's thinking about it, right? That's the thing. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=625.28s)]
*  Fucking nuts. It also is like the pardon. The pardon power is, wow, really stupid, bad, bad [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=628.96s)]
*  from the founders because I mean, not their only one, John, but like your point at the beginning [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=636.4s)]
*  where it's like, Oh yeah, Trump's going to do it. Trump's going to do that is true. But like, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=643.68s)]
*  I mean, Trump could just basically come into office and say, everyone should go commit crimes, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=648.64s)]
*  go kill people, go do whatever and I'll pardon you afterwards. No big deal. And now the Supreme [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=655.92s)]
*  Court has said he can't be prosecuted for that. He wouldn't be impeached for that because, you [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=662.4s)]
*  know, Republicans do whatever he says. And so that's it. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=668.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. We have been, what the Supreme Court's immunity decision and all of this conversation [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=671.84s)]
*  on pardons just sort of codified something that became obviously true during the Trump [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=677.76s)]
*  administration, which is a president can commit, at least a Republican president can commit any [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=682.64s)]
*  crimes they want. They can't be charged while in office. They cannot be impeached because of [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=687.6s)]
*  the radicalization of the Republican party and polarization. And now because the Supreme Court, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=693.9200000000001s)]
*  they can commit crimes out of office. Yeah. What did you make a shift comments about? I mean, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=698.4s)]
*  now I would say that I think if you want a preemptive pardon, you probably wouldn't [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=704.0s)]
*  publicly say that you want to preemptive pardon first, first rule of preemptive pardon club. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=709.6s)]
*  Guess we broke that. But do you think do you think he just cares about the norms because [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=717.6s)]
*  he's a norms guy? He is a norms guy. I also I think it's the norms and trust that this [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=722.16s)]
*  obviously he's very, very smart. This is incredibly complicated. This is sort of things that [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=729.36s)]
*  White House advisors and lawyers and legal scholars can sit around discuss for 17 straight days and [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=733.6800000000001s)]
*  come to no conclusion, end up not doing it because it's so complicated because there is no obvious [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=739.2s)]
*  way to do it. I do think I imagine the ship is also concerned about what it says to the public [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=743.92s)]
*  about the party. Yeah. People are going to think you're guilty of crimes. Yeah. It's just it [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=750.4s)]
*  reinforces their view that everyone's corrupt. Yeah. Like if Trump going out of office, if Trump [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=755.84s)]
*  had just unilaterally pardoned all of his people for anything that may have happened, imagine what [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=762.48s)]
*  we would have thought about that. Imagine what the average voter would have thought about that. I mean, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=766.64s)]
*  he tried to overturn the election and cited a violent insurrection and then everyone was like, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=769.92s)]
*  yeah, let's take another flyer on the guy. Well, you got to point his Democrats off a few years [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=773.4399999999999s)]
*  to fix the problem. But I don't know, man. I don't know. Like I actually I don't I really the one [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=778.0s)]
*  thing I doubt and I am I think I'm in favor of this idea. But the one thing I doubt is that [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=785.1999999999999s)]
*  the public would be like, oh, they're all guilty. I think the public be like, well, he's got the [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=791.36s)]
*  power. He can do what he wants. It feels like one thing I have learned from this last election [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=794.48s)]
*  is that most people in this country do not give a fucking shit about norms. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=799.28s)]
*  And I don't think it's the norms. I agree. I've I wrote an entire book about breaking norms. I am [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=803.76s)]
*  very anti norm. I've been anti norms for a long time. Norma is not norm. I like. Yeah, that's [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=808.9599999999999s)]
*  you. Yes. Yes. Norma is the only norm I like, I guess. Anyway, but I the way in which we are [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=813.68s)]
*  going to get back to power is to be able to convince the median voter that the other side [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=822.16s)]
*  is corrupt. Yeah, I get that. And that gets harder to do in this situation. Yeah, but it's [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=826.24s)]
*  not like there's allegations against those people that are real. It's not like I mean, Hunter, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=831.2s)]
*  right? Like the Hunter stuff. You're like, oh, yeah, he I mean, a jury convicted him of crimes. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=836.48s)]
*  Well, I mean, jury convicted Donald Trump of crimes, too. Right. But like the [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=841.92s)]
*  right feels about the Trump crime. Yes. The problem we have here is that it's all fake. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=845.44s)]
*  It's all fake. And like, of course, the MAGA people would be like, yeah, there he gave them [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=850.0s)]
*  pardons because they're all really corrupt. But most people would be like, oh, yeah, Donald Trump [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=856.08s)]
*  ran around saying he was going to prosecute people. So I guess Biden used his like special, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=859.76s)]
*  you know, his special power to to help them. I guess that's what you get to do when you're [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=864.16s)]
*  president because they're all fucking corrupt. I guess we'll test this proposition maybe one day. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=867.76s)]
*  Really bad, really bad. All right. Let's talk about what's going on with House Democrats, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=873.76s)]
*  who are going to end up with 215 members now that Adam Gray officially pulled off a [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=878.0s)]
*  win here in California by less than 200 votes, 200 votes. What do we say? Every vote matters. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=884.16s)]
*  This is why you go out. This is why you knock on doors, make phone calls, because Adam Gray won by [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=890.0s)]
*  200 votes and Democrats have 215. There will be 220 Republicans. But with Matt Gates not returning [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=893.84s)]
*  and Elise Stefanik and Mike Waltzleaf, leaving for jobs in the administration, that is a [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=902.0s)]
*  217 to 215 margin for the opening stretch, meaning that if all Democrats vote together [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=907.6800000000001s)]
*  and just one Republican joins them, you'd get a tie, which in the House means the vote fails. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=914.32s)]
*  Even so, being in the majority means Republicans will get to chair every committee, hire staff, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=920.32s)]
*  send out subpoenas, control just about everything. The most powerful Democrat on each committee will [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=925.44s)]
*  then be known as the ranking member. And since they're in the minority, their main job is basically [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=930.96s)]
*  representing the opposition party during hearings and generally making Republicans' lives difficult, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=936.24s)]
*  which is why Democrats have decided that their best shot here is to bounce some of their older [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=943.6s)]
*  ranking members on key committees in favor of younger, more telegenic folks. On the Judiciary [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=948.6400000000001s)]
*  Committee, Maryland Congressman Jamie Raskin announced a challenge to New York Congressman [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=955.2s)]
*  Jerry Nadler, apparently at the urging of Gen Z sensation Nancy Pelosi. Nadler couldn't show up [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=959.52s)]
*  the votes and announced that he is bowing out. So Jamie Raskin will be the ranking member on [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=966.96s)]
*  Judiciary. On the Oversight Committee, where all the fun investigations take place, AOC has said [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=973.04s)]
*  that she's interested in taking Raskin's spot as the ranking member, since he's going to Judiciary, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=980.16s)]
*  but she hasn't made a final decision. And then similar scenes are playing out on the Agriculture [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=985.52s)]
*  and Natural Resources Committees. I know those are two committees that you're very excited about. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=992.0799999999999s)]
*  We don't talk a lot about congressional committees here, since Dan just fell asleep while I was [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=998.16s)]
*  talking, but this seemed worth getting into. Do you think this is, what do you think about this [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1002.56s)]
*  overall move towards sort of younger, more telegenic Democrats on these committees? Why is that [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1007.6s)]
*  valuable? What does it matter? What do you think? I don't want to overstate the importance of the [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1014.96s)]
*  ranking members on committees. There are some exceptions. I don't know if there's that much [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1020.24s)]
*  of a danger, but go ahead. Yes. But what I appreciate is that this is a recognition of the [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1026.56s)]
*  fact that Democrats have lost touch with younger voters. That has been a trend that has been [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1033.52s)]
*  ongoing for eight years here. We had an 80-year-old president. We had congressional [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1041.84s)]
*  leadership in their 70s. We had two consecutive nominees in Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden who were, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1046.48s)]
*  at best, young voters had lukewarm feelings about, did not feel like that they represented them. That [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1055.12s)]
*  was something that came up in all of it. Kamala Harris did much, even though she did not end up [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1058.8s)]
*  doing as well as we would like with younger voters, she at least was more culturally connected with [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1063.44s)]
*  at least parts of our base than Democrats, but we have a real problem here. Trying to put younger [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1068.8s)]
*  faces forward is absolutely essential. The House leadership, to their credit, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1076.1599999999999s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi, Steny Hoyer, Jim Clyburn, they stepped aside. They made room for Hakeem Jefferies and [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1081.04s)]
*  his team who are younger. They are more modern media savvy and that's good. Doing that here is [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1085.28s)]
*  a good thing. It does, I will say, speak to the challenges of the gerontocracy that we are pivoting [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1091.2s)]
*  from Jerry Nadler in his 70s to Jamie Raskin who is 61, I think. We are not exactly getting a bunch [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1097.76s)]
*  of likes. We are not getting like Maxwell Frost there yet, but it is progress. It is progress. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1105.2s)]
*  I mentioned gerontocracy at the beginning and it is sort of a joke. I think it is less about age [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1111.36s)]
*  and more about performance and being good on TV. Committee hearings, let's be honest, are about [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1117.52s)]
*  performance these days. I know a lot of staff work goes into committee hearings. They are important [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1124.72s)]
*  for legislation, but especially when you get to what the Republicans have done to the Oversight [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1131.3600000000001s)]
*  Committee where it is just like a place to have these investigations and it is a circus and they [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1136.0s)]
*  do all these hearings. What you need is people who are good on TV and who are good performers [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1140.48s)]
*  and who get it and who are going to have moments that end up going viral. I think we saw that even [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1145.84s)]
*  in the difference between some of the hearings we have seen. The January 6 hearings, for example, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1153.68s)]
*  I think probably went better than most people expected partly because Liz Cheney was excellent [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1159.8400000000001s)]
*  during them. They also did not let every single person on the panel speak and give five-minute [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1165.8400000000001s)]
*  speeches. Forget about the members being old. The entire style of communication in Congress is old. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1172.24s)]
*  The rules, the way people do it, the chart, all of it. I think when you have people who are new [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1182.0s)]
*  to Congress who tend to be younger or people who are just practiced being on TV speaking to voters, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1189.12s)]
*  speaking to reporters, it is going to be more compelling. Especially if you are in the minority [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1195.52s)]
*  and you do not have that much power to begin with, all you really have is the performance that you [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1201.44s)]
*  deliver at these hearings. You might as well go with your best. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1206.56s)]
*  Yeah, that is exactly right. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1211.1200000000001s)]
*  What do you think about AOC? AOC's move for oversight? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1213.3600000000001s)]
*  I love this idea. Let us just be frank. AOC is probably the best communicator in the Democratic [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1218.64s)]
*  Party right now. What she says, how she says it and where she says it. She is obviously very [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1224.96s)]
*  good at getting attention. She is quite relatable. I was on TikTok and I saw this [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1231.1200000000001s)]
*  video of AOC making an espresso martini. It was like, get yourself a member of Congress who can [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1237.2s)]
*  make a homemade espresso martini. The thing that is interesting is I am pretty sure I did not even [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1242.8s)]
*  see it on her page. I saw it on an AOC fan page. How many members of Congress have a fan page on [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1246.48s)]
*  TikTok? Their content is so compelling that other people are trying to draft off of it for engagement [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1252.48s)]
*  by reposting their videos. Do you know that I can make an espresso martini as well? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1259.28s)]
*  How often do you make them? Once in a while. They are pretty good. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1264.16s)]
*  Is it good? Is yours pretty good? Ask Emily. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1269.1200000000001s)]
*  I hate to really age myself here, but I do not think I can have caffeine that late at night. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1273.52s)]
*  No, I am sure you can. I really tap out at about 10 am. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1277.68s)]
*  I need a steady drip of caffeine from 5 am right through bedtime. It is weird that, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1284.3200000000002s)]
*  I recognize I am up at the same time you are, but it is weird you are such a, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1293.44s)]
*  not a great sleeper. It is just polishing that Diet Coke off with dessert. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1297.1200000000001s)]
*  Anyway, I want to check out AOC's recipe, but go on. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1301.28s)]
*  Yes. Anyway, I think she is a phenomenal communicator and there is a benefit in the fact [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1304.56s)]
*  that she drives the Republicans insane. That is good because it just means more attention. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1311.28s)]
*  If we had picked AOC being the ranking member on these hearings, it means they are going to get [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1319.44s)]
*  more attention, more coverage, certainly more, what is going to matter even more than whether CNN [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1324.32s)]
*  takes it live is whether people are going to clip parts of it and put it on social media and that [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1328.96s)]
*  will happen with her. I think she is very smart and she has been very good in these hearings [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1333.2s)]
*  and she speaks like a human. I think this is great. I hope she does it. I hope people [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1337.04s)]
*  support her doing it. I will also say that she does drive [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1342.64s)]
*  Republicans crazy, but when she speaks during these hearings, it is not the typical, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1346.16s)]
*  she does not just make the whole thing about the Republicans on the committee or about Republicans [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1354.0800000000002s)]
*  in general. I do think that is important because I think there are a lot of members and moments [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1358.64s)]
*  that go viral that libs share. We all share with each other and we all think it is amazing, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1364.48s)]
*  and I think if most voters saw it, they would be like, people are yelling at each other, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1372.0s)]
*  the Republicans are an asshole, the Democrats are an asshole, they are all going back and forth, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1375.92s)]
*  they do not care who started it. I think that AOC, I think on the oversight committee, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1379.04s)]
*  if she ends up being ranking member, and then part of this is a play where if we take back the house [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1385.84s)]
*  in 2026, then she has subpoena power and then she can hold her own hearings on oversight. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1390.0s)]
*  I would imagine that she would be more like a Katie Porter model than just beat up Republicans. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1396.56s)]
*  Imagining AOC bringing in a bunch of CEOs and corporate interests and lobbyists and [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1403.6s)]
*  just sort of holding them accountable at these hearings for why they are screwing [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1409.6s)]
*  most working class Americans, I think that is even more effective than like, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1414.4s)]
*  oh, did you see this AOC dunk on Jim Jordan? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1418.96s)]
*  Yeah, the dunk thing is very important because we, you and I saw this at the convention, we saw so [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1422.0s)]
*  many of the speeches that especially the Democratic House members were doing were basically reverse [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1427.92s)]
*  engineered from a dunk on Republicans moment that could go viral. AOC does not have to do something [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1433.52s)]
*  to go viral. There is a certain set of politicians who have this ability for whatever reason. Trump [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1442.0800000000002s)]
*  is one of them. Obama was one of them. You can just, Pete is very good, same thing where you [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1448.08s)]
*  don't have to just, your presence doing what you do authentically gets attention and traffics on [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1453.12s)]
*  the internet as opposed to trying to come up with a thing where you're just going to like really [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1458.8799999999999s)]
*  take down Marjorie Taylor Greene or in front of everyone is a way to do it. And it just, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1463.6799999999998s)]
*  it makes it easier to have a conversation in that committee that speaks to voters as [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1468.56s)]
*  opposed to speaks to political junkies who will hit the share button. AOC destroys Marjorie Taylor [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1474.4s)]
*  Greene. I mean, right now, Elijah's thinking that's great SEO. I want that. That's right. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1481.3600000000001s)]
*  No one wants this more than Elijah because it is, we're going to crush on YouTube if that happens. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1487.2s)]
*  All right. Before we get to your conversation with Steve Schaile about how Democrats can win again, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1492.24s)]
*  want to talk about some new findings that the party might be able to draw some lessons from? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1496.24s)]
*  I'm sure you've heard of the Trump campaign. It's a pretty good one. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1500.64s)]
*  Shane Goldmacher at the New York Times dropped a long story on Thursday in which the Trump [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1501.92s)]
*  campaign explained how they went after swing voters on streaming services. So according to [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1506.24s)]
*  campaign officials, they put together an actual list of 6.3 million individual battleground state [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1512.64s)]
*  voters that they thought were persuadable. That was about 14% of battleground state voters. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1519.76s)]
*  They tended to be young, non-white, and they heavily use streaming services like [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1526.0s)]
*  Tubi and Roku. I've never even heard of Tubi before this piece. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1530.8799999999999s)]
*  Oh, come on, Sean. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1534.32s)]
*  In fact, the Trump campaign believed that about half of this group of persuadable voters watched [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1535.52s)]
*  streaming TV exclusively. The Trump campaign referred to these voters as, quote, streaming [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1540.8s)]
*  persuadables. And I had no idea, but apparently a lot of these streaming channels now allow you [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1546.72s)]
*  to target ads to individual households rather than just regions. The Trump campaign said they [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1552.4s)]
*  took advantage of that feature, but the Harris campaign didn't, which meant that they were [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1559.68s)]
*  spending huge amounts of money on viewers who had already made up their minds while the Trump folks [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1562.8000000000002s)]
*  were able to make their money go further. This is, of course, according to the Trump campaign. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1566.88s)]
*  This general theory of swing voters' media consumption is backed up by new data from [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1572.5600000000002s)]
*  Navigator. This is based on their big survey of 5,000 people who said they voted in the election. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1576.72s)]
*  Whereas half of Harris voters said they get their news from broadcast television, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1582.5600000000002s)]
*  only 38% of swing voters said they did. They were much more likely to get their news from YouTube [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1586.0s)]
*  and Facebook. 61% of swing voters said they watch live TV through a streaming service, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1590.88s)]
*  and only 42% of them said they get their live TV through cable or satellite. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1596.72s)]
*  All right, there's a lot in there. What did you think of the Times piece? And do you buy [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1602.4s)]
*  the Trump campaign's take on how much this targeting mattered and what was happening [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1605.6000000000001s)]
*  with the Harris campaign? I think we should stipulate that the Trump campaign did a very [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1611.76s)]
*  good job of communicating with their target voters through a variety of means. Paid advertising, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1616.48s)]
*  including this target individualized targeting on streaming, all of his media appearances, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1621.6s)]
*  the work they did with influencers like Aidan Ross and the Milk Boys. They knew who their target [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1629.12s)]
*  voters were and they went after them and they clearly reached them. I do feel a little bit like [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1632.96s)]
*  in reading this story that they're taking what is a relatively common tactic for political [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1639.44s)]
*  advertising and treating it as sorcery. So I think it was good that they had a challenge. Democrats [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1646.56s)]
*  had more money than Republicans. They had to spend their money more efficiently. This was an [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1651.76s)]
*  efficient way to do it. It's not as brilliant, I think, as maybe they would like us to believe, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1656.24s)]
*  but it obviously worked. So what am I to say? What do you make of the Harris campaign side of this? [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1661.6000000000001s)]
*  Why were they not targeting individual households on streaming and instead doing it by region [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1667.52s)]
*  and geography? They're doing it by zip code. Obviously, that's a smaller population of people [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1675.6s)]
*  than the metro area of Philadelphia or the state of Pennsylvania. And the reason why I believe [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1683.6s)]
*  the Harris campaign did what they did is pretty simple. In the battleground states, the Trump [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1690.56s)]
*  path to their win number was pretty simple. It was base vote plus some slice of this [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1697.04s)]
*  swing voter university that was overwhelmingly male and younger. That gets you there. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1706.56s)]
*  The Harris campaign path to these swing states, which are bipartisanship and political performance, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1711.04s)]
*  a couple of points to the right of the nation as a whole, was to get their base of core [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1717.76s)]
*  democratic voters. But then they also had to get some of these same young men voters. They had to [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1721.92s)]
*  get older black voters. They had to juice up their numbers with college-educated suburbanites. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1726.32s)]
*  They needed Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. They needed some of these Nikki [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1731.76s)]
*  Haley voters. They needed to juice the numbers with seniors. Their math was so much more [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1735.76s)]
*  complicated that it was more cost-efficient to do it by zip code than it was to do it on an [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1739.84s)]
*  individualized basis. And the other thing I just say about the individualized targeting is [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1746.8799999999999s)]
*  most streaming services, many of the streaming services do not allow political ads. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1750.64s)]
*  Like YouTube is the big one that does not. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1756.08s)]
*  Well, YouTube TV uses it. You can do political ads on YouTube TV. You can't do individualized on it. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1757.6s)]
*  You can't do individualized. Netflix, no political ads. And the vast majority of Netflix subscribers [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1764.08s)]
*  don't use the ad tier. But we brought up 2B and all of these fast networks. It's free ad-supported [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1769.28s)]
*  TV. It's like if you buy a smart TV today and you just turn it on connected to your internet, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1775.28s)]
*  you'll see a bunch of icons. 2B is one of them. There's a bunch of free TV that you can just watch [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1779.84s)]
*  with ads. And an increasing number of people do it, and particularly young people who get their [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1783.28s)]
*  diet is like Netflix, maybe another streaming service. And then if they're just flipping the [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1790.6399999999999s)]
*  channel or looking for something, they'll just go on to these fast channels and you reach those [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1795.04s)]
*  people. And so it's not that the Trump campaign is smarter than the Harris campaign. The Harris [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1800.72s)]
*  campaign was very smart about how they did a lot of their advertising. It's just they had to reach [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1804.6399999999999s)]
*  their... They had to reach a much more diverse group of voters to get to their win number. So [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1808.56s)]
*  it was probably much more efficient. Do you think about this way? You're doing zip code. Are you [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1816.72s)]
*  going to do a certain number of people in Waukesha, Wisconsin, or are you going to do [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1820.72s)]
*  a certain zip code in Waukesha, Wisconsin? And so it's kind of little six here, half dozen, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1826.8799999999999s)]
*  the other, I think. That makes a lot of sense. But it is the future. This is the future. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1831.44s)]
*  And this has consequences for Democrats because our advantage in a world where Republicans have [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1835.12s)]
*  a massive advantage on free media and social media was in paid linear television, particularly [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1840.4799999999998s)]
*  targeting people on cable, on people who are watching live television, news, sports, et cetera. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1849.12s)]
*  And that advantage is dramatically diminished and is going to be just... Given the rate at [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1855.04s)]
*  cord cutting and the rate at which the cable business is collapsing before us, it's hard to [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1860.48s)]
*  imagine what 2028 is going to look like, but it's going to be very different from this election. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1865.84s)]
*  06 Yeah, I just think that... I don't know. At some point, the utility of all of these ads and just [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1869.92s)]
*  one after another that sounds the same and looks the same and on your phone and you can't watch [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1880.8s)]
*  anything else, I feel like there's got to be diminishing marginal utility at some point. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1885.2s)]
*  I mean, it is the greatest waste of money in modern American history. Billions of dollars were [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1890.24s)]
*  spent to reach 12 million people in the country. Not even 12 million people. Just a few million [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1897.4399999999998s)]
*  people. 07 I could go on this forever, but I just... [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1904.56s)]
*  06 Well, I have a YouTube show about this. You're always welcome. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1907.6s)]
*  07 Well, it's just like there's... I feel like we're really... There's always a step that's [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1910.32s)]
*  being skipped, which is like, well, this ad tested really, really well. And it's like, yeah, of course, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1914.32s)]
*  you showed it to a bunch of voters and the voters are like, yeah, this is persuasive. This might [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1918.64s)]
*  make me vote more blah, blah, blah. And then you run the ad and then you know the ad reach people. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1921.76s)]
*  But we still don't know, but once the ad reaches the actual voter, does it move the voter [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1925.92s)]
*  to actually go get the... I mean, I know that you can... [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1934.72s)]
*  08 Yeah, you can do regression analysis on this stuff, but you never really know because it's [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1936.88s)]
*  impossible to test in a lab the actual impact of watching all the ads you see. I mean, we [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1941.76s)]
*  spent some time in battleground states at the end. If you watched... I watched football in [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1948.48s)]
*  Philadelphia way before our show started and... 08 Yeah, we left Philly and you voted for Trump. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1951.68s)]
*  08 That's right. And a lot of Harris ads actually. But then it's also how does it fit with all the... [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1956.48s)]
*  And what you really can't test is how the ad fits with all the other surround sound you're getting, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1962.24s)]
*  right? From social media, the regular news, stuff like that. So it's... A lot of money is being spent [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1967.92s)]
*  and we're not really sure why. 08 Cool, cool. One other perennial [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1972.08s)]
*  post-election debate is the question of turnout versus persuasion. The way this goes is, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1976.0s)]
*  did Kamala Harris lose because more Biden 2020 voters stayed home or because more Biden 2020 [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1981.84s)]
*  voters switched to Trump? The answer is always in every election, some of both. But one reason [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1988.24s)]
*  it's heavily debated is that if the loss was mostly caused by voters staying home, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=1997.36s)]
*  often there are lefty types who will argue that it's because the candidate didn't sufficiently [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2004.72s)]
*  excite the party's liberal base if the loss was mostly caused by voters switching parties. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2010.72s)]
*  Centrist types will argue that it's because the candidate failed to win the middle moderates. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2016.72s)]
*  Nate Cohn at the Times waded into the debate this week with a piece where he makes a few points. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2022.4s)]
*  One, lower turnout among Democrats was a big part of the story in non-battleground states this [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2026.64s)]
*  election, but not in the battleground states where turnout was much higher. And then a second [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2031.92s)]
*  point is the Times polling data suggests that the Biden 2020 voters who did stay home in 2024 [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2038.64s)]
*  weren't necessarily deciding between Kamala Harris and the couch, as is often the phrase. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2047.28s)]
*  They were, in fact, more moderate voters, less partisan, less ideological voters who, [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2053.2000000000003s)]
*  if they had turned out, could have just as easily supported Trump. What do you think? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2059.6s)]
*  Does this settle the argument once and for all? [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2066.24s)]
*  This argument will never be settled, John, for the exact reasons you laid out, which is people have [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2068.7999999999997s)]
*  an interest in defining it one way or the other when the answer is always both. The argument will [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2072.16s)]
*  never be solved because people have an interest in continuing the argument. It's happened in every [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2077.52s)]
*  losing election in my career. And it becomes, we're always looking for simple ways to tell [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2080.72s)]
*  ourselves a story, right? But this idea that there's this ocean of potential Democratic voters, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2086.4s)]
*  if we could just reach with our very compelling Democratic, very progressive message would turn [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2092.8s)]
*  out, that would be a great world to live in because your path to victory forever is obvious. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2098.56s)]
*  Another simple story to tell ourselves is if we could just sand down the edges on this issue or [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2106.2400000000002s)]
*  that issue, then we could get this mythical group of centrist, very focused policy voters who line [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2110.8s)]
*  up the white papers of both campaigns on a diner table somewhere in Wisconsin and they make a [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2119.1200000000003s)]
*  decision. No, voters are complicated and they have different reasons for turning out and different [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2126.0800000000004s)]
*  reasons for making their decisions. They are cross-pressured in thousands of ways. I do think in [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2131.52s)]
*  this election, the most brutally honest thing we can say to ourselves is that [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2136.4s)]
*  Donald Trump convinced our voters to leave us and join him. That is what happened. And we can't shy [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2143.28s)]
*  away from that because if you shy away from that- He did it in 2016. He added more votes in 2020, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2150.2400000000002s)]
*  even as he lost by 40,000 votes. I mean, Donald Trump added millions and millions and millions [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2159.04s)]
*  of votes to his total between 2016 and 2024. And a good portion of that is people who have voted for [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2165.84s)]
*  Democrats, Barack Obama, Joe Biden. That's what happened. Yeah. There's a bunch of Obama Trump [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2175.6800000000003s)]
*  voters. Got a bunch of Biden Trump voters. It is hard and dark, but I think you have to just reckon [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2183.1200000000003s)]
*  with the absolute wreckage that we're currently in so that you can right-size what the solutions [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2193.36s)]
*  are. Because if you want to tell yourself an overly simplistic story, and I think people in the center [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2198.6400000000003s)]
*  and the left are doing that, then you're not going to do all the work you have to do together. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2201.76s)]
*  Because we have to win. I know this was a very- I don't know if you heard this, John, but I did an [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2206.1600000000003s)]
*  interview with the Harris campaign. Whoa. Not a lot of people- happened over the holiday break. Not [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2210.7200000000003s)]
*  a lot of people noticed it. I got to check that out. Yeah. I think he would like it. I hope you were tough. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2214.6400000000003s)]
*  Well, I would say that Jada Mali-Dillon is still walking the earth, so I was not as tough as some [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2219.2s)]
*  people would like. In that interview, David Plath made the point that in these states, we have to [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2227.6s)]
*  crush it with moderate voters. And people got very mad about that. That's a mistake. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2238.08s)]
*  But the thing is, you have to- if we're going to win, we have to win moderate voters. We have to [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2244.72s)]
*  do better with independents. And we have to get all of those young voters who either went to Trump [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2251.44s)]
*  or stayed home. And some of the young voters definitely stayed home or were voters who should [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2257.2s)]
*  have been with us for a variety of reasons, including Gaza. And we have to get them all [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2261.28s)]
*  back here. We have to do all of those things. It's not as simple as one or the other. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2265.52s)]
*  And I think that's just the most important takeaway from this is that we have a very [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2269.28s)]
*  complicated task before us. It is the problem of having a big tent coalition. But it's that big [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2274.2400000000002s)]
*  tent coalition that has given us the ability to win the popular vote in all but two elections [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2279.2000000000003s)]
*  since 1988. And if we want to continue that, we have to figure out how to do all the things. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2283.84s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, the most simplified version of the argument that both sides are making, which is [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2288.2400000000002s)]
*  they are not actually making this argument, but this is just for the sake of talking about it, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2295.6s)]
*  is that- This is the Twitter version of it, I guess. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2300.08s)]
*  Yeah, right. Which is like, there's this economic populist button that if you press it, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2301.52s)]
*  suddenly just thousands and thousands and millions of voters who are just hanging out at home [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2307.68s)]
*  are just going to just leave their houses and run to the polls as fast as they can. Because now the [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2313.52s)]
*  Democrats actually stand for something, economic populism, that all these voters will come out and [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2317.92s)]
*  vote for them. And also if, in this instance, it had to do with Gaza as well in Michigan, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2323.76s)]
*  which did make a real difference in Michigan. And then on the other side, it's like, if only [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2330.8s)]
*  on cultural and social issues, if Democrats just sort of said, I'm not for trans rights, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2336.8s)]
*  I'm not going to talk about it anymore, I'm not going to talk about cultural issues anymore, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2345.76s)]
*  I'm not going to talk about immigration anymore, I'm going to be as tough as Republicans are on the [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2348.8s)]
*  border and I'm just going to take all these positions, then suddenly all the moderate [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2352.0s)]
*  voters, all the swing voters are going to come. And it's just, we talk about the data and everyone's [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2356.16s)]
*  like, the data, everyone's too into the data. It's like, don't call it data then, just go talk to [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2360.88s)]
*  fucking voters. It's math. I swear to God. It's just math. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2364.8s)]
*  Go out there, talk to fucking voters, people that you don't know, people that aren't like you, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2367.52s)]
*  sit down with them. And what I take from this, and this drives me, and it's because I've been [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2372.32s)]
*  doing this since- I've been having this conversation, this debate since when I did the first season of [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2377.36s)]
*  the wilderness in 2018, 2017, eight years ago now, seven years ago, whatever. And the way I [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2381.44s)]
*  think about it is the voter who, the Democratic voter or the person who has voted for Democrats [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2391.12s)]
*  in the past, who decides to stay home, is not that much different than the person who's voted [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2396.88s)]
*  for Democrats, who then switches to vote for Republicans. They're different, but they are not [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2405.6s)]
*  as different as this debate makes them out to be. They are less ideological, they are less partisan, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2410.72s)]
*  they tend to be, and what confuses Democrats is they tend to now be younger and non-white, [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2418.16s)]
*  which liberals think, oh, that's our voter. If they're young and they're a black voter or Latino [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2424.48s)]
*  voter, an age voter, then they must be progressive. And it's just the wrong way to think. It is not [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2430.48s)]
*  supported by the facts. And I think the same thing for some of these voters that switch to Trump, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2436.08s)]
*  right? And that doesn't mean that they're not- that doesn't mean that they're out of reach for us. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2443.36s)]
*  That doesn't mean that a good chunk of them would respond favorably to more progressive positions [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2448.88s)]
*  on X or a more economically populist position on Y or more cultural moderation on something else. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2455.68s)]
*  But you can't make blanket statements about entire identities of voters in terms of their [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2463.92s)]
*  behavior and how they're going to act in an election. You just can't do it anymore because [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2472.88s)]
*  people are just too different. I think one thing we should- there are several things I think we [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2478.2400000000002s)]
*  could do going forward that would help our mentality on this. One is we have to just [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2483.36s)]
*  eliminate the term GOTV as part of a messaging strategy. Everyone is a persuasion target. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2488.88s)]
*  They're all- I was just going to say that. They're all persuasion targets. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2494.16s)]
*  The second is we do have to just untrain ourselves from how we thought about politics for a long [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2497.44s)]
*  time. I think the term identity politics is obviously overused and has been weaponized by [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2502.48s)]
*  Republicans in really gross ways. But this idea that you used to be able to make real predictions [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2506.32s)]
*  about how people would vote based on their race, that is no longer true in politics. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2511.04s)]
*  So we should abolish the idea that we have any sense of how people are going to vote based on [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2515.04s)]
*  their race because that's clearly not true anymore. Finally, we probably ought to stop using the term [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2518.16s)]
*  moderate because moderate- and this isn't the way in which Plouffe used it in the interview- is [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2526.0s)]
*  that's how people self-identify. That's how they describe themselves to a pollster. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2530.88s)]
*  I think people miss that from that clip. That's why I'm surprised that clip got so much reaction [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2534.0s)]
*  because I'm like- the moderate thing you're saying, in an exit poll, it's how you self-ID. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2537.92s)]
*  The exit pollster says, are you liberal, moderate, or conservative? And then you pick one and you [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2543.2s)]
*  tell them. And that is different for every voter. That means some combination of maybe I am very [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2546.88s)]
*  liberal on economic issues. Certainly, Carolina, I'm a social security and Medicare, I'm protecting [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2554.64s)]
*  those and I might be a union member. But also maybe I'm concerned about the border. And then [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2559.2799999999997s)]
*  for other voters, it's the reverse, where it's like they are very liberal on social issues, like [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2564.4s)]
*  trans rights and marriage equality and all that, but they're deeply concerned about spending and [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2569.44s)]
*  taxes. And so we create these avatars of fake voters when everyone is different, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2574.8s)]
*  everyone has a different point of view. And so the other thing is stop thinking about voters [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2581.84s)]
*  ideologically because that puts them in the wrong bucket, I think, particularly when you get to the [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2587.0400000000004s)]

*  That is the way in which our politics moves now. Yeah. All right. When we come back from the break, [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2645.44s)]

*  of Florida politics, Steve Schale. Welcome to Pod Save America. Hey, thanks man. Good to see you. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2823.44s)]
*  Good to see you. All right. You spent your political career in Florida. You helped Obama win in 2008, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2827.52s)]
*  2012. You wrote a piece for the bulwark with the title, I watched the democratic collapse in [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2832.2400000000002s)]
*  Florida. I fear it's happening nationally, which certainly caught my attention. You were also on [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2837.76s)]
*  our list of people to talk to about what the hell happened in this election. So those are a great [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2842.0s)]
*  time to bring you on. I want to get into your recommendations for the party, what you think [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2844.96s)]
*  is happening nationally, but I want to start with the party collapse in Florida. We won in 08, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2849.36s)]
*  we won in 12, we barely lost in 16. And we lost, Democrats lost Florida in 2024 by a margin, [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2853.84s)]
*  not dissimilar to what we used to see in places like Montana. What the hell happened in your state? [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2861.28s)]
*  I think finally, the weight of the coalition falling apart. If you go back to say, for example, [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2866.48s)]
*  the Clinton years, we were winning Hispanics in Florida by 30 points. We began to see the slippage [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2872.96s)]
*  among Hispanic support here as early as 2018, certainly in 2020. A county, Dade County, that [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2882.56s)]
*  we won with Obama by 20 some odd points, Biden only won by seven. And you saw particularly those [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2889.44s)]
*  Hispanics that were non-Mexican, the exile era type, your Cubans, your Venezuelans, really just [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2895.36s)]
*  almost repelled to some of the rhetoric that was out there, defunding the police, [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2902.8s)]
*  some of the socialism talk. I mean, I remind folks all the time, if you're from Venezuela, [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2907.76s)]
*  you came here to avoid socialism. So when you hear people wax on politically about socialism, [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2912.4s)]
*  that brings back an immediate bad trigger. So we saw some of that kind of begin to slip away. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2917.92s)]
*  And then in 24, the combination of non-college whites, which again, we've seen kind of go the [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2923.44s)]
*  wrong way here added to the issues we've had with Hispanics. And it all just added up to a disaster, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2928.08s)]
*  frankly. I remember after 20 talking to folks in Florida and reading folks, I think you made this [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2933.2000000000003s)]
*  point that one of the things that happened between 16 and 20 was that a lot of the erratic [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2938.64s)]
*  democratic socialism really had an impact on people with Cuban and Venezuelan, maybe Salvadorian [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2947.7599999999998s)]
*  backgrounds in Florida. And that was a unique situation. But this time around, we saw in [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2954.56s)]
*  like Osceola County, a largely Puerto Rican county, just a massive collapse over the previous year. So [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2959.2s)]
*  it seems more widespread than that. Thoughts on that? Yeah. I mean, I think there's, you know, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2964.48s)]
*  listen, when you get this, you just, it doesn't your whole life. I mean, there's a permission [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2968.96s)]
*  structure in almost any community you go into. And so, you know, we used to talk about it, you know, [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2972.4s)]
*  back sort of college educated white voters who were Republicans in Florida, the Obama days, [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2977.12s)]
*  like our permission structure was talking about cutting taxes. And if we talked about cutting [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2981.2s)]
*  taxes, they would listen to us on other stuff. And a lot of the permission structure in the [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2984.96s)]
*  in these Hispanic communities, Puerto Ricans, for example, starts at sort of understanding that [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2989.3599999999997s)]
*  there's a cultural politics, which are a cultural sort of part of life that is different, that's [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=2994.96s)]
*  more conservative, you know, you know, that, you know, they may be with us on education, [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3001.12s)]
*  healthcare, but they may not be where we are on, for example, abortion. And, you know, I think that, [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3006.24s)]
*  you know, the sense in a lot of these communities is that we've gotten away from, but I'm not saying [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3011.3599999999997s)]
*  it's totally accurate. Just I think it's the sense of the reality that they see that we've [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3015.2799999999997s)]
*  gotten away from focusing on things like the Affordable Care Act on good schools, good jobs. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3019.12s)]
*  And we are now entirely focused on these social issues, which often kind of runs contrary to [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3024.8799999999997s)]
*  sort of the faith based sense of who they are as a people. And that's a real problem. And I think, [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3030.3199999999997s)]
*  you know, there was that interesting story that came out in the Atlantic, you may have seen, [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3035.28s)]
*  there was something like, you know, I think it was the voters thought that like the number two issue [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3038.32s)]
*  we cared about, around the country was trans issues, and number three issue was abortion. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3042.32s)]
*  And, you know, that, and again, I'm not saying we don't fight for those issues, no fight for [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3046.88s)]
*  marginalized voices. But when the perception is that is our primary goal, those communities where, [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3051.1200000000003s)]
*  you know, where faith is a big part of who they are, you know, it's hard for us to kind of get in [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3055.52s)]
*  the door to talk about other issues. You know, the Democrats have struggled, you know, we want, [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3059.6000000000004s)]
*  obviously, one Florida at the presidential level, you know, Bill Nelson had some success there for [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3063.28s)]
*  a while in recent years, but in general, Democrats have not had the governorship in Florida in more [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3067.2000000000003s)]
*  than a quarter century now. Is there any lessons you see there about sort of the organization and [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3071.6800000000003s)]
*  funding of the party infrastructure that can apply nationally sort of what you've seen over the course [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3076.4s)]
*  of your time there? Yeah, I mean, it's funny, I was talking to our mutual friend Sam Cronally [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3081.76s)]
*  at the DNC earlier. And I mean, the, you know, the places where state party infrastructure has [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3086.0s)]
*  really been bad, we've really struggled in. And, you know, Florida is a place where we just frankly [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3091.52s)]
*  haven't invested in the partisan infrastructure. And honestly, man, like, you know, I mean, as you [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3096.0s)]
*  know, I'm a homer for our old guy, but a lot of the stuff that we did coming out of the Obama years, [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3101.2s)]
*  and I think the Organizing for America infrastructure, a lot of which got kind of [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3106.56s)]
*  moved away from sort of partisan infrastructure into a lot of these C3 and C4 groups, in states [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3110.16s)]
*  that have weak political party infrastructure to begin with, really kind of set us on an awkward [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3115.92s)]
*  course. And, you know, the challenge we've had in Florida is that when we've had presidential [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3121.2s)]
*  elections that are engaged, we have this huge infrastructure, it's here for six months, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3125.2s)]
*  you know, registers, hundreds of thousands of voters, puts hundreds of kids on the ground, [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3129.04s)]
*  and then it leaves the next day, and there's nothing to take its place. And so as you know, [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3132.64s)]
*  as we got into 2020, for example, it had a very different kind of campaigning list, I don't blame [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3137.68s)]
*  the campaign for not putting people boots on the ground, we're dealing with COVID, we didn't know [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3141.3599999999997s)]
*  what we were dealing with. But I think not having that real infrastructure on the ground, even for [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3144.3199999999997s)]
*  presidential campaigns, and then having sort of nothing in between, you know, it just at all, [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3148.56s)]
*  an atrophy to really nothing. I mean, the Florida Democratic Party at this point literally operates [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3153.2s)]
*  out of a rented like third floor building and office downtown, and they maybe have three or [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3157.6s)]
*  four full time staffers in a state of 23 million people, it's hard to win from there. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3162.24s)]
*  Soterios Johnson 13 I mean, this is, I mean, Florida is obviously a state where there's a [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3165.84s)]
*  lot of money, right? A lot of the big Democratic donors come from Florida. Is it just, is it [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3168.64s)]
*  struggle? Is it people think it's a lost cause? Like, it's, you know, we've spent way more money [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3173.04s)]
*  in Texas over the last 10 years to try to turn that one blue, obviously, with less success as [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3177.2s)]
*  there as well. But like, I just sort of curious as to like what the struggle is to get actual [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3182.08s)]
*  investment. And I will say, I think it's important to note that we did almost win the governorship [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3187.4399999999996s)]
*  in 2018 in Florida, and we almost reelected Bill Nelson, we came within a basically a point, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3192.0s)]
*  I think, or close to a point in those. But just thousand votes do. Yeah, less than much less than [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3196.7999999999997s)]
*  that. For someone who's former political experience was Al Gore's election in the recount, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3203.6s)]
*  that seems like a landslide to me, but I get the point. But just what is preventing, you know, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3208.64s)]
*  broad scale infrastructure investment in state party infrastructure in Florida? And I take your [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3213.76s)]
*  point on Obama in 08 and 12. Like, I was part of some of those decisions, I understand why we made [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3219.2s)]
*  them. They had downstream effects that I think have been not awesome. And Florida's example of [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3224.4s)]
*  that. But you know, that we're 10 years past that now. I think, listen, a lot of southern states [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3229.04s)]
*  have this problem in that the political party infrastructure never existed in the same way that [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3234.64s)]
*  you a state like Michigan that has a strong union base has had a lot of governors like, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3238.48s)]
*  like a partisan infrastructure is part of their DNA. A lot of these southern states, the political [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3242.48s)]
*  party existed, frankly, just as a way for governors, old southern governors to run money through the [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3246.88s)]
*  get around contribution limits. And so we've never really had a real party to begin with. And then, [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3252.56s)]
*  you know, not having a governor who can help drive money to a political party is has been a [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3257.84s)]
*  tough issue. And so I think all of these things, you know, I tell donors all the time, listen, [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3262.7200000000003s)]
*  the Democratic Party is whatever the donors make it. You know, if you put eight or $10 million into [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3267.28s)]
*  it, it's going to be something better than it is today. But it's just, there's just never been a [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3272.48s)]
*  real culture to build the political party. And that's been frankly, you know, like, if I've [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3276.7200000000003s)]
*  been setting myself on fire about one thing down here for the last decade, it's been that which is [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3281.04s)]
*  if we're ever going to get Florida to a better place. And I might even say at this point, [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3284.96s)]
*  getting a place for like, we're competitive in 26, 28. I'm talking about a better place to make [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3288.56s)]
*  sure that Jared Moskowitz gets reelected and that, you know, you know, Congressman Frost, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3292.56s)]
*  you know, can grow and, you know, I can just kind of win seats at the local congressional level. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3297.28s)]
*  We still need to invest in that permanent infrastructure at the partisan level. We've [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3301.68s)]
*  just never really done it. So in your piece for the bulwark, you offer to see, you do talk broadly, [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3304.88s)]
*  I should recommend everyone should read it. It's a it's it offers a lot of like a lot of very [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3309.84s)]
*  interesting thoughts about where the party has been, where it's going. You offer some specific [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3314.08s)]
*  tactical recommendations, which I will summarize here. You should feel free to correct my summary, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3318.08s)]
*  but they include spending more money early in campaigns, using data more, less smartly, [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3322.96s)]
*  more smartly. I'll let you explain that one. And sort of diversifying the number of groups who are [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3331.6s)]
*  campaigning on behalf of the nominees sort of in the Super PAC universe. So can you maybe sort of [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3337.2799999999997s)]
*  explain what you're what you're arguing for here? Yeah, no, it's funny. So, you know, I ran Super PAC [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3342.4s)]
*  in 2020 and sort of a little bit in 2024, Call United the country. And it's one of these things. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3347.28s)]
*  I never thought I would ever run a Super PAC until my, you know, our mutual friend, Greg Schultz, [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3352.64s)]
*  called me at like nine thirty on a Friday night at a friend's 40th birthday party in a weak moment [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3356.56s)]
*  of weakness. I said yes. And it's a great lesson about not answering phone calls at that hour after [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3361.28s)]
*  five or six beers. And, you know, what was interesting about 2020 and when you guys had [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3366.96s)]
*  puff on me or this is kind of what drove that, you know, David talked about the infrastructure [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3371.04s)]
*  that existed in 2020. And again, I don't have any experience before that. I never ran one of these [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3375.68s)]
*  things. But in 2020, you know, there wasn't really a primary Super PAC. And what was interesting [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3379.52s)]
*  about that is it forced all of us to kind of figure out together how to support the how to support, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3385.52s)]
*  you know, then Vice President Biden. It brought lots of interesting voices to the table. You know, [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3390.8s)]
*  like, for example, I never had known a woman named Adrienne Schopchire who runs BlackPak. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3395.44s)]
*  I never met her until 2020. She's one of the smartest people I've ever talked to in my life. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3400.16s)]
*  And because of that lack of sort of singular entity, you know, her voice was elevated in ways [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3405.04s)]
*  that it certainly wasn't this cycle. And I think that, you know, we bet that Biden benefited from [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3410.56s)]
*  having that, you know, that chorus of people on the outside, all raising money, all working together. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3415.4399999999996s)]
*  It was hard for donors. Donors hated it because they would get 35 pitch calls instead of one. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3420.48s)]
*  But in the end, like, you had so many more voices with so many more sort of views at these tables. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3425.52s)]
*  And I think collectively, we ended up in a really good place. So for example, we learned, [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3431.3599999999997s)]
*  we ran solely pro-Joe Biden ads. That was our lane in 2020. American Bridge ran these ads where they [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3435.68s)]
*  would find former Trump voters talking about why they were voting for Biden. Well, what we found [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3444.48s)]
*  is that our ads and their ads were really good. Our ads, if they were on the same buy schedule as [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3448.48s)]
*  their ads, were amazing because we would tee up people talking about why they were not leaving [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3454.0s)]
*  Trump. And then, you know, you would fast forward to us. And so you had, I hate the word synergy, [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3458.96s)]
*  but you had kind of that thing that happened because you had that. Whereas this cycle, you know, [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3464.32s)]
*  I mean, I like a lot of those guys are all friends of ours at Future Forward, but like they had a [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3468.8s)]
*  theory of the case. And if you weren't part of their theory, you just weren't at the table. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3472.56s)]
*  And, you know, and in the end, I mean, like they believe the science says spend money late, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3478.4s)]
*  you know, I totally agree. Like running ads late, you know, something we all do. But like [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3483.52s)]
*  the foundation was so bad, you know, and I think that, you know, the folks made this point on your [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3487.76s)]
*  boat, on your pod last week. Like we were in such a bad place to begin with that I don't care how [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3491.92s)]
*  much money you put in, you couldn't move the foundation. Whereas you go back to say 2012, [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3497.28s)]
*  like the work that was done by Priorities and Bill and those guys to define Romney in the spring [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3501.6800000000003s)]
*  just made it easier for all of us in the fall to go do our jobs. And that was, you know, my [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3508.56s)]
*  frustration. You know, I think that I think had we run sort of, for example, a bunch of anti Trump [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3512.4s)]
*  ads in the spring of 2024, like we might have been in a place to actually close the deal in the fall, [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3519.2s)]
*  but the floor was so low. This one is so hard because like, at least there was a ton of pro [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3525.36s)]
*  Biden spending early, right in 2023, Future Forward and the Biden campaign spent 10s of millions of [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3531.36s)]
*  dollars to do it and moved literally nothing, right? Any person you talked to said move nothing. Now [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3535.92s)]
*  it's like, what's the right answer? Is that because it was too early? Is it because [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3541.44s)]
*  people's minds were made up on Joe Biden at the time and nothing was going to change anyone's mind? [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3545.12s)]
*  It's fair. Was it the ads were just, they were like the right strategy, wrong execution because [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3549.52s)]
*  the ads were bad. You know, I generally agree with you. Like I've heard several people all associated [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3555.6s)]
*  with the Harris campaign and other super PACs make the same point that Plouffe and Jen made to me. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3560.2400000000002s)]
*  And you're making now that diversity is better, right? You just, it's sort of, you have more fail [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3565.36s)]
*  safes in the system where if one, and I'm not arguing that Future Forward, what they were doing [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3572.2400000000002s)]
*  was wrong or their theory was wrong, but if you have more people, you have more theories, you're [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3576.4s)]
*  less likely, you have your eggs in multiple baskets. But then it's also hard to set like, [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3581.1200000000003s)]
*  this is why I find this election so hard to talk about because there are all these tactical things [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3586.7200000000003s)]
*  that we can debate till the end of time that we did, that the Harris campaign did wrong, [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3591.2s)]
*  the rest of us did wrong. But to any of those add up to victory, hard to say, right? Just it's like, [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3595.3599999999997s)]
*  like it's close, but it wasn't that, like it was like close in margin. But when you look at the [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3603.12s)]
*  movement among groups, it was so widespread that it's hard, it's hard to get to, it's hard to argue [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3607.2s)]
*  that like more money wins this race for her, but does more money make it closer? Is more money [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3612.08s)]
*  better than less money? Probably like hard to say, right? Yeah. And I think, you know, part of why [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3616.72s)]
*  the first line of my blog or piece for bulwark was essentially like, I don't want to talk about [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3620.48s)]
*  2024 anymore. And I know I talked about it a piece, but you know, my frustration has been, I think [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3624.08s)]
*  we've gotten to a place where, you know, I mean, we're very cyclical, it's like, let's collections, [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3628.56s)]
*  but like, you know, we've had some macro level trends that, you know, in part because, you know, [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3633.76s)]
*  frankly, Biden was old and a lot of people were kind of, that was baked in. Some of his Trump [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3638.88s)]
*  being what he is, but like the macro level trends, for example, with Hispanics, that didn't start [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3643.28s)]
*  today. The macro level trends with non-college whites, that didn't start today. And I think my [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3647.84s)]
*  point on a lot of this stuff is, A, we have to get back to some basic organizing, some early [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3654.1600000000003s)]
*  organizing. I do think in particularly in some of these communities that we consider to be base [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3657.44s)]
*  communities, that we do need to spend more money communicating earlier. We have to treat voters, [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3662.2400000000002s)]
*  so I think we've treated by, you know, particularly just a turnout target is persuasion. And that part [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3667.2000000000003s)]
*  of the point I made about the data thing is, you know, we've gotten to this. Yeah, please, [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3673.04s)]
*  make that point for our listeners. Yeah. So, you know, for, you know, your average, you know, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3676.64s)]
*  way we look at data as a party, your average voter is going to have a score from one to a hundred, [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3680.32s)]
*  one being, you know, 1% that are going to vote for our candidate, a hundred being the sure thing. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3684.56s)]
*  And we tend to sort of chop up the electorate by that way. And so, you know, if you're, for example, [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3689.2000000000003s)]
*  a African-American male who's voted in four elections in a row and has a primary voting [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3694.96s)]
*  history, like you may have a persuasion score of a hundred, we think you're going to vote for us. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3699.6800000000003s)]
*  So we don't talk to you anymore. And except to make sure you vote. Well, you know, if we're not [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3703.68s)]
*  talking to you anymore and the other side is talking to you, you know, that's not going to [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3709.12s)]
*  work out well for us. And I think, you know, we've had some chunks of our electorate that we've, [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3713.68s)]
*  frankly, just, I mean, have ignored because the data tells us that we don't have to worry about [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3717.52s)]
*  talking to them. And I think at the same time, and, you know, Stanford, you know, the Obama year is [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3722.56s)]
*  like, one of the things that our guy doesn't get enough credit for, you guys campaign don't get enough [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3726.3999999999996s)]
*  credit for, is he kept the floor in a lot of these places very high, you know, and in part [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3730.24s)]
*  because, you know, and frankly, we had money so you could communicate widely, but like, you know, [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3736.8799999999997s)]
*  take the panhandle of Florida, you know, very conservative area. I mean, you know, I look at [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3740.72s)]
*  where we were versus where Harris was, and it's not changed dramatically, it's still white, still [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3746.7999999999997s)]
*  non-college, but he, you know, we spent the money there, put the people on the ground there to keep [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3752.4799999999996s)]
*  those floors high. And, you know, nowadays, like, if you were to look at data, they'd be like, oh, [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3758.0s)]
*  you know, that area always was Republican, it's a waste of your time and your money, so you don't [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3762.96s)]
*  spend any money there. Well, all of a sudden, the floor has gone from 40% to 25%. And so my point is, [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3766.0s)]
*  like, I just, for me, it's, you know, I'm not a smart guy, I'm smart enough to add up to 50%. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3771.6s)]
*  Like, if we're not talking to enough people to make sure we're getting to that number, then [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3776.32s)]
*  we're not going to win very many elections. And so I think we have to catch a broader net. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3781.76s)]
*  And we have to kind of sometimes accept where the median voter is, even if it's not where we want [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3786.7999999999997s)]
*  him to be, you know, it's, you know, just my view of the world. One question before I let you go, [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3790.56s)]
*  because I know you got a flight to catch, but just the real canary in the coal mine for Florida [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3795.92s)]
*  in the country is the massive shift in the Latino vote. As someone who saw that first hand, [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3800.24s)]
*  what recommendations would you have for the party to begin to not just stem that tide, but reverse [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3805.6s)]
*  it? Yeah, I mean, first of all, I mean, if we don't do this as a party, we are not going to [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3811.04s)]
*  elect presidents. I mean, I think I think we're senators, right? I mean, I think I mean, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3814.72s)]
*  because I think the other thing that's really important to keep in mind here is that the next [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3819.2799999999997s)]
*  redistricting, our reapportionment after the next census is going to change the map in fundamental [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3822.3999999999996s)]
*  ways. The path to 270 through Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan will be a path to like 255 [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3827.68s)]
*  to 257. So we're going to have to win Nevada's we're gonna have to win Arizona's and Georgia's [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3834.3999999999996s)]
*  and potentially Ford's, North Carolina's all these states have much bigger Hispanic populations than [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3838.8799999999997s)]
*  you have in the upper Midwest. So a we have to do it. You know, I think I think a lot of I mean, [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3843.12s)]
*  the upside is, listen, man, like before Barack Obama, we weren't necessarily doing great with [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3847.7599999999998s)]
*  Hispanics either. I mean, we were able to change that pretty quickly. A we had an amazing candidate, [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3852.16s)]
*  generational candidate, but also, I think just kind of getting back to redefining who we are. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3858.08s)]
*  I mean, I think this perception that we are a party that is more focused on sort of niche social [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3862.96s)]
*  issues. And again, I'm not saying we shouldn't stand up for marginalized, we absolutely should. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3867.8399999999997s)]
*  That's what makes us all Democrats. But redefining that, you know, we are there, [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3870.88s)]
*  you know, whether it's, you know, for helping people go to college or tech degrees, I mean, [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3875.04s)]
*  just getting back to those core issues, which is going to require us to spend a lot of money. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3878.8s)]
*  But I think we have to just engage in redefining who we are in those communities, it's going to be [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3884.7200000000003s)]
*  slow, it's going to be painful. Again, I think that, you know, I think that some of the work that I [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3888.6400000000003s)]
*  mean, I'm critical of a lot of things. I'm not critical of like what the DNC has been doing on [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3892.7200000000003s)]
*  the ground in a lot of these states. I think it's been very good. We should build on that going [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3896.8s)]
*  forward. But I mean, we'd have to I mean, it's just gonna have to claw back and redefine who we are [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3900.24s)]
*  as a party with those voters. Steve Schale, thank you so much. We will count on you to turn Florida [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3905.2799999999997s)]
*  back around in the next 48 years. So it's great to talk to you. I'm getting old, man. I'll do what I [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3910.16s)]
*  can do. Good to talk to you, brother. Thanks, buddy. That's our show for today. We'll be back [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3914.4799999999996s)]
*  with a new episode on Tuesday morning. Have a great weekend, everyone. Bye, everyone. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxtJDeiTHZU&t=3918.0s)]
