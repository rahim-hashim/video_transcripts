Video Description: Trump kicks off a new war on Christmas—this time as part of a broader assault on the U.S. economy and consumers. Meanwhile, in the first White House shakeup of his second term, Trump announces that Signal-happy National Security Adviser Mike Waltz is out, and Marco Rubio is in (at least on a temporary basis). Jon and Dan discuss why Trump made the move, his admission that his tariffs will probably lead to higher prices—and toy shortages—and that he could, in fact, get Kilmar Abrego Garcia back from El Salvador if he felt like it. Then, Jon speaks with Governor Gretchen Whitmer about why she thinks it's important to work with Trump sometimes, even if it means embarrassing photo ops—and getting flak from other Democrats.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Trump Says He Will Raise Prices On Children's Toys Through Tariffs (Yes, Really)
**Pod Save America:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU)
*  I feel like you should turn Favro into a verb. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=0.0s)]
*  Favroed? What does that mean? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2.0s)]
*  Whenever you beat someone in a Twitter fight, I'll just respond with Favroed! [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4.0s)]
*  Six exclamation points. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=8.0s)]
*  Please don't do that. Please don't do that. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=9.0s)]
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Jon Favro. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=11.0s)]
*  I'm Dan Pfeiffer. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=13.0s)]
*  On today's show, Trump reacts to more bad economic news by telling Americans to stop buying our kids so many toys. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=14.0s)]
*  It's a real thing. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=21.0s)]
*  He also admits that he's not following a Supreme Court order, in part because [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=23.0s)]
*  he seems to believe that a photoshopped picture of Kilmer or Brego Garcia's knuckles is real. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=26.0s)]
*  We'll talk about what's going on in our elderly president's big beautiful brain. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=31.0s)]
*  We'll also talk about how Democrats are responding to Trump's first hundred days, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=35.0s)]
*  including my conversation with Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=39.0s)]
*  who told me she believes we're in the middle of a constitutional crisis [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=42.0s)]
*  just one day after she hugged the man responsible before an event where she thanked him for saving a Michigan Air Force base. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=46.0s)]
*  Lots going on with Gretchen Whitmer. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=52.0s)]
*  So tune in for that later. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=54.0s)]
*  But let's start with the breaking news. Dan, we got a shakeup. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=56.0s)]
*  We got our first big White House shakeup. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=59.0s)]
*  A shakeup? What's happening? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=61.0s)]
*  Trump announced that National Security Advisor Mike Walz, who started the world's most famous group chat, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=62.0s)]
*  is being nominated for U.N. Ambassador and that Secretary of State Marco Rubio will also serve as interim National Security Advisor. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=67.0s)]
*  It's been reported that Walz's deputy, Alex Wong, will also step down from his job. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=76.0s)]
*  The news came as a surprise to just about everyone in Washington, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=81.0s)]
*  including Rubio's State Department spokesperson, Tammy Bruce, who found out in the middle of her briefing. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=85.0s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=91.0s)]
*  The president has just written on Truth Social that Mike Walz is going to become the new U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=92.0s)]
*  Well, there you go. Fabulous. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=99.0s)]
*  And in addition to that, he says that in the interim, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as National Security Advisor while continuing his strong leadership at the State Department. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=102.0s)]
*  Do you know how long he's going to be serving in both roles? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=113.0s)]
*  It is clear that I just heard this from you. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=117.0s)]
*  I'm no expert here, but is that what usually happens in the briefings? The spokespeople learn news from the reporters? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=121.0s)]
*  When it does, it's very interesting. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=129.0s)]
*  So the guy who started Signalgate is now up for a job that requires a Senate confirmation hearing. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=132.0s)]
*  Little Marco gets a second job and more opportunities for Trump to emasculate him in public. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=139.0s)]
*  In Trump's pal, Laura Loomer, the proud Islamophobe and 9-11 truther, is taking credit for Walz and Wong's departure. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=146.0s)]
*  She texted a one word message to Politico, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=154.0s)]
*  Loomer. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=157.0s)]
*  What do you make of all this? Where would you like to begin? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=159.0s)]
*  With loomer as a verb? Yeah, that's a whole that's a whole thing. Yeah, it's loomers people. That's great. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=162.0s)]
*  I feel like you should turn Favro into a verb. Favro. What does that mean? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=168.0s)]
*  Whenever you beat someone in a Twitter fight, I'll just respond with Favro! Six exclamation points. Please don't do that. Please don't do that. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=172.0s)]
*  Here's what I think to make of this whole thing. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=179.0s)]
*  It is not unusual, although 102 days is an unusually short period of time, but it's not unusual for a president to have to make a personnel change early. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=182.0s)]
*  You know, you hire these people, maybe they fit in, maybe they're not the right person. You got to make a change. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=191.0s)]
*  So hiring the wrong person is not the sin here. The sin is how they executed this. Just like do the timeline of events here. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=195.0s)]
*  Well, Signalgate was weeks ago when everyone called for us firing. Trump defended him, said it wasn't a big deal, sent out every Republican in America to defend him. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=203.0s)]
*  Then Michael Walls goes out on TV this morning to show for the administration. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=211.0s)]
*  Then it is leaked to disgraced white ring journalist Mark Halperin that these firings are happening. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=215.0s)]
*  Then no one in the White House seems to know, so it takes a long time for anyone of consequence to be able to confirm it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=221.0s)]
*  Then hours later, as you pointed out, Trump announces via True Social that Michael Walls is going to become the ambassador to the United Nations. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=227.0s)]
*  A job that is vacant 102 days administration because Donald Trump had to pull the nomination of the person of Elise Stefanik because like Mike Walls, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=235.0s)]
*  he had nominated a bunch of people from the most from the House during the most narrow House majority in like a century. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=244.0s)]
*  There's Senate confirmation for that. It is also a job where it's bad to invite reporters to group chats involving top secret information. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=250.0s)]
*  He has no plan for who is going to replace Mike Walls, so he appoints the Secretary of State. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=257.0s)]
*  A person who has an entirely other job that requires them to travel the world, making it very hard to be the interim national security advisor, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=264.0s)]
*  a job that largely requires you to be in the White House running a policy process. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=272.0s)]
*  Well, it requires you to be in the White House unless you conduct most of your job over signal. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=276.0s)]
*  That is true. That is a good point. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=281.0s)]
*  And then the Tammy Bruce that he points Marco Rubio that but no one in the States for Marco Rubio might have learned in that moment with Tammy Bruce that he was the interim national security advisor. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=283.0s)]
*  I think that's probably what this is. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=293.0s)]
*  It's just there are so many hard things that happen for presidents, so many tough decisions, so many tough things. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=296.0s)]
*  And when they can they screw up the easy stuff, it should make you really worried about the hard stuff. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=302.0s)]
*  And they fumbled every bit of this through the process. It's just it's a giant mess. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=306.0s)]
*  What happened to Suzy Wiles running a tight ship? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=311.0s)]
*  Yeah, I just I never really bought that one, John. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=314.0s)]
*  Even around the 100 days, there's some interview where she's like, yeah, that hurt. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=317.0s)]
*  She succeeded because she never tries to calm Trump down or change things or anything. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=322.0s)]
*  But she does. She's really good at creating a process and like getting things in order for the process. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=327.0s)]
*  I guess it seems like this process got away from her a little bit. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=333.0s)]
*  It seems like they all do. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=336.0s)]
*  So everyone obviously like went right to signal gate on why Walt's lost his job, got a promotion. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=338.0s)]
*  Who knows what it is? But, you know, the Atlantic did some reporting on this. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=345.0s)]
*  And apparently, like signal gate was just one of many issues that he had. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=349.0s)]
*  And but way before signal gate, there was this view that he wasn't MAGA enough for the rest of the crew, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=355.0s)]
*  that he was too much of a neocon, too much of a hawk for this. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=362.0s)]
*  Hence the loomering. Hence the loomering. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=366.0s)]
*  He didn't play well with others, couldn't manage his staff well. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=369.0s)]
*  Apparently, not only did he piss off Laura Loomer because I guess he wasn't enough of a fucking lunatic, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=372.0s)]
*  but he pissed off Susie Wiles, speaking of Susie Wiles, because he treated her like staff reportedly [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=378.0s)]
*  when when that's not what you do to the White House chief of staff because she's the chief of staff. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=385.0s)]
*  Could you could you read me back Susie Wiles' title again? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=390.0s)]
*  She would be the chief of staff. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=394.0s)]
*  I remember one of I think it was maybe Dennis McDonough telling us he'd gotten some advice from former chiefs of staff. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=397.0s)]
*  And the best chiefs of staff are the ones who think the emphasis goes on staff, not chief. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=403.0s)]
*  Yeah. Seems like Susie Wiles falls in the former category. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=407.0s)]
*  It was also funny right after this Mike Waltz announcement. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=413.0s)]
*  There was a there's a picture of him that Reuters caught from yesterday's cabinet meeting, Wednesday's cabinet meeting or Tuesday, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=419.0s)]
*  whenever the fuck it was. And it's just a picture of him on signal. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=428.0s)]
*  And they zoom in and you can see he's got a conversation with JD Vance and one with Marco Rubio and a call from Tulsi Gabbard [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=434.0s)]
*  and another message from Steve Witkoff. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=442.0s)]
*  So he just has his phone out in view of the cameras texting people on signal. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=446.0s)]
*  Yes, that is irresponsible. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=451.0s)]
*  As we've said before, it's A, responsible to signal. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=453.0s)]
*  It's B, responsible to signal on live television. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=456.0s)]
*  But it's also a violation of the Presidential Records Act. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=459.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=461.0s)]
*  They're doing all of this to avoid creating records that could then be subpoenaed one day by non-obsequious prosecutors or a Democratic majority or whatever else. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=462.0s)]
*  That keeps getting glossed over by the EDSC of adding Jeff Goldberg to the group chat. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=473.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah, we've skipped over the whole Presidential Records Act. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=477.0s)]
*  You required all that bullshit. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=482.0s)]
*  What are your thoughts on whether Mike Waltz actually gets confirmed to be the UN ambassador? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=484.0s)]
*  Because he's now going to have to do a confirmation hearing. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=491.0s)]
*  He's answered some reporters questions or he used to answer a few reporters questions about signal. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=494.0s)]
*  A lot of what he said to the reporters was just lies. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=500.0s)]
*  Now he's going to have to go to a Senate confirmation hearing, be under oath and answer even more questions about signal, which is probably not great for him, not great for Pete Hegseth, not great for any of them. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=503.0s)]
*  You raising these questions has happened before anyone in the Trump administration raised those questions. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=516.0s)]
*  Unless this was like punishment. Maybe it's not a promotion. Maybe it's just punishment. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=521.0s)]
*  I think this is Donald Trump realizing that he asked this guy to give up his congressional career for 102 days of humiliating servitude and was just looking for a place to put him. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=525.0s)]
*  Also, there was some reporting on this before that one of the reasons why Trump did not fire him in the outset was he didn't want to give his critics a win. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=536.0s)]
*  So by being able to pretend that this is some sort of promotion to this necessary but vacant position, he can continue to live in that reality. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=543.0s)]
*  Will he actually get confirmed? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=551.0s)]
*  I think that's an open question. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=553.0s)]
*  This is an easy, not an easy, Trump doesn't care about this guy. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=554.0s)]
*  So this isn't like sinking RFK Jr. or Hegseth. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=558.0s)]
*  Like, will he be able to answer those questions under oath? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=561.0s)]
*  Will that go well? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=564.0s)]
*  Good question. Who knows? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=565.0s)]
*  I mean, one thing's for sure. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=567.0s)]
*  It guarantees that the whole signal scandal is in the news for another day. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=569.0s)]
*  Someday down the line, whatever the hearing is. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=574.0s)]
*  So that's fun. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=576.0s)]
*  We had actually, people had stopped talking about signal. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=577.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=579.0s)]
*  And so Trump waited to the exact moment when it finally faded from the news to then bring it back, fire this guy and bring it right back up again. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=580.0s)]
*  Just master communicator that one. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=586.0s)]
*  Well, excited for Marco for his new job. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=588.0s)]
*  Just more more opportunities to be humiliated. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=590.0s)]
*  Can I give you a take on this? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=593.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=594.0s)]
*  I think this is the way in which he gets Marco out and Steve Whitkoff in. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=595.0s)]
*  Oh, like for good for good from from all the jobs or does Marco also has a third job, by the way, that we should mention, which he is the National Archivist. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=598.0s)]
*  Does he is he no longer running USAID? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=608.0s)]
*  Well, USAID is like officially done. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=610.0s)]
*  I mean, it is like he doesn't exist. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=612.0s)]
*  Whatever foreign aid we still have is within the State Department. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=614.0s)]
*  So in that sense, he's there. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=616.0s)]
*  But yeah, no, he's like the security guard at a zombie mall. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=618.0s)]
*  Basically, he's got all the important jobs, Marco. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=620.0s)]
*  But I think what I think happens here is he does his job for a while. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=622.0s)]
*  Trump decides he is he should do the job. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=626.0s)]
*  He gives up forces him to give up a State Department job. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=630.0s)]
*  Whitkoff comes in and now Trump is the National Archivist. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=633.0s)]
*  And now Trump has his punching bag with him every single day. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=636.0s)]
*  The problem is, it's hard to humiliate Rubio when he's off in different time zones all the time. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=639.0s)]
*  Now he will be down the hall. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=644.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, the only way that he could humiliate Rubio more at this point is to put an actual dog collar around him and have a chain. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=646.0s)]
*  It's just where Rubio is just walking next to Trump on all fours. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=653.0s)]
*  I mean, I mean, get that for the pot that pot art. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=658.0s)]
*  This is the first hundred days. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=661.0s)]
*  I hope someone is going is going to an AI image creator and see if we can get that made. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=662.0s)]
*  I'm thinking of the thinking of the scene, the end of the movie. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=667.0s)]
*  What was it? This is the end. Remember? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=673.0s)]
*  Remember the one with you know, the scene I'm talking about. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=675.0s)]
*  Seth Rogen. Yes. Yeah. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=678.0s)]
*  Anyway, that's what I'm thinking about. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=680.0s)]
*  Let's get to something that really matters. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=682.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's new war on Christmas, which is part of his broader war on the U.S. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=684.0s)]
*  economy and people who buy things on Wednesday, we got the news that the economy actually shrank over the first few months of 2025, despite being projected to grow to save you all the trouble of Googling the official definition of a recession. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=689.0s)]
*  It's two consecutive quarters of the economy shrinking. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=702.0s)]
*  So one down, one to go. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=706.0s)]
*  The worst part, the GDP data that we got is from January through March. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=709.0s)]
*  So before Trump announced his Liberation Day tariffs that are currently wreaking havoc all over the world in the markets, tanking consumer confidence, causing all kinds of U.S. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=714.0s)]
*  companies to warn us about empty shelves, higher prices, factory closings, layoffs. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=724.0s)]
*  Trump was asked about all this during during the cabinet meeting where Mike Waltz was very busy on signal. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=730.0s)]
*  And boy, boy, did Trump nail the answer. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=737.0s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=739.0s)]
*  Core GDP. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=740.0s)]
*  And this is, you know, you probably saw some numbers today. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=741.0s)]
*  And I have to start off by saying that's Biden. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=745.0s)]
*  That's not Trump because we came in on January. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=748.0s)]
*  This is quarterly numbers. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=750.0s)]
*  So this is Biden. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=752.0s)]
*  And you can even say the next quarter is sort of Biden because it doesn't just happen on a daily or an hourly basis. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=754.0s)]
*  They made a trillion dollars with Biden, a trillion dollars, even a trillion won with Biden selling us stuff. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=760.0s)]
*  Much of it we don't need. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=768.0s)]
*  You know, somebody said, oh, the shelves are going to be open. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=769.0s)]
*  Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know, and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=772.0s)]
*  But this is a man who told Jeffrey Goldberg and Ashley Parker, Michael Scherer when they were in the Oval Office to look up at the ceiling because it's covered in 24 karat gold. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=780.0s)]
*  Who needs who needs the extra dolls for Christmas? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=794.0s)]
*  So an actual line that the man said, the president of the United States, as you might imagine, this one's breaking through even the New York Post. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=799.0s)]
*  Rupert Murdoch's New York Post made it Thursday's cover story with the headline skimp on the Barbie. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=810.0s)]
*  And that is fucking great. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=816.0s)]
*  I mean, they know what they're doing at the New York Post. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=819.0s)]
*  They're very good at how to hand it to them. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=821.0s)]
*  They're really bad at other things. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=823.0s)]
*  But headlines they're very good at skimp on the Barbie. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=825.0s)]
*  Trump admits that tariffs will raise some prices, cause shortages. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=828.0s)]
*  Donald Trump has obviously said a countless number of dumb and politically damaging things in the decade. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=832.0s)]
*  We've been covering him. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=839.0s)]
*  This has to be in the top five, top 10, top 20. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=841.0s)]
*  What do you think? Top 10, at least. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=846.0s)]
*  It would be mentally painful for us and the audience to try to go through them one by one to figure out to rank them. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=848.0s)]
*  That would be bad content. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=855.0s)]
*  I think, I mean, dumb is impossible. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=857.0s)]
*  But if you're actually, if you're also including politically damaging, you know, the guy gets elected again against the odds because they think, well, at least, at least he'll be good for the economy. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=859.0s)]
*  And he'll bring prices down. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=872.0s)]
*  And then he's like, fuck you. You don't need that many toys. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=874.0s)]
*  Well, in the moment, it's just another crazy thing he said. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=878.0s)]
*  But as the weeks go on and the shelves get empty and the prices go up, this becomes more painful. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=882.0s)]
*  And then when you put it in the context of you're telling people to do without toys, to be willing that you should just suck it up and pay more for things. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=888.0s)]
*  At the same time that he is trying to pass a massive tax cut for rich people paid for by cutting health care for working class people and stuffing his pockets full of billions of dollars of foreign money. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=897.0s)]
*  Like you need that in context. And this will be one of those things. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=911.0s)]
*  Well, will this fade away like all the other Trump things? Well, that's actually something we all control. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=913.0s)]
*  Right. And so it's up to Democrats and everyone else to remind people of this when the shelves are empty. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=917.0s)]
*  Right. We are weeks away from this. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=922.0s)]
*  The last container ships filled with stuff that was pre tariffs have come. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=924.0s)]
*  The next ones are going to be empty or with more expensive stuff. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=928.0s)]
*  There's just an announcement today that Microsoft is raising the price of Xbox's by 25 percent. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=931.0s)]
*  And the stuff that we need for the holiday season, those toys, that is the stuff coming now and in the coming weeks, all under the tariff regime. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=936.0s)]
*  That line about the toys, which you could combine with any number of statements from Donald Trump and the rest of his administration on like we don't need cheap goods. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=945.0s)]
*  We don't need TVs. Americans are buying too much shit. Who cares? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=954.0s)]
*  Little bit of pain. No big deal. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=958.0s)]
*  I mean, there's just line after line like this. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=961.0s)]
*  These should be burned into the minds of the American people so that they can recite them in their sleep. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=964.0s)]
*  That is that is how much content ads, everything else the Democrats should be putting out on this. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=970.0s)]
*  Like you shouldn't be able to go anywhere without hearing that line from Donald Trump about the toys, especially around billboards outside of targets and Walmarts. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=975.0s)]
*  That's what we need. Oh, man. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=986.0s)]
*  Stephen Miller tried to clean this up at the at his briefing today where he was screaming about how children must learn to love America in our schools. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=988.0s)]
*  And someone asked him about this and he said, if you have look if you have a choice between a doll from China that might have lead paint on it and not be well constructed and a doll from America that's made with great environmental standards, which Trump is repealing all of them, you'd probably be willing to pay more for the American doll. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=997.0s)]
*  There are no American dolls. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1017.0s)]
*  I think I'm there. I think the American doll might be made in China to check on that. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1021.0s)]
*  I think like 80% of toys that we buy in this country. I think it's higher than that. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1026.0s)]
*  Yes. It would be nice if we had a doll industry in America to supplement these Chinese dolls and maybe it'd be a little more expensive to buy high quality non lead paint like union made dolls. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1030.0s)]
*  But those don't exist. Yeah, that's not a thing. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1043.0s)]
*  Doesn't exist. That's what Stephen Miller is saying. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1046.0s)]
*  Three Trump officials told Rolling Stone that they're already stockpiling goods at Target. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1049.0s)]
*  Bulk toilet paper, food, household supplies. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1056.0s)]
*  They're also stashing cash reserves in their homes in D.C. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1060.0s)]
*  And and the reason they're doing this is because and this is a quote one of them gave Rolling Stone. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1063.0s)]
*  It would be stupid not to explain the cash reserves. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1068.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, I mean, because I understand the other stuff. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1073.0s)]
*  What do we not know that they know about the banking system right now? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1075.0s)]
*  I know that is somewhat alarming. That is somewhat alarming. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1080.0s)]
*  Also, I'm sorry, if these guys were true Trump fans, they would have been stocking themselves with Trump coins. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1083.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that is a good idea. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1088.0s)]
*  That'll yeah, the Trump meme coins. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1091.0s)]
*  That's a perfect, perfect, perfect story about the Trump economy. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1094.0s)]
*  You can't get actual things on the shelves, but you can buy the fake coins that make the president richer. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1098.0s)]
*  Perfect, perfect, perfect. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1104.0s)]
*  The U.S. Toy Association, which is what represents all the toy manufacturers in the United States, says, quote, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1105.0s)]
*  We have a frozen supply chain that is putting Christmas at risk. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1110.0s)]
*  If we don't start production soon, there's a high probability of a toy shortage this holiday season. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1113.0s)]
*  So are you going to start buying your kids toys for Christmas now? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1120.0s)]
*  I feel like I should go on Amazon tonight and start buying some toys. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1123.0s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1126.0s)]
*  I wish I could, but the odds that they were going to what they like now is what they're going to like in December. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1128.0s)]
*  You're right. I know. I know. I know. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1133.0s)]
*  Just buy some Legos. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1136.0s)]
*  What's your take on the on the effectiveness of blaming Joe Biden for this one? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1139.0s)]
*  As Trump has been doing, I would note that all the way back before he took office, before Trump took office, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1143.0s)]
*  when stocks were going up, Trump posted this is the Trump stock market because his theory then was the stock [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1149.0s)]
*  market was going up because everyone was so excited that Donald Trump got elected and was about to become president. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1155.0s)]
*  Now the stock market's down. It's Joe Biden's fault. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1159.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think this one's going to work, Joe. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1162.0s)]
*  Let me just give you three poll numbers that go at the core of the flaw in Trump's argument. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1165.0s)]
*  In the NPR PBS Marist College poll that came out last week, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1170.0s)]
*  60 percent of Americans said the current economic conditions are mostly a result of Trump's policies, while only 39 percent said he inherited them. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1174.0s)]
*  In the CBS News YouGov poll, 54 percent said that Trump's policies were more responsible for the state economy. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1180.0s)]
*  Only 21 percent said about Biden. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1186.0s)]
*  And in the Gallup poll, 89 percent of Americans say that tariffs, Trump's signature policy, will lead to higher prices. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1188.0s)]
*  I mean, yeah. Well, I guess all those Americans in the majority nailed it because that's the truth. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1196.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're exactly right. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1202.0s)]
*  I mean, it is fascinating how Trump screwed this up because, as we know all too well, for almost the entirety of Obama's first term, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1204.0s)]
*  if you ask people who was more responsible for the state of the economy, they would pick Bush over Obama. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1214.0s)]
*  Yeah, because they understood that the financial crisis happened before Obama. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1220.0s)]
*  There's a world in which Trump could have come in and like he would never actually do this, but a smart, normal human would say, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1223.0s)]
*  we didn't get in this mess overnight. It's going to take us a while to get out of it, but we're going to be working on it. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1229.0s)]
*  Instead, he declared several times from the campaign that prices would go down immediately. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1234.0s)]
*  Inflation would be vanquished. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1239.0s)]
*  And so he set expectations the wrong way and then put in place a policy designed to do the exact opposite of what he ran on. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1242.0s)]
*  And so, no, I don't think blaming Joe Biden is going to work here. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1248.0s)]
*  They are doing the old Biden strategy of get Stephen Miller out there and be like, egg prices are down and actually inflation is down and grocery prices are down. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1251.0s)]
*  It's like, all right, man, you tell us all the made up statistics you want about how great the fucking economy is when the shelves are empty and the prices have risen and the factories close and the people are laid off. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1261.0s)]
*  Guess what? We're going to know. We're going to know it's bullshit. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1272.0s)]
*  People, they see the price of eggs. They know. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1276.0s)]
*  I haven't even had the chance to talk about the Amazon story from earlier this week. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1279.0s)]
*  There was reporting on Monday that the company was considering displaying the cost of Trump's tariffs next to products on its website, which got me very excited. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1282.0s)]
*  The White House, the White House immediately went to war, calling it a hostile and political act. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1291.0s)]
*  Trump then called up his new pal, Jeff Bezos, and wouldn't you know, Amazon put out a statement saying the tariff indicator was only under consideration for Amazon Hall Marketplace, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1297.0s)]
*  which competes directly with Chinese retailers that have actually been displaying the tariff price increases. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1306.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, UPS says it's going to lay off 20,000 people in close 73 facilities because of lower volume from Amazon. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1311.0s)]
*  Some of that is preplanned, but the CEO acknowledged on an earnings call that the tariffs are creating huge uncertainty, saying the world hasn't been faced with such enormous potential impacts to trade in more than 100 years. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1319.0s)]
*  Trump's making history again. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1331.0s)]
*  Is that a Smoot Hawley reference? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1334.0s)]
*  I think it might be, yeah. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1336.0s)]
*  GM also said on Thursday that it stands to lose $4 to $5 billion in profit this year because of the tariffs. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1337.0s)]
*  Question for you. Why would it have been a hostile and political act for Amazon to let consumers know about the impacts of the tariffs that Donald Trump loves so much? [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1344.0s)]
*  I thought these tariffs are going to make us rich. It's going to make America great again. It's going to bring back manufacturing. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1355.0s)]
*  He should be proud of advertising what the tariffs are doing. Why hide them? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1361.0s)]
*  Well, I think here in the dystopian wannabe dictatorship in which we live, anything that could possibly be described as criticism of the regime is a hostile political act. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1366.0s)]
*  It's true. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1377.0s)]
*  It's why Trump is directing the Department of Justice to investigate his critics like Christopher Krebs and Miles Taylor. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1378.0s)]
*  It's why he's going after companies who he thinks don't have it share his interest. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1384.0s)]
*  It's why they're going after universities. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1389.0s)]
*  And so, yeah, of course they view this as a hostile political act. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1391.0s)]
*  Also, most importantly, it exposes the giant idiotic lie at the center of the tariff policy, which is that the foreign government pays the tariff, not you. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1393.0s)]
*  Does Bezos think a pissed off Trump could do more damage to his companies than Trump's trade war? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1402.0s)]
*  It seems to be like that's the calculation he's making by being like, oh, no, I would never do that. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1408.0s)]
*  And he's still playing nice with Trump right now. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1413.0s)]
*  Like, why not display if you really if I guess we'll see how the trade war goes as it continues. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1416.0s)]
*  But like, why not display the tariff tax next to each product? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1422.0s)]
*  I think pretty clearly Trump could do more damage to Jeff Bezos companies than the tariffs could do because Blue Origin, his space company that exists to send Katy Perry to the moon, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1426.0s)]
*  depends on government contracts. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1442.0s)]
*  Amazon gets a ton of government contracts for delivery of in logistics stuff. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1445.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. The imagine if Trump unleashed the regulatory hounds on Amazon. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1449.0s)]
*  Yeah. Right. The FTC, all of those things. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1454.0s)]
*  So they could do real lasting damage if you assume that this trade war has some end date. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1456.0s)]
*  And Amazon is also a is a reseller of other people's products. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1462.0s)]
*  The people who is really in their interest to do it is the people who make and sell the products themselves like car companies. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1467.0s)]
*  Right. So you understand like Amazon, you know, whether they're not necessarily the one like they're going to lose business over this, we can lose business, whether the tariffs are indicated or not. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1474.0s)]
*  If you're if you're a company that makes a product whose cost is about to go up, you want to show your people, your customers, why that price is going up, that it's not just you jacking prices up. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1482.0s)]
*  Amazon, one way or the other, doesn't, you know, they may not care that much. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1493.0s)]
*  That makes sense. They should care. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1496.0s)]
*  That would be the right thing to do. But yeah, that's not really that's never really been their deal. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1497.0s)]
*  So Bezos still and still in Trump's pocket for now. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1501.0s)]
*  Yes, working out. It's working out great for him. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1504.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's crushing it. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1505.0s)]
*  Pots of America is brought to you by Haya. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1507.0s)]
*  Typical children's vitamins are basically candy in disguise, filled with two teaspoons of sugar, unhealthy chemicals and other gummy additives growing kids should never eat. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1508.0s)]
*  That's why Haya created a super powered chewable vitamin. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1516.0s)]
*  While many children's vitamins are filled with five grams of sugar, which is known to contribute to a variety of health issues, including making your kids bounce off the wall for a few hours. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1519.0s)]
*  Haya is made with zero sugar and zero gummy additives. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1527.0s)]

*  Emily's picky too. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1541.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's why. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1543.0s)]
*  So butter noodles for the two of them? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1544.0s)]
*  Yeah, butter noodles is I come home and there's just oh, it's butter noodles again. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1545.0s)]
*  So that's why I'm always eating on my own. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1550.0s)]
*  That's sad. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1552.0s)]
*  Teddy will eat anything. Teddy is going to be the neater like me. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1553.0s)]
*  That's cool. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1556.0s)]

*  I'm really getting into. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1720.0s)]
*  How about the science of sleeping well? [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1721.0s)]
*  No, none of that. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1723.0s)]

*  In Helix, intuitive understanding of relativity. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1727.0s)]
*  Like not just to know how it works, but to have it feel intuitive. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1731.0s)]
*  It's so unintuitive, you know? [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1735.0s)]
*  It's unintuitive. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1737.0s)]
*  The speed of light. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1739.0s)]

*  The Helix lineup offers 20 unique mattresses, including models with memory foam layers to provide optimal pressure relief if you sleep on your side. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1742.0s)]

*  I'll tell you what's not relative. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1754.0s)]
*  The quality of the sleep you're going to get on this Helix mattress. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1755.0s)]

*  Trump also made some non tariff news during his 100 days week celebration that might be of interest to the Supreme Court. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1792.0s)]
*  During a contentious Oval Office interview with ABC's Terry Moran, Trump was asked about the Supreme Court's order that he facilitate the release of Kilmar Obrego Garcia. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1799.0s)]
*  Here's how it went. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1808.0s)]
*  The order from the Supreme Court stands into our country illegally. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1809.0s)]
*  You could get him back. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1813.0s)]
*  There's a phone on this desk. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1814.0s)]
*  I could. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1815.0s)]
*  You could pick it up and all the power of the presidency. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1816.0s)]
*  You could call up the president of El Salvador and say send him back right now. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1818.0s)]
*  And if he were the gentleman that you say he is, I would do that. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1821.0s)]
*  But the court has ordered you to facilitate that. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1824.0s)]
*  I'm not the one making this decision. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1827.0s)]
*  We have lawyers that don't want to do this. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1829.0s)]
*  But the buck stops in this office. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1832.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1833.0s)]
*  I follow the law. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1835.0s)]
*  You want me to follow the law? [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1836.0s)]
*  If I were the president that just wanted to do anything, I'd probably keep him right where he is. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1837.0s)]
*  The Supreme Court. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1841.0s)]
*  And on his knuckles, he had MS-13. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1842.0s)]
*  There's a dispute over that. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1844.0s)]

*  Wait a minute. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1846.0s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1847.0s)]
*  He had MS-13 on his knuckles tattooed. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1848.0s)]
*  He had some tattoos that are interpreted that way. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1850.0s)]
*  But let's move on. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1852.0s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1853.0s)]
*  Hey, Terry, Terry, Terry. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1854.0s)]
*  He did not have the letter MS-13. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1855.0s)]
*  It says MS-13. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1858.0s)]
*  That was Photoshopped. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1859.0s)]
*  So let me just... [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1860.0s)]
*  That was Photoshopped. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1861.0s)]
*  Terry, you can't do that. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1862.0s)]
*  Hey, they're giving you the big break of a lifetime. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1863.0s)]
*  You know, you're doing the interview. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1866.0s)]
*  I picked you because frankly I never heard of you, but that's okay. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1867.0s)]
*  I picked you. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1870.0s)]
*  Terry, but you're not being very nice. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1871.0s)]
*  This is not the most important part of that, but I picked you because I didn't know who [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1874.0s)]
*  you were. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1878.0s)]
*  I think there's a chance for us, Dan. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1879.0s)]
*  That's true. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1881.0s)]
*  You know, we just got to get into the right signal. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1882.0s)]
*  Just sneak right in there. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1886.0s)]
*  So for those of you who missed this particular storyline, what happened there is at some [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1888.0s)]
*  point they had Trump in the Oval with the... [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1894.0s)]
*  There are tattoos across Kilmar Obrego Garcia's knuckles, and the White House decided to Photoshop [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1897.0s)]
*  on top of the photo of the tattoos on his knuckles MS-13 because they have decided to [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1905.0s)]
*  buy into a conspiracy that the marijuana leaf stands for M and then there's an S and then [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1911.0s)]
*  there's this that stands for the one and this that stands for the three, and they've put [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1916.0s)]
*  it all together. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1919.0s)]
*  There's a bunch of red string on a billboard somewhere, and so they gave it to Trump and [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1920.0s)]
*  he held up the picture that said MS-13. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1924.0s)]
*  There is, of course, no MS-13 on his knuckles, which you can see from any picture of him [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1926.0s)]
*  with his knuckles. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1931.0s)]
*  You can see it in any of the pictures from El Salvador. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1932.0s)]
*  Also, actual people who have conducted decades of research on MS-13, law enforcement officials [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1934.0s)]
*  who prosecuted MS-13, they say they've never seen those tattoos associated with MS-13. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1940.0s)]
*  Well, obviously. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1945.0s)]
*  Why would you possibly do that? [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1947.0s)]
*  Just like maybe they should get t-shirts and say, I am guilty. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1951.0s)]
*  Like, it's absurd. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1954.0s)]
*  I think this story has not gotten enough attention. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1956.0s)]
*  Yeah, you think? [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1959.0s)]
*  The President of the United States sat in the Oval Office and communicated to the world [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1961.0s)]
*  a Photoshopped image alleging that someone was part of a gang. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1966.0s)]
*  Like, that is, like, it's really sort of glossed by in the midst of it. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1974.0s)]
*  Like, this is incredibly... [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1978.0s)]
*  Also, we've talked about tattoos in relation to the Tren de Aragua Venezuelan migrants [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1980.0s)]
*  that they are shipping to El Salvador. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1987.0s)]
*  The government, nowhere in any of the court filings or court records or the gang worksheet [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1989.0s)]
*  that was filled out by the PG County cop that ended up getting suspended for misconduct and fired, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=1995.0s)]
*  nowhere in any of that is the government or anyone alleging that his ties, his alleged ties to MS-13 [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2002.0s)]
*  had anything to do with the tattoos. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2009.0s)]
*  The tattoos have never come up anywhere. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2011.0s)]
*  Do you think if he had gone into court that day with MS-13 tattooed on his hands, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2014.0s)]
*  would have been in dispute? [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2020.0s)]
*  No, of course not. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2022.0s)]
*  And we have the pictures from Chris Van Hollen's visit. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2024.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2028.0s)]
*  Someone Photoshopped it and then a bunch of fucking yahoos to the White House, [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2029.0s)]
*  either wittingly or unwittingly, decided to believe it and then broadcast it to the world. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2032.0s)]
*  Like, I know the president has immunity, thank you, Supreme Court, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2037.0s)]
*  but like that is defamation, like, hands down. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2042.0s)]
*  I mean, and I can't tell, like, does he truly believe this? [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2047.0s)]
*  He does. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2051.0s)]
*  Is he just lying? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2052.0s)]
*  I think he kind of truly believes it. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2053.0s)]
*  I think one of the takeaways in the Oval Office interview, Oval Office meeting with Bukele, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2054.0s)]
*  the way he talked about Terry Moran is he is in a completely fucked up information bubble. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2061.0s)]
*  Like, he does not know what's in the Supreme Court case. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2068.0s)]
*  Like, maybe he has some sense it's not as clear cut as the Stephen Miller 9-0 thing, [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2070.0s)]
*  but he hasn't read it. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2075.0s)]
*  He doesn't know. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2076.0s)]
*  He's not reading anyone who's going to tell them what the real truth is. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2077.0s)]
*  Frankly, most people around him don't seem to be either. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2080.0s)]
*  And I think Trump 100% believes it. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2082.0s)]
*  And I think some of the people around him probably believe it. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2084.0s)]
*  I think Stephen Miller is like a pathological liar, pathological many things, you know, just a sociopath. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2086.0s)]
*  It's a pathogen. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2093.0s)]
*  But he is lying all the time about everything, knows he's lying, doesn't care, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2094.0s)]
*  and Trump trusts Stephen Miller, as he has said many times before and told interviewers and everything. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2100.0s)]
*  So I think that Stephen Miller is just feeding him a bunch of shit about immigration, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2106.0s)]
*  and he's just, you know, buying whatever Stephen Miller says because he knows that he doesn't really like immigrants [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2110.0s)]
*  and he wants to get a bunch of people out of the country. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2116.0s)]
*  And beyond that, he doesn't want to get into the details, you know? [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2119.0s)]
*  Yeah. His natural assumption is that Kilmar must be an MS-13. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2122.0s)]
*  Yes. Yes. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2127.0s)]
*  And so anything that validates that notion, he will automatically believe. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2128.0s)]
*  So the New York Times also reported this week that the White House has sent a diplomatic note to Bukele [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2132.0s)]
*  asking him to release Abrego Garcia, which the dictator apparently declined. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2138.0s)]
*  That, of course, contradicts what Trump told Terry Moran about how he could pick up the phone at any moment and get him back. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2143.0s)]
*  He just doesn't want to because he doesn't think he's a good man. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2149.0s)]
*  But then he also said he didn't because his lawyers said it wasn't a good idea. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2154.0s)]
*  How do you think all that's going to land with the nine justices on the Supreme Court when this inevitably comes back to them? [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2159.0s)]
*  I really can't believe that democracy is going to hand you on the interpretation of the word facilitate. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2164.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2169.0s)]
*  On the merits, this would be open and shut. They said you have to do it. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2170.0s)]
*  He said on national television that he could do it. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2174.0s)]
*  He said he has not done it. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2178.0s)]
*  And then they assumed just covered his ass by sending this fake note that Bukele knew to reject. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2180.0s)]
*  And I think the reason they did that is because if you look at the Supreme Court decision and they, you know, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2185.0s)]
*  They draw the distinction between facilitate and effectuate. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2190.0s)]
*  And you could see a situation where the government says, OK, we tried. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2193.0s)]
*  We asked to get him back. But then now the Bukele said, no, now this is squarely in the realm of foreign policy and diplomatic relations. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2198.0s)]
*  And the court can't tell the administration, the executive branch how to run their foreign policy. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2208.0s)]
*  We tried. Sorry. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2214.0s)]
*  That might have worked were it not for Trump sitting in the Oval Office telling the world through Terry Moran that actually I could do I could pick up the phone myself. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2216.0s)]
*  But I just I just don't want to. And also my lawyers don't want to. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2227.0s)]
*  It all comes down to the willingness of the court to force a confrontation with Trump. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2230.0s)]
*  Yeah, they wrote the decision to give some space to avoid a confrontation. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2235.0s)]
*  And Trump is now forcing it. And when they when push comes to shove, will they actually again demand he do it in stronger language? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2240.0s)]
*  Yeah. And you could say, look, he'll get I could see Thomas Alito and then who knows who else saying, oh, they did send the diplomatic note. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2248.0s)]
*  And that's they tried, you know, so that is they tried to do that. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2256.0s)]
*  But I don't I don't know if that's going to be enough for anyone, anyone who's a straight shooter. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2259.0s)]
*  I hate to tell you this, John. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2264.0s)]
*  Well, look, John Roberts is just calling balls and strikes. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2265.0s)]
*  A judge in Texas, another judge, multiple judges have ruled this now just ruled today as we're recording this on Thursday that Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to send people to El Salvador without due process is illegal. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2267.0s)]
*  That, no, you cannot just say that we are being invaded by a foreign government because you somehow make the connection that Trende Aragua is is is invading the country at the behest of the Venezuelan government. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2283.0s)]
*  There's just no evidence of that, including, by the way, the State Department says there's no evidence of Trump's own State Department. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2298.0s)]
*  And there's a cable that says that. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2304.0s)]
*  And so the judge ruled it's illegal. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2307.0s)]
*  And what's interesting about that is it is a Trump judge. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2309.0s)]
*  It is another another conservative Trump judges like no. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2312.0s)]
*  And that's actually a big deal because the Supreme Court has not touched this part of this yet, which is is the use of the alien is Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act constitutional in is it is it the appropriate place to use it? [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2317.0s)]
*  And that's going to end up at the Supreme Court, too. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2333.0s)]
*  And I think that's a tough I think that's a tough one to prove as well. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2336.0s)]
*  I'm not a constitutional scholar here, but of course it doesn't fucking allow it. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2339.0s)]
*  The whole point is you have to be invaded and you can't just make up fake invasions. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2344.0s)]
*  You cannot make up street gangs. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2348.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, how will the Supreme Court rule? [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2350.0s)]
*  Don't know. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2352.0s)]
*  But once again, on a pure common sense level, they should not be allowed to use this law to deport people without due process. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2353.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2359.0s)]
*  And at least we've started this case with at least one Trump judge said this is a no no. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2360.0s)]
*  So we'll see what the others say. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2365.0s)]
*  One bit of good news we wanted to touch on before moving on Columbia University activist Mohsen Madhawi, who was arrested in April at his naturalization interview, was released by a federal judge in Vermont on Wednesday, who likened his detention to the McCarthy era Red Scare. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2368.0s)]
*  Speaking outside the courthouse, Madhawi said, We have to mobilize, we have to organize, we have to invest in peace and center compassion and empathy. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2383.0s)]
*  And he told the Trump administration, I am not afraid of you. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2390.0s)]
*  What do you think? Do you have the sense that the tide may be turning on the on the student visa purge? [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2395.0s)]
*  Maybe it kind of feels like it. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2400.0s)]
*  The the the the administration has backed off on a lot of it. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2402.0s)]
*  There's been a lot of very good public demonstration against it and public pressure put in place. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2405.0s)]
*  And so we'll see. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2410.0s)]
*  Right. You never want to claim victory. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2412.0s)]
*  Yeah. Trump administration on an immigration issue. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2414.0s)]
*  But it seems like the momentum for what they were doing has stopped in the P. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2416.0s)]
*  And there were too few people when the first cases started happening, where people were afraid to speak up. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2420.0s)]
*  They were afraid. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2426.0s)]
*  And that seems to have changed in the fact that people have spoken up, both political leaders, university presidents, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2427.0s)]
*  you know, others in the community, protesters themselves, has changed the tide here. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2436.0s)]
*  I think that's a positive sign. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2441.0s)]
*  And Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, does have, unfortunately, a lot of leeway to terminate visas if he believes the visa holder, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2442.0s)]
*  the student represents a threat to our foreign policy or national security or would, you know, [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2451.0s)]
*  their existence in the country would mean adverse effects for our foreign policy, whatever the exact language is. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2458.0s)]
*  But you still have to like, you still have to prove that. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2465.0s)]
*  You know, you have to have some evidence for that. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2469.0s)]
*  And I don't think an op ed in the case, some cases or just showing up at a peaceful protest. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2471.0s)]
*  I don't know that that's that's going to be enough for the courts. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2478.0s)]
*  It shouldn't be. It shouldn't be. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2481.0s)]
*  It shouldn't be. It wasn't in this case, at least. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2483.0s)]
*  All right. Let's talk about how Democrats have been responding to Trump's 100 days week celebration with lots of posting, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2486.0s)]
*  protesting and speechifying, including a return to the spotlight for Kamala Harris, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2492.0s)]
*  who gave a big speech late Wednesday night in San Francisco, where she called Trump's tariffs, [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2497.0s)]
*  quote, the greatest manmade economic crisis in modern presidential history and warned of a constitutional crisis. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2501.0s)]
*  She also praised fellow Democrats for, quote, speaking with moral clarity about this moment. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2507.0s)]
*  What did you make of the speech? Why give it now? [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2513.0s)]
*  Why give it now is an interesting question because we are more than 100 days in. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2516.0s)]
*  This is really the first time anyone's heard her speak since her concession speech at Howard University. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2523.0s)]
*  Yeah, that is a sort of an unprecedented period of time for someone to stay silent, [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2527.0s)]
*  particularly someone who reportedly has political ambitions for something beyond this. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2534.0s)]
*  It's not just someone who lost and then that was the end of their career. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2538.0s)]
*  Yeah, she had some event that was like sort of little remarked on where she spoke a little bit about people finding courage. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2541.0s)]
*  And then she spoke out. She tore the fire damage in L.A. and said a few things there. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2550.0s)]
*  But that's really been it. This is like the first. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2554.0s)]
*  This is just for her first comment. And this was pitched as like you saw stories about this is pitch. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2556.0s)]
*  This is her first remarks. My takeaway here is that she is someone who is still processing the loss [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2562.0s)]
*  and in a bit of purgatory about her political future. Does she want to run for governor? [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2569.0s)]
*  Does she want to run for president or does she want to do neither and do something else with her life? [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2574.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, I think she's declared she wants to stay involved in some way, but that does not necessarily entail elective office. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2579.0s)]
*  And I think this speech looks one way. If she's decided to run for governor, I think it looks another way. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2584.0s)]
*  If she's definitely decided that she's most likely run for president and it looks a third way if she's decided something else. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2589.0s)]
*  And she clearly hasn't decided among those things. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2594.0s)]
*  The other thing I would just say is I'm not sure I would have picked a speech at a gala event that happened at 8 p.m. Pacific time as my big moment. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2596.0s)]
*  Like this was probably another way to do this. If she really wanted maybe she just agreed to this because it's an organization that has supported her and she supports. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2610.0s)]
*  And so she was going to make the best of it. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2617.0s)]
*  But then her people like just told all the reporters this was like a moment. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2619.0s)]
*  So like once they started reviewing it, it was more than just like, oh, I was going here anyway. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2624.0s)]
*  And so I was just speaking. I like if it had been me, I would have let the air. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2627.0s)]
*  I would have done something else earlier. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2630.0s)]
*  Doesn't have to be like I actually would have not done a speech as my first. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2632.0s)]
*  I would have found a place you know, you could be in conversation somewhere. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2635.0s)]
*  You could do a podcast, you know, like the one example I thought was she could go on the I've had it podcast, which is, you know, where she's she had been before. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2638.0s)]
*  She was vice president did a great job. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2646.0s)]
*  America, the doors open at any time, but just find a way to just have a like a more fulsome conversation about everything. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2649.0s)]
*  What happened? Why you lost? What do you think about happening without having to give? [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2656.0s)]
*  Because a speech just comes with expectations. What are you going to say that's new? [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2660.0s)]
*  Right. How are you going to like what is like what is your reaction all the world? [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2665.0s)]
*  There's I think there's that was probably a more formal, more modern communications way to do it. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2669.0s)]
*  But you know, it's fine. It was fun. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2674.0s)]
*  Like this is not the end all be all of the whole thing. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2676.0s)]
*  I think one other thing that just we don't think perhaps we don't think about because we're in it every day. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2678.0s)]
*  But when you look at the polls of who people think the leader of the Democratic Party is the plurality by far is Kamala Harris. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2683.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's like 2830 percent. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2688.0s)]
*  How much do you think that's a function of name ID and the fact that it's a wall? [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2691.0s)]
*  The other people who was on the ticket, you know, she issues. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2694.0s)]
*  She is. I don't think she is. It's not. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2697.0s)]
*  We have not given her the task of being leader of the nominee. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2699.0s)]
*  Of course. She hasn't asked for it. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2701.0s)]
*  But she is a big voice. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2703.0s)]
*  Like you look about people who could get attention in this moment to make a case against Trump. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2705.0s)]
*  She is on a short list of people who can do that. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2710.0s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2712.0s)]
*  And it seemed like she wanted to give the speech but not get a ton of attention given how she gave it and when she gave it. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2713.0s)]
*  So it feels between I guess it feels betwixt in between for me. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2718.0s)]
*  Yeah. To your point about it, it looks one way if she's running for president, another for governor, another for something else. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2721.0s)]
*  I think if she has or if she ultimately decides that she's not going to run for anything else and she's just going to, you know, speak out whenever she can and do whatever else. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2729.0s)]
*  I think it's like a perfectly fine speech. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2738.0s)]
*  I think if she's running for president or if she's running for governor of California, then, you know, she just she needs more. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2740.0s)]
*  We need to hear more from her because I think it was a lot of just sort of warmed over rhetoric that didn't she didn't really say anything new or interesting or particularly in the first place. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2748.0s)]
*  It's just so insightful that we haven't heard before. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2759.0s)]
*  And look, I don't think this is anything that a consultant or a speechwriter or anyone can give you. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2761.0s)]
*  I think like this needs to come from her. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2769.0s)]
*  I think if she wants to be she wants to run for president again, she wants to be governor. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2771.0s)]
*  Like she has to decide what she really believes, what she really cares about, offer some actual ideas. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2776.0s)]
*  She said at the end of the speech, like I'm not here to give you all the answers. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2783.0s)]
*  That's fine. It's a first speech. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2786.0s)]
*  But I just think that I just think we need more from her. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2787.0s)]
*  And look, I like I think she had an enormous enormously difficult job in the 100 days of this campaign. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2792.0s)]
*  I think she stepped up in a huge way. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2797.0s)]
*  She deserves all the praise in the world for that. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2798.0s)]
*  But, you know, she just you need more if you're going to at this point in the country, where the country is right now, Donald Trump, president, we're under threat. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2801.0s)]
*  And that constitutional crisis, all the stuff we've been talking about, like you got to have something to say about that that is different than just rhetoric. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2810.0s)]
*  You know, and that's mostly the speech was just rhetoric. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2819.0s)]
*  I think the place where I would offer some grace here is we've known people who've run for president lost, particularly if you're the nominee. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2821.0s)]
*  And it is a pretty earth shattering traumatic experience. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2830.0s)]
*  It takes a lot of Al Gore beard. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2833.0s)]
*  It really and she's in a particularly strange position where it's like one day she's vice president. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2836.0s)]
*  She's just going about her life. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2841.0s)]
*  Maybe maybe she's going to get reelected vice president or not. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2843.0s)]
*  But she has this future. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2846.0s)]
*  And then she gets she didn't run for president in 2024. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2847.0s)]
*  She got snatched out of her job, thrown into this thing with 106 days to go, gets his burst of momentum, outperforms all reasonable expectations for most of that campaign for someone who's put in that position and then loses to this horrendous, horrible person. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2850.0s)]
*  It's like it's clear she's still processing that. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2864.0s)]
*  And she found herself in such a way had to say something hasn't figured out what's next for her or like what the next step is. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2867.0s)]
*  And so it's just like everything you say about what she said is correct. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2874.0s)]
*  It's just she's in a difficult position. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2879.0s)]
*  I think it is worth it. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2881.0s)]
*  She is. She is. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2882.0s)]
*  But this this predates this speech and her difficult position. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2883.0s)]
*  It's like I just I I really want Kamala Harris to sit down and it's like no notes, no advisors. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2887.0s)]
*  What do you think's happening to the country right now? [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2895.0s)]
*  What is bothering you? [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2897.0s)]
*  What do you want to fix? [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2898.0s)]
*  And what do you really want to fight about? [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2899.0s)]
*  Just just tell us. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2901.0s)]
*  No notes. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2903.0s)]
*  You know, I think that would do her. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2905.0s)]
*  I mean, again, if she doesn't want to run again for anything, that's fine. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2907.0s)]
*  Then I have no criticism. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2910.0s)]
*  But if you want to like this is this is the big leagues, right? [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2912.0s)]
*  You want to be president of the United States or you want to be governor of the biggest state in the country. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2915.0s)]
*  Got to step up, you know. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2918.0s)]
*  So that is my that's my thought on that. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2920.0s)]
*  Another Democrat out there this week, perhaps inadvertently, was Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who spent Trump's 100th day with Trump in Michigan at an air base that he agreed to keep open and expand, which is something that Whitmer had been pushing for since Biden was president and had [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2923.0s)]
*  multiple calls and meetings with Trump about. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2938.0s)]
*  Trump thanked Whitmer at the event and then without warning asked her to say a few words, which she looked so psyched to do. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2940.0s)]
*  So Whitmer awkwardly thanked Trump without saying his name, shook his hand, walked away. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2947.0s)]
*  This was after an equally awkward embrace on the tarmac. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2952.0s)]
*  Half embrace. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2956.0s)]
*  He went in for the embrace. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2957.0s)]
*  She kind of had her hand on the shoulder. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2958.0s)]
*  It was very awkward. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2960.0s)]
*  And that came a few weeks after Whitmer's now famous Oval Office meeting with Trump, which unbeknownst to her, started as a press event where Trump announced criminal investigations into two former Trump administration officials, ultimately causing her to hide her face behind a folder, which was a picture that will live in infamy. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2962.0s)]
*  Just exactly how she planned it all, I'm sure. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2984.0s)]
*  It's on the whiteboard. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2988.0s)]
*  So I spoke to Governor Whitmer on Wednesday about all this. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2989.0s)]
*  You'll hear that conversation in a minute. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2992.0s)]
*  But wanted to ask you, what do you think of all of this? [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2994.0s)]
*  Her last few weeks, the event this week. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2997.0s)]
*  So let's stipulate that a lot of people have declared that her political career is functionally over because of the hug, the folder photo, all of that. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=2999.0s)]
*  That if she had any presidential ambitions, those are over. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3009.0s)]
*  I think that's premature. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3011.0s)]
*  People, there's a lot, plenty of time to bounce back from what has been an uncomfortable couple of weeks here. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3012.0s)]
*  Having said that, I think that there, some of these things definitely raise a question of political instincts. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3018.0s)]
*  Like, I still don't understand why she did not walk out of the Oval Office. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3025.0s)]
*  And the second you walk out of the West Wing of the White House, there are reporters arrayed there with microphones. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3029.0s)]
*  And you could just, you know, if you don't want to yell at the president on live national television in his office, I can buy that. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3034.0s)]
*  Other people may think maybe some people do that. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3040.0s)]
*  If you don't want to do that, that's fine. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3042.0s)]
*  But you can't go out and not say something to the press about what you just witnessed. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3043.0s)]
*  She told me that what reporters haven't been reporting is that she did leave. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3049.0s)]
*  Like after the picture and after she started close to him and then she sunk away. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3054.0s)]
*  And then she was, then she did the, then they did the folder and she then she left and she talked to her staff and she said, you know, I told them like, we must get it out there that I don't agree with it. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3058.0s)]
*  Which it still gets to your point where you're like, she could have told the cameras that, you know, right. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3069.0s)]
*  It's an opportunity. Like the way to think about it is it's both you know, you have a problem and you got to fix your problem right away. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3073.0s)]
*  And it may also be an opportunity if you handle it right. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3080.0s)]
*  Like that, I don't know why that instinct wasn't there, but I think there's something bigger than just what Whitmer, this is about bigger than Whitmer. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3083.0s)]
*  Like what I think we're seeing here is what I what I think is the real divide in Democratic Party now, which is not left, right. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3091.0s)]
*  It's those people who truly believe to their core that we are in an extraordinary dangerous moment in American history. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3098.0s)]
*  And our and want to respond as such. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3105.0s)]
*  Those are people like AOC and Bernie, Chris Murphy, Cory Booker, who sort of are trying to toss traditional ordinary politics aside and respond in a new way that is commiserate with the threat that Trump faces. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3108.0s)]
*  Then there's another group of people. There's no group of people who think Trump is not bad. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3122.0s)]
*  But the other group of people, which I think Whitmer falls into this and Schumer falls into it, is that Trump is bad and dangerous. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3125.0s)]
*  But we are not truly in a crisis that necessitates an extraordinary response and that ordinary politics can still work. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3133.0s)]
*  That it is OK to believe that the traditional rules of how shutdowns work out politically is the same way. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3143.0s)]
*  And then in Whitmer's case, it is you're still in a moment where the right thing to the good politics is to bring the bacon home for your state. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3152.0s)]
*  Now, she is right that this is an important thing and she's been working on a long time. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3161.0s)]
*  You do want to help your state. And I am sympathetic to Gavin Newsom when he had to be kind of play nice to ensure that California didn't lose out on aid after the wildfires. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3164.0s)]
*  But if you truly believe that Trump is something dangerous, you don't get on stage with him. You don't vote for his budget. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3174.0s)]
*  You don't put yourself in a position where he can hug you. Right. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3182.0s)]
*  And you're willing to take in your you like there is your state could pay a price for it. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3185.0s)]
*  But you're going to fight back on all the other terrible things that Trump is doing to your state. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3191.0s)]
*  You're not just focusing on this one particular project, which comes at the expense of all those other things. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3196.0s)]
*  Here's what's wild about the Whitmer thing is the the the two different factions you laid out. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3201.0s)]
*  Like, I totally agree with that. But when you listen to this interview, she basically picked both. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3208.0s)]
*  And that was what's wild to me. Like, I thought that when I asked her, are we in a constitutional crisis? [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3215.0s)]
*  You know, is this is he really a threat? All this kind of stuff that she would try to make an argument that normal politics works. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3221.0s)]
*  And I'm not going to get into that. And I'm thinking about my state and all that kind of stuff, which is again, I don't I don't agree with that. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3230.0s)]
*  But it is a cohesive argument. It was it's very weird to me that she at one point was like, yeah, yes, we're in a constitutional crisis. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3236.0s)]
*  Yes, people should be scared. I read her J.B. Pritzker's quote from one of his speech where he called for mass protests and resistance in the streets. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3243.0s)]
*  And she said, I agree with that. And I agree with what AOC and Bernie are doing. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3251.0s)]
*  And then she was like, but I'm mad that pundits, you know, don't they think they know what's going on in the ground in Michigan and what Michigan people care about? [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3256.0s)]
*  And it's like, you got to you got to pick something. You got to pick a lane. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3264.0s)]
*  And like, again, I don't I don't really I didn't with her want to focus on the folder or being at the event or the hug or anything like that, because it's like, you know, even being civil to Trump. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3267.0s)]
*  A lot of this is optics. And I get it. I get the odd position. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3277.0s)]
*  And like, I totally understand if you are governor, you want to help your state and you want to you need to work with this guy and talk with this guy about some stuff to help your state. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3280.0s)]
*  I get that. And other people were like, you don't understand. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3288.0s)]
*  She needs to help help jobs in Michigan. And people in Michigan love her for this. And that's great. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3291.0s)]
*  Like, you know, I get that. That's fine. You can still do that while also speaking out about the threat of Donald Trump, which she used to do all the time back in 2020. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3295.0s)]
*  When she was dealing with him and covid, she was dealing with him over in the pandemic and criticizing him pretty intensely. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3307.0s)]
*  So something has changed. She's either gotten some advice from people that I don't think is good advice or not. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3313.0s)]
*  But like, I don't I just don't understand why you can't really say it's a constitutional crisis that we're in a constitutional crisis and then also say like, but yeah, I just needed to talk to him and hang out with him and not bring up all these issues.

*  You've been fighting to get that done for a long time. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3565.38s)]

*  Well, you know, I'll just start with this. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3584.06s)]
*  Selfridge is a really important linchpin [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3586.1s)]
*  in Michigan's bases. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3588.82s)]
*  We've got four, Selfridge is the place [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3591.14s)]
*  where we have our fighter mission. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3593.5s)]
*  The A-10s have been scheduled to be retired. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3594.66s)]
*  And so I have spent every year since I've been governor [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3596.9s)]
*  trying to get recapitalized a fighter mission. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3600.06s)]
*  You know, through the four years, you know, [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3603.18s)]
*  to be candid under the Biden administration, [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3604.82s)]
*  I was trying to get this done. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3607.1s)]
*  We did get tankers, which is great, [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3608.52s)]
*  but it's not a fighter mission. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3610.2999999999997s)]
*  So soon as I had the opportunity [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3611.54s)]
*  for the first conversation [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3614.8s)]
*  at the National Governors Association dinner, [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3616.1200000000003s)]
*  I took the chance to say this is important. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3618.32s)]
*  And ever since then, I've had a number of meetings [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3620.7200000000003s)]
*  and phone calls just to try to get this over the finish line. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3623.6400000000003s)]
*  And I'm grateful that they were interested. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3626.36s)]
*  I know they care about Michigan. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3628.8s)]
*  I think defense is a place where they see a need. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3630.28s)]
*  And it took a lot of work to get there, [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3633.7200000000003s)]
*  but you know, it's the right thing for Michigan. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3636.8s)]
*  There's no question that recapitalizing this, [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3639.7200000000003s)]
*  it's got $850 million impact on the state of Michigan. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3642.38s)]
*  30,000 jobs are connected to Selfridge. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3646.9s)]
*  And so this is a BFD. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3649.58s)]
*  And I'm glad that we got over the finish line. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3652.02s)]
*  It doesn't mean I've abandoned any of my values. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3654.46s)]
*  It doesn't mean that I'm not gonna stand my ground [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3656.9s)]
*  and fight where we have to, [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3659.5s)]
*  but this is one of those moments where as a public servant, [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3660.86s)]
*  you're reminded your job is to put service above self [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3664.86s)]
*  and that's what it was all about. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3668.42s)]
*  So you do this event with the president, [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3670.2s)]
*  then he does a political event in Michigan, [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3672.16s)]
*  which you didn't attend, [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3674.08s)]

*  trying to take away the power of our president. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3678.12s)]
*  Then he does an interview after with ABC, [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3680.72s)]
*  where he says he could facilitate the release [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3682.8399999999997s)]

*  Is the president not in open defiance [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3693.8799999999997s)]
*  of the Supreme Court at this point? [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3697.06s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's unconscionable. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3699.12s)]
*  So many of the actions that they've taken in a hundred days, [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3701.12s)]
*  the amount of damage that has been done. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3703.3599999999997s)]
*  You know, I continue to stay grounded [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3705.44s)]
*  in talking to Michiganders and I can tell you [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3707.72s)]
*  that the tariffs are taking a toll, [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3709.3399999999997s)]
*  job losses, concerns about being able to afford an F-150. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3711.7999999999997s)]
*  You know, when I was at the White House [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3716.7999999999997s)]
*  in that folder in that infamous picture, [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3718.96s)]
*  inside that were real stories for Michiganders [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3721.7599999999998s)]
*  about how hard the tariffs have already been [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3724.54s)]
*  on their families, on their businesses, [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3726.7999999999997s)]
*  on small businesses alike. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3729.8s)]
*  And that's who I'm fighting for. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3730.52s)]
*  And so to see that, to hear that, [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3733.6s)]
*  you could see why, you know, there's no way on earth [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3737.48s)]
*  I was doing anything beyond that press conference yesterday [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3740.56s)]
*  because I think so much of what they're doing [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3744.2s)]
*  is damaging not just here and now, [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3746.08s)]
*  but they're gonna have long-term consequences [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3748.56s)]
*  in this country. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3750.88s)]
*  And that's precisely why I think it's important [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3751.7200000000003s)]
*  that we are showing up, we are locking arms, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3753.5s)]
*  and we are the party that is fighting [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3756.44s)]
*  for the average hard work in person in this country. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3758.2400000000002s)]
*  I do wanna get to the tariffs, but before we do, [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3761.48s)]
*  do you think we're in a constitutional crisis? [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3765.48s)]
*  If the Supreme Court has told the president to do something, [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3768.42s)]
*  he has decided not to do it. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3771.6000000000004s)]
*  I think this is the second time he's done this. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3774.7200000000003s)]
*  He's also not enforcing the TikTok ban, [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3777.7200000000003s)]
*  just sort of ignoring that [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3779.8s)]
*  or ignoring the court's order on that. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3780.96s)]
*  Are we in a constitutional crisis? [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3783.28s)]
*  And what's the responsibility of other leaders [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3785.0s)]
*  in the country if we are? [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3789.1200000000003s)]
*  We are, and I think that no one is above the law. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3791.2400000000002s)]
*  The thought that we've got an administration [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3795.96s)]
*  that is just blatantly violating court orders [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3799.6800000000003s)]
*  should, I think, scare everybody. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3804.0400000000004s)]
*  This is a very serious moment. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3807.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, at the end of the day, [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3810.5600000000004s)]
*  I hope that we finally see some backbone [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3812.0800000000004s)]
*  out of some of the Republicans in Congress, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3814.16s)]
*  you know, to stand up to the courts [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3817.04s)]
*  to enforce their orders. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3820.3999999999996s)]
*  I mean, there are a lot of people [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3822.3199999999997s)]
*  that aren't doing their jobs [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3823.8399999999997s)]
*  to protect the foundations of this country, [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3825.04s)]
*  and many of us are fighting the fights that we can, [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3827.06s)]
*  but ultimately, the courts have gotta be able [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3830.72s)]
*  to have the last word, and this undermines, [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3833.5s)]
*  I think, the foundations of our country [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3836.6s)]
*  on every level when this happens. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3838.3199999999997s)]
*  The president went on to say in that interview [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3840.44s)]
*  that he's justified in ordering criminal investigations [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3843.28s)]
*  into people he thinks are dishonest. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3847.0s)]
*  You were obviously unwittingly brought into the Oval [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3849.96s)]
*  for the Press event where Trump ordered an investigation [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3852.92s)]
*  into one of his first-term administration officials [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3856.32s)]
*  because he said the 2020 election wasn't fraudulent. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3858.96s)]
*  State election officials responded to that, [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3863.36s)]
*  saying they are outraged and alarmed. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3865.22s)]
*  This was a cybersecurity election official. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3867.2s)]
*  What was your reaction when you saw him do that [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3869.96s)]
*  when you were in the Oval? [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3871.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, as Lovett said, [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3873.6s)]
*  there are no corners in the Oval Office, right? [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3875.7599999999998s)]
*  I was brought in for what I thought [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3878.3999999999996s)]
*  was gonna be a one-on-one meeting. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3880.52s)]
*  It became very clear as soon as I walked in the room [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3882.7999999999997s)]
*  that that was not the case. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3885.08s)]
*  I grabbed one of his staff people. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3886.08s)]
*  I said, what is happening here? [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3887.3599999999997s)]
*  And he said, he's just gonna sign executive order, [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3888.7799999999997s)]
*  and then you're gonna have your meeting. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3890.8799999999997s)]
*  And then all of that transpired, [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3892.3999999999996s)]
*  and I gravitated from the front of the room [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3894.68s)]
*  to the back of the room, [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3897.2s)]
*  and that's when that picture was taken. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3898.64s)]
*  But I also left the room. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3900.72s)]
*  No one reported that. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3902.3599999999997s)]
*  I left the room to go talk to my staff person [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3903.3999999999996s)]
*  and said, we gotta word out [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3905.48s)]
*  because the stuff that's going on in there, [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3907.7999999999997s)]
*  I want to be, I cannot be associated with that. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3909.66s)]
*  I do not endorse that. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3912.4399999999996s)]
*  I'm not here for that. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3913.72s)]
*  But I had to stay and have my meeting after that was done. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3916.16s)]
*  So, it is not easy to navigate these times. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3919.0s)]
*  But one of the things that I've learned [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3923.56s)]
*  is I've gotta put the people of Michigan first [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3925.7s)]
*  over my self-interest, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3928.64s)]
*  over maybe what people assume [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3930.4s)]
*  are gonna be my political interests. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3931.7999999999997s)]
*  The people of Michigan come first. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3933.72s)]
*  I took an oath to them. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3934.96s)]
*  When I was in the Senate, [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3936.7999999999997s)]
*  we were in the minority. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3939.16s)]
*  I was the Senate minority leader, [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3940.24s)]
*  and we had Republican control [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3941.96s)]
*  of both chambers of the legislature [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3943.6s)]
*  and in the governor's office. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3945.2s)]
*  We got our teeth kicked in every day. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3946.96s)]
*  Of course, I had colleagues who, [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3949.04s)]
*  when they finally wanted to do Medicaid expansion, [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3950.8799999999997s)]
*  a Republican governor wanted to expand Medicaid [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3953.44s)]
*  under the Affordable Care Act to Michiganders. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3956.44s)]
*  Some of my Democratic colleagues said, [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3958.68s)]
*  hell no, let's not do it. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3960.2000000000003s)]
*  Let's make him beg for it. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3961.96s)]
*  Let's deliver him a loss, [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3963.52s)]
*  and then they'll have to come back. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3965.88s)]
*  And I didn't want to take that risk [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3967.6s)]
*  because I knew hundreds of thousands of Michiganders [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3969.12s)]
*  might get their healthcare from this. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3971.52s)]
*  And so, I went to work [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3973.2000000000003s)]
*  to bring my Democratic colleagues along. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3975.06s)]
*  It wasn't easy, but at the end of the day, [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3977.56s)]
*  that's the job. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3980.4s)]
*  That is the job that I have. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3981.76s)]
*  And if we Democrats want to be successful [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3983.18s)]
*  in future elections, we can't forget that. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3986.5s)]
*  We got to give each other the grace [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3989.18s)]
*  to fight on the battlefield and lock arms, [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3991.22s)]
*  because these are high stakes moments in this country [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3995.1s)]
*  as we think about all the stuff that's just happened [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=3998.2s)]
*  in merely 100 days. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4000.52s)]
*  Trump is currently investigating Michigan colleges [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4002.48s)]
*  and universities for their diversity policies. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4005.3799999999997s)]
*  He's already tried to kick dozens [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4008.06s)]
*  of Michigan foreign students out of the country. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4009.54s)]
*  He's threatening to unlawfully freeze federal funding [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4011.94s)]
*  for Michigan public schools, as he's already doing in Maine, [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4014.26s)]
*  because Governor Mills spoke up in a meeting. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4017.38s)]
*  Have you asked the president to stop targeting people [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4021.42s)]
*  and institutions in your state? [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4024.7000000000003s)]
*  You know, I have talked to the president about tariffs, [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4026.58s)]
*  which obviously we don't agree on. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4029.58s)]
*  I have talked to the president about Asian carp [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4031.14s)]
*  that pose a real threat to the Great Lakes. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4033.26s)]
*  I have talked to the president about ice storm victims [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4035.42s)]
*  in Northern Michigan, who I'm hoping we can get some help [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4037.86s)]
*  from FEMA to support. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4040.74s)]
*  I have not had that direct conversation on this subject yet, [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4042.4199999999996s)]
*  but I'm not afraid to do that. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4045.58s)]
*  Yeah, I guess what I'm, where I am on this is, [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4047.54s)]
*  like, I totally understand the need to work with [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4050.4199999999996s)]
*  even this president, because whether we like it or not, [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4052.4399999999996s)]
*  he has a lot of power to help or hurt people that, [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4056.14s)]
*  in your case, that you represent. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4059.58s)]
*  But he's also abusing that power right now [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4061.74s)]
*  to hurt people that you represent. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4064.4199999999996s)]
*  And so I wonder if you, you know, [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4067.0s)]
*  isn't it worth speaking up for the rights [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4070.2400000000002s)]
*  and the freedoms of those people [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4072.6s)]
*  when you're at an event with them [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4075.16s)]
*  or when you're in a meeting with them? [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4076.54s)]
*  Yeah, whenever I get the opportunity, [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4078.08s)]
*  I use every minute of that to cover a lot of different issues. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4079.92s)]
*  So this is, I think, a very important one [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4084.36s)]
*  that you're raising, there's no question. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4086.78s)]
*  And I will continue whenever I have opportunities [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4088.26s)]
*  to make sure that I'm covering as much as I can, no question. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4091.44s)]
*  On tariffs, the president offered some relief [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4095.22s)]
*  to automakers last night. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4098.219999999999s)]
*  He announced the headline in the Detroit Free Press [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4099.5s)]
*  is Trump scales back tariffs on automakers, [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4102.219999999999s)]
*  but analysts still expect car prices to rise. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4104.5599999999995s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4107.54s)]
*  And did you get a chance to raise tariffs with him on Tuesday? [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4108.62s)]
*  Or, and what is his, what have those conversations [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4112.82s)]
*  been like about tariffs with him? [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4115.7s)]
*  I did not get much of a chance to talk about it on Tuesday, [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4116.98s)]
*  but I did say that the big three and the auto industry [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4119.5s)]
*  is hurting in Michigan because of the uncertainty [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4123.7s)]
*  around tariffs. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4125.74s)]
*  Certainly this newest policy might be somewhat helpful [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4127.26s)]
*  on paper, but let's be clear. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4131.62s)]
*  The uncertainty that has been created by variety [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4133.5199999999995s)]
*  of policies without a stated goal [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4136.94s)]
*  and an obvious solution here is what is creating paralysis, [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4139.22s)]
*  what is creating animosity with our Northern neighbors. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4143.38s)]
*  Canada, who is intertwined with the Michigan economy [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4147.78s)]
*  is all across the country, that's true, [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4151.42s)]
*  but especially in Michigan and Mexico, [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4153.24s)]
*  treating our allies like adversaries, [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4156.0s)]
*  I mean, there's a big cost to all of this [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4158.599999999999s)]
*  and it is gonna be borne by the American consumer. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4161.32s)]
*  It is gonna be borne by the person who gets laid off [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4164.36s)]
*  because their company doesn't make the investment [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4166.98s)]
*  that they had planned to. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4169.5199999999995s)]
*  It's gonna be borne by small businesses. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4171.0s)]
*  They can't stock up store rooms, [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4172.84s)]
*  like some businesses have been able to in preparation [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4175.679999999999s)]
*  for all these ups and downs. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4178.32s)]
*  This chaos with this tariff policy [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4180.08s)]
*  has undermined the American economy [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4182.6s)]
*  and has taken money out of people's pockets [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4185.08s)]
*  and that's the worst part of it. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4187.36s)]
*  So a couple of tweaks every few days [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4189.24s)]
*  doesn't fix the problem. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4192.68s)]
*  It actually perpetuates the pain. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4194.12s)]
*  In your conversations with him, [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4198.12s)]
*  do you get the sense that he's persuadable on this issue? [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4199.32s)]
*  No, I'm sorry to say that. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4202.08s)]
*  I mean, I, you know, I'll just be blunt. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4204.64s)]
*  I can tell you that I know that the auto companies [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4207.9400000000005s)]
*  are talking with the White House. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4211.5s)]
*  Again, I'm talking with them too. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4213.42s)]
*  I know that they are talking with [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4216.02s)]
*  the secretary, Lutnick and Commerce. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4217.74s)]
*  Obviously they've had some impact [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4220.9400000000005s)]
*  and that they've reevaluated some things, [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4222.96s)]
*  but I do believe that there is a core belief [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4225.12s)]
*  that messing with tariff policy [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4229.62s)]
*  is gonna be good for America, [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4232.52s)]
*  but it's not based on any, I think, [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4235.22s)]
*  economic prowess or strategy. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4237.54s)]
*  And I think that's the biggest concern is that [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4240.54s)]
*  if there was a goal, if there was a new rule [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4244.14s)]
*  that was going to last, [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4246.16s)]
*  American business might be able to figure a way [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4248.46s)]
*  to work with it, but the chaos [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4250.6s)]
*  is the biggest problem at the moment. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4252.740000000001s)]
*  I remember when the fires hit Los Angeles, [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4255.4400000000005s)]
*  I interviewed Governor Newsom shortly after [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4259.46s)]
*  and, you know, he was dealing with [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4262.18s)]
*  somewhat similar to what you were dealing with [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4264.38s)]
*  with Selfridge, which is, you know, [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4266.1s)]
*  he was trying not to criticize Trump too much [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4269.02s)]
*  because we needed to get federal funding [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4270.78s)]
*  for disaster relief for California. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4274.02s)]
*  And I asked him in the interview, I said, [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4276.7s)]
*  are you scared that if you criticize him too much [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4278.06s)]
*  or piss him off, then he's gonna yank federal funding [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4282.92s)]
*  and not give us the disaster relief aid that we need? [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4287.1s)]
*  Do you worry in the next couple years [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4290.9400000000005s)]
*  that if you criticize Donald Trump too much, [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4294.860000000001s)]
*  that he might change his mind on Selfridge? [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4296.5s)]
*  No, I mean, I don't. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4299.08s)]
*  They've made a commitment. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4301.18s)]
*  This is, you know, there are Republicans and Democrats [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4303.34s)]
*  that have been working hard to get this done. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4305.740000000001s)]
*  They got it done. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4308.34s)]
*  He got a great, you know, headlines here in Michigan. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4309.18s)]
*  I mean, people are thrilled with this. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4312.820000000001s)]
*  So, no, you know, my job is to fight for Michiganders. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4314.58s)]
*  And that means, you know, John, [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4318.58s)]
*  it means making tough decisions in a pandemic [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4320.54s)]
*  that ultimately people threaten to kill me. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4322.54s)]
*  I'm still gonna put Michiganders first. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4325.0199999999995s)]
*  It means showing up at the Oval Office [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4326.74s)]
*  and maybe having people, you know, pundits take shots at me [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4329.14s)]
*  for being there, but that's putting the people [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4333.42s)]
*  of Michigan first. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4336.22s)]
*  I can tell you right now that the people in Macomb County [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4337.3s)]
*  are often the ones that get polled [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4340.1s)]
*  whenever there's a presidential election. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4342.46s)]
*  They're the, you know, the bellwether [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4344.18s)]
*  in a bellwether state. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4346.74s)]
*  They don't care, you know, whether or not [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4349.14s)]
*  I held a folder in a picture. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4352.34s)]
*  They don't care. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4354.62s)]
*  They care if they're gonna have a job. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4355.58s)]
*  They care that their governor's fighting for them. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4357.5s)]
*  And I think that's the really interesting difference here [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4360.1s)]
*  is the media in Michigan has been, [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4365.900000000001s)]
*  it's all been positive, the reactions, [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4369.26s)]
*  not the media reactions, but the coverage, the people, [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4371.700000000001s)]
*  the reaction of the real people on the ground. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4374.700000000001s)]
*  And it's one of the things that real frustrate me [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4376.98s)]
*  about sometimes the national pundits [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4380.5s)]
*  is they tell Michiganders what they're thinking [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4382.62s)]
*  without actually talking to Michiganders. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4384.62s)]
*  And I think that's something that we have to educate people [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4387.339999999999s)]
*  on because man, if you're ever gonna be able to fight for [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4390.78s)]
*  and earn the respect of people on the ground, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4395.379999999999s)]
*  you gotta be there with them. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4397.419999999999s)]
*  And that's what it's all about. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4398.98s)]
*  Your neighboring governor, JB Pritzker, [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4400.9s)]
*  in Illinois gave a speech this week [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4403.82s)]
*  where he called for mass protests, [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4405.58s)]
*  mobilization and disruption. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4407.86s)]
*  He said, quote, these Republicans cannot know [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4409.66s)]
*  a moment of peace. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4411.66s)]
*  They have to understand that we will fight their cruelty [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4412.82s)]
*  with every megaphone and microphone that we have. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4414.98s)]
*  Do you agree with all that? [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4417.9s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4419.38s)]
*  I mean, I think I'm glad I told JB, [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4420.42s)]
*  I don't know, a couple of months ago, [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4422.94s)]
*  I'm glad he's out there. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4423.9s)]
*  I'm glad he's fighting. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4425.139999999999s)]
*  You know what? [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4426.54s)]
*  I'm really glad that AOC and Bernie are out there fighting. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4427.38s)]
*  I think it's gonna be important. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4430.58s)]
*  We gotta be Avenger style. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4432.38s)]
*  Every one of our voices matters. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4434.900000000001s)]
*  We have to work together. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4437.5s)]
*  And ultimately, we're gonna have to bring [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4438.78s)]
*  all these different groups of people that we're talking to [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4440.54s)]
*  that we represent together as well. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4443.74s)]
*  So I don't fault anyone outside of Michigan [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4445.58s)]
*  for not understanding what's going on the ground. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4448.74s)]
*  I just take umbrage with anyone who assumes [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4452.22s)]
*  they know what's going on the ground [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4455.46s)]
*  without actually asking [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4456.78s)]
*  because the real story is what's going on [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4458.62s)]
*  in real people's lives. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4460.78s)]
*  And obviously people in Michigan, [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4462.34s)]
*  just like elsewhere in America, [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4463.740000000001s)]
*  are very concerned about more than anything else, [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4465.820000000001s)]
*  cost of living issues and the effects of this trade war. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4468.3s)]
*  Do you think people in Michigan are also afraid [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4471.620000000001s)]
*  of this president and wonder [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4474.860000000001s)]
*  if he poses a threat to democracy, [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4477.900000000001s)]
*  if we're gonna have other elections? [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4480.18s)]
*  Yeah, I do think that that's a concern for a lot of people. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4482.5s)]
*  If you're not worried about putting food on the table, yes. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4486.06s)]
*  But if you're worried about putting food on the table [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4490.18s)]
*  or paying your electric bill, [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4492.26s)]
*  it's hard to think about anything else. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4494.46s)]
*  And that's one of the things that, you know, [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4496.14s)]
*  as I campaigned for Kamala Harris and Joe Biden before [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4497.900000000001s)]
*  and Barack Obama before, [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4502.740000000001s)]
*  I can tell you that, and Hillary Clinton, [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4505.58s)]
*  I can't skip Hillary Clinton, of course, [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4507.860000000001s)]
*  we know that the personal economy is always going to be [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4510.780000000001s)]
*  front and center for people. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4515.54s)]
*  And that's why we gotta stay focused [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4516.54s)]
*  on how are Democrats making people's lives better. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4518.34s)]
*  That's what I've done in Michigan. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4521.54s)]
*  I think that's why I've been able to carry [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4523.06s)]
*  this really swing state by double digits in two elections. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4524.900000000001s)]
*  We can't lose sight of that. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4529.42s)]
*  Last question, in your role as governor, [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4531.14s)]
*  are there other issues where you are looking [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4533.66s)]
*  to make progress by working with President Trump? [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4537.3s)]
*  And are there other fights you can see yourself having [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4541.5s)]
*  with the administration? [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4545.54s)]
*  Oh yeah, we're gonna fight like hell to protect people. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4547.1s)]
*  You know, the Medicaid cuts could be devastating [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4549.900000000001s)]
*  if they go through. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4552.660000000001s)]
*  And we are working really hard. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4553.58s)]
*  We've got a bipartisan group of Congress people [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4555.38s)]
*  that we are putting pressure on. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4558.660000000001s)]
*  40% of the Michigan budget is federal. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4560.860000000001s)]
*  Rural hospitals will close if those Medicaid cuts [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4563.34s)]
*  go through to pay for that tax break [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4566.5s)]
*  that no one's calling for. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4569.26s)]
*  So yeah, we're gonna fight on all these battlegrounds. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4570.860000000001s)]
*  I'll also say, I'm gonna continue to try to get help [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4574.780000000001s)]
*  to protect the Great Lakes from Asian carp. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4577.9400000000005s)]
*  I am going to try to get that FEMA declaration [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4579.860000000001s)]
*  for people in Northern Michigan who were devastated [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4582.38s)]
*  by the ice storm last month, [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4585.26s)]
*  some of whom still don't have power a month later. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4587.06s)]
*  So I've got big things that I still wanna try [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4589.780000000001s)]
*  to get done with the feds, [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4593.14s)]
*  but we're gonna fight to protect Michiganers, [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4594.26s)]
*  fight to protect fundamental rights and the rule of law too. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4597.38s)]
*  Governor Whitmer, thank you so much as always [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4600.5s)]
*  for giving us your time and coming on Pod Save America. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4602.780000000001s)]
*  Thanks, John, good to be with you. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4605.98s)]
*  One last moment from this week that we wanted to cover. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4607.62s)]
*  On Wednesday night, News Nation held a virtual town hall [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4610.0599999999995s)]
*  with Trump, who called in, moderated by Chris Cuomo, [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4614.379999999999s)]
*  Bill O'Reilly, and Stephen A. Smith, [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4619.379999999999s)]
*  featuring Steve Bannon, James Carville, RFK Jr. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4622.78s)]
*  Talk about a dream blunt rotation, huh? [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4628.62s)]
*  Uh, we learned about this like hours before it happened. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4631.66s)]
*  I thought it was a prank when I first saw it. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4637.139999999999s)]
*  I was like, that's not, this is not a cast of people [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4638.74s)]
*  who are actually gonna be together. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4640.9s)]
*  You sent me a message that said, [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4642.38s)]
*  here comes our A block for the show on Thursday, [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4644.46s)]
*  and I clicked on it hours later. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4647.7s)]
*  So I clicked on it being taken directly into the town hall. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4649.259999999999s)]
*  I knew there was a News Nation town hall. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4652.44s)]
*  Chris Cuomo, he was calling in. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4653.86s)]
*  You must have been like, what is going on? [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4654.7s)]
*  And when I turned on, there was just Stephen A. Smith [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4655.66s)]
*  and Bill O'Reilly, I mean, and Trump also, [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4658.34s)]
*  he called in, which is bananas. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4661.1s)]
*  Bananas, bananas. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4662.62s)]
*  So Stephen A. asked him about his fight with Harvard, [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4664.42s)]
*  and here's what happened. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4668.06s)]
*  Because when people think about Harvard, [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4669.18s)]
*  what they're basically talking about is they're asking, [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4671.38s)]
*  what do you say to those who view your actions [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4674.34s)]
*  as an attack on academic freedom [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4676.22s)]
*  rather than a defense of fairness? [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4679.02s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4681.5s)]
*  Well, I say this. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4683.26s)]
*  We had riots in Harlem, and frankly, [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4684.62s)]
*  if you look at what's gone on, [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4689.38s)]
*  and people from Harlem went up and they protested, Stephen, [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4690.82s)]
*  and they protested very strongly against Harvard. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4694.26s)]
*  They happened to be on my side. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4697.34s)]
*  You know, I got a very high black vote. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4698.74s)]
*  You know that. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4702.0199999999995s)]
*  Very, very high black vote. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4702.98s)]
*  It was a very great compliment to me. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4704.62s)]
*  I did criminal justice reform. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4707.0599999999995s)]
*  They agree with what I'm doing with respect to Harvard. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4709.22s)]
*  Very, lots to unpack there, Dan. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4715.1s)]
*  Lots to unpack. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4718.62s)]
*  First of all, does he start things off [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4719.58s)]
*  by confusing Columbia and Harvard [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4721.94s)]
*  because he was saying there's the riots in Harlem? [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4725.1s)]
*  Yeah, it seems that way. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4728.38s)]
*  So that's number one, right? [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4730.26s)]
*  I think, unless he thought he said [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4731.7s)]
*  Harlem instead of Harvard, but I think he got Harvard. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4733.46s)]
*  He got to Harvard. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4736.14s)]
*  He got to Harvard. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4736.98s)]
*  Also, in all of the times that Trump has talked about [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4738.0199999999995s)]
*  the press at Columbia University, [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4740.26s)]
*  he has never referred to it as the riots in Harlem [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4741.3s)]
*  until a black person asked him about it. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4743.98s)]
*  Yep, yep. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4745.459999999999s)]
*  And then, why did he mention the black vote? [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4746.62s)]
*  Why did he mention the black vote out of nowhere [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4751.299999999999s)]
*  to Stephen A. Smith, the black person who asked him? [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4753.5s)]
*  It's truly Pavlovian racism. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4756.66s)]
*  He just sees a black person ask a question [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4759.259999999999s)]
*  and he cannot fathom in his lizard brain [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4762.419999999999s)]
*  that a black person can ask him about a question [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4765.62s)]
*  that is not specific and inherently and entirely about [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4768.139999999999s)]
*  something involving the black community. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4771.419999999999s)]
*  It's why he talked about criminal justice reform. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4774.94s)]
*  I mean, it's been, he uses the term they in there [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4776.78s)]
*  like five times. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4779.98s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4780.82s)]
*  The cherry on the sundae is the very end where he said [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4781.66s)]
*  they like what I'm doing at Harvard. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4785.139999999999s)]
*  The black people? [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4786.98s)]
*  The black people of America like that I'm investigating [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4788.62s)]
*  Harvard over anti-Semitism. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4792.179999999999s)]
*  Which was not your question, Stephen, [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4794.78s)]
*  but you are black, so I thought you might be curious [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4796.099999999999s)]
*  to know that. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4797.86s)]
*  And by the way, Stephen, you may be asking me [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4798.7s)]
*  a difficult question that's a little challenging, [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4801.5s)]
*  but I do want you to know that other black people, [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4804.9s)]
*  they voted for me. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4807.86s)]
*  That's what I got from it. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4809.179999999999s)]
*  I don't know how else to take it. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4812.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4813.54s)]
*  Things are going great. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4814.379999999999s)]

*  That's our president. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4818.179999999999s)]
*  America saw four years of that and they were like, [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4819.0199999999995s)]
*  let's give us four more. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdDmvM7mxU&t=4820.58s)]
