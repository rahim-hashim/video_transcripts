Video Description: Donald Trump turns his attention westward, announcing new tariffs on any and all movies "produced in foreign lands" and pledging to reopen Alcatraz. In a long Meet the Press interview, the president admits that a recession would be "okay," defers to his lawyers when asked about his duty to uphold the Constitution, and doubles down on his message that American children have been spoiled with too many dolls, pencils, and strollers. Jon, Lovett, and Tommy discuss the absurdity of tariffing foreign films, how Trump's toy gambit has cost him the support of Karl Rove, and deliver another Corrupdate on Trump's memecoin scam. Then, Tommy talks to Chasten Buttigieg about his new children's book, Papa's Coming Home, and his husband Pete's journey to do battle in the manosphere. You can get Chasten's book here: https://www.papas-coming-home.com/

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

*  Unbelievable. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=50.08s)]

*  That night I read it to Charlie. I told Chastain this but Charlie loved the book. Like multiple lols from my. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=89.11999999999999s)]

*  I'm excited. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=103.36s)]
*  All right, let's get to the news. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=106.56s)]
*  And we'll start with the economy where Donald Trump is doubling down on his message that Americans just need to suck it up and [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=108.0s)]
*  sacrifice for the sake of his majesty's trade war. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=113.18s)]
*  Especially our kids who've uh, frankly been spoiled with too many dolls, pencils, and strollers. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=116.56s)]
*  He's got a point. Uh, the president sat down for a [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=121.92s)]
*  pencils. Who's the, where's the pencils? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=125.02s)]
*  Where'd the fucking pencils come from? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=128.0s)]
*  You think you think he spent a lot of time down on the floor playing with the kids? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=130.24s)]
*  He doesn't know what the toys are. He thinks we still have the sharpeners that you're that you could do this to. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=133.76s)]
*  Most people don't even know what i'm talking about. If we did have those maybe things wouldn't be so fucking fucked up. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=137.28s)]
*  Okay, well that's. Get kids doing this. Yeah, there you go. With the sharpener. You're in the make America great again camp there. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=141.6s)]
*  He's not totally wrong. All right. Okay, there you go. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=145.92s)]
*  Sounded more like your dad every day. All right. We're a mega curious podcast. Wait till we get to the movie tariffs. I know. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=150.64s)]
*  All right president sat down for a long meet the press interview where chris and welker asked him about the recession predictions [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=155.44s)]
*  That have accompanied his tariff policy. Uh, here's a sampling of his answers. Is it okay in the short term to have a recession? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=160.72s)]
*  Look, uh, yeah, it's everything's okay. Are you worried it could happen? Do you think it could happen? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=168.8s)]
*  Anything can happen. When does it become the trump economy? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=175.04000000000002s)]
*  Uh, it partially is right now [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=179.6s)]
*  And I really mean this I think the good parts of the trump economy and the bad parts of the biden economy [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=181.92s)]
*  Are you saying that your tariffs will cause some prices to go up? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=187.6s)]
*  No, I think the tariffs are going to be great for us because it's going to make us rich [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=192.0s)]
*  But you said some dolls are going to cost more. Isn't that an acknowledgement that some prices will go up? I don't think a [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=195.44s)]
*  beautiful baby girl needs that's 11 years old needs to have [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  30 dolls, I think they can have three dolls or four dolls. They don't need to have 250 pencils. They can have five [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=206.32000000000002s)]
*  so true, um [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=213.84s)]
*  Just in case anyone thought he might have misspoken there. Here's what trump said when asked about this again [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=215.52s)]
*  on air force one sunday night [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=221.44000000000003s)]

*  Dolls she could be very happy with two or three or four or five [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=231.76s)]
*  I would I would let's not waste a lot of time. I'm gonna stick with what else i'd like americans to [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=236.56s)]
*  Look at an industry lift it up and ask themselves. Does it spark joy? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=242.48s)]
*  Him just listing off the ages of girls just creeps me out [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  The number of dolls the number of pencils the ages of the girls it's just changing everything he's doing he's doing a weave on this one [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=254.56s)]
*  um 15 year olds with dolls, but [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  It's not the part that's gotten the most attention [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  But when she said you'd be okay with the recession. Yeah, everything's okay. It'd be okay, which I think really nails [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=265.52000000000004s)]
*  He's like a philosopher. I know there's more than anything else [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=271.20000000000005s)]
*  He becomes I really uh when he becomes a kind of sage like figure which is we're all a bit too [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=274.08000000000004s)]
*  Materialistic in the long run. We're all dead kind of vibe. It's interesting. What do you guys make of trump's? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=279.74s)]
*  Insistence on sticking to this message. Are you surprised? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=286.16s)]
*  He's not just saying there won't be any recession or pain or need for sacrifice [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=289.04s)]
*  The guy is like not exactly known for telling hard truths [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=293.68s)]
*  Yeah, I I think there's a couple parts of it [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=297.68s)]
*  Part of it is like it's not dumb to do a little expectation setting when you know [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=300.64s)]
*  Your tariff policy is going to create some at least rocky shores financially in the short run [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=304.56s)]
*  But then he's betting that blaming joe biden for everything whether it's tariffs, uh the economy [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=309.2s)]
*  Ukraine immigration gaza all of it is some sort of get out of jail card free card [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=314.4s)]
*  And so I don't know that that when he gets to the 30 dolls versus three dolls [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=319.68s)]
*  It's so tone deaf because he doesn't realize that there are kids who can currently only afford three dolls, right? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=324.72s)]
*  We'll have zero dolls. That's the part. He can't compute [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=330.56s)]
*  I don't know if you guys saw this when people were posting a bunch of photos of his kids when they were younger [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=333.36s)]
*  Like driving around like little toy mercedes's and things like every toy you could ever imagine [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=338.88s)]
*  Yeah, of course. That's the money is love with him. So I think he's he knows he knows how to buy his kids 30 [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=343.36s)]
*  Dolls. Yeah, I I can't so first of all him saying uh, the good parts of the economy are me and the bad parts of the economy [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=348.56s)]
*  Are joe biden that's a joke. He's made real like that's what we were all joking about. It's incredible that he's just saying it out loud [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=354.24s)]
*  Uh, I can't tell on the 30 dolls front [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=360.08000000000004s)]
*  It seems like he knows he kind of fucked up and didn't say something exactly politically useful and now he can't [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=363.52000000000004s)]
*  He can let go of it. He can't back down interesting. It's true [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=369.36s)]
*  I i'm sort of with [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=372.56s)]
*  Tommy's point. Uh, I think he's just I know this is like perfect democratic messaging, but I think he's genuinely out of touch [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=374.08s)]
*  You know, I mean he's always out of touch [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=380.64s)]
*  But like this is like a this is lucille bluth not lucille with the lucille with the candies [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=382.4s)]
*  This is lucille bluth. What is it? Well, this is from last night. So call back from last episode [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=387.67999999999995s)]

*  He never did which is that's the tone what he has become accustomed to not only from his staff now [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=469.52000000000004s)]
*  But from the reporters that he faces every day they all praise him [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=474.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's uh, and so to foreign leaders and so to business people everyone is praising him now because everyone [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=477.44000000000005s)]
*  Is either they're afraid of him or they want to suck up or they're looking out for themselves [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=482.72s)]
*  So he's it's very rare that he is challenged [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=485.52s)]
*  well it isn't it isn't because on the one hand, yes, he's sort of pushing ap and Reuters aside to make room for uh, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=487.68s)]
*  uh, right wing gazette and marjorie taylor green's boyfriend just to [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=493.68s)]
*  Slather on the love with him [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=498.15999999999997s)]
*  But he is sitting down for a ton of interviews with combative reporters over and over again [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=499.59999999999997s)]
*  And you know, he seems genuinely surprised every time each time one of them asks a challenging question [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=504.96s)]
*  Yeah, like terry moran just blew his big break. Yeah by asking a challenging question [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=510.24s)]
*  It's a shame back to the miners for you terry moran terry I chose you [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=515.76s)]
*  Because I didn't know who he was [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=520.56s)]
*  Incredible, uh former congressman trey gowdy said on his fox news show didn't know until this that he still has a fox news show [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=523.6s)]
*  Uh that trump should triple down on this message with an oval office address [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=529.6s)]
*  Where he'd presumably talk more about why our kids need to give up their dolls and pencils. Um, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=534.0799999999999s)]
*  Carl rove had a very funny response to that. I think we have a clip [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=539.84s)]
*  So I thought it was really problematic when he said well, you know what the kids that you know [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=542.64s)]
*  Those little girls at christmas, they don't need 30 dolls. They can do it too [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=546.72s)]
*  And if they have to pay a couple more bucks for them, you know, okay. Well, it sounds like mr. Scrooge. It's carl rofe [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=549.84s)]
*  Yeah [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=556.72s)]
*  the [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=557.6s)]
*  it's uh [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=558.96s)]
*  Also, you know boys play with dolls [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=560.5600000000001s)]
*  And obviously that's not the most important part of this [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=562.48s)]
*  But you know and shout out to the little boys out there who want a doll for christmas and very few young children use pencils [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=564.5600000000001s)]
*  No, none do it's weird that trey gowdy's kind of become a voice of reason [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=570.0s)]
*  He opened that segment criticizing trump for talking about invading greenland and canada [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=573.12s)]
*  And then rove made some smart points. I thought he talked about how trump hadn't visited the border yet [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=577.52s)]
*  Why hasn't he visited the border? It's the only thing you seem to care about sir [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=582.24s)]
*  Why wouldn't you just go to the border and take some credit the oval office address idea is absolutely stupid [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=585.28s)]
*  Oh, I disagree. It's an antiquated understanding of the media. I want to say trump would own us libs so hard [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=590.64s)]
*  He gave a primetime oval office address on why americans must sacrifice more for his trade war [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=596.96s)]
*  It's i want to see it. Stephen miller is gonna outwrite you too. Yeah, please don't do it. Don't do it. You'll get us [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=603.5200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we'll be gone. It's so like this idea that like no no [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=608.08s)]
*  Like we need to sacrifice for fucking what for what it's sacrifices to make ourselves poorer [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=611.9200000000001s)]
*  And other nations poorer and basically everyone poorer [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=618.0s)]
*  For [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=620.8000000000001s)]
*  That is the goal I guess sacrifice so that donald trump can as he's told the atlantic run the world and everyone has to beg him for [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=623.0400000000001s)]
*  Exemptions and this and this deal and that deal he just wants to be the center of everything [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=630.0600000000001s)]
*  I guess it's just sort of like hey like we're gonna have a couple christmas [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=633.9200000000001s)]
*  With more expensive dolls because in a few years, they'll be american-made dolls [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=637.0400000000001s)]
*  Is that is that what we're meant to like what I guess so from their own point of view [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=641.12s)]
*  What is the sacrifice for it's just not clear. No, uh also rove said that the um pope photoshopped [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=644.32s)]
*  Was very offensive as our resident catholic. Were you seeing a lot of chatter about catholics upset about that photoshop thing on your pay-per-seek [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=650.72s)]
*  So there's so much to be offended by [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=657.84s)]
*  even even if you're a [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=660.88s)]
*  Devout catholic there's so much to be offended by from donald trump that I don't think the uh [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=662.72s)]
*  The image of the pope is going to do much. I would say especially if you're a devout catholic, right? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=668.4s)]
*  But it's your religion for example, for example his immigration policy, uh his uh his his policy towards the poor [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=672.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they tend to trade all that stuff for the the cruelty to people they don't like and the big hats [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=679.2s)]
*  Not pope francis [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=685.6s)]
*  But the uh, I talked about the dan on the youtube, uh who made fun of me for saying the youtube like chuck schumer [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=688.96s)]
*  but I don't care, uh, but uh [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=694.1600000000001s)]
*  There are all these dumb things that trump is doing that are worth making fun of [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=696.8000000000001s)]
*  I do think when it tilts over into it's going to cost him the catholics in ohio because this is so offensive [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=699.84s)]
*  It's like are you offended or you just hoping people are offended like I don't know [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=704.88s)]
*  Yeah, I was just surprised your rove say it and there's someone uh fox and he was asked trump about it today in the press briefing [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=707.92s)]
*  So I just didn't know if there's a critical mass of angry catholic, uh photoshop gates. Yeah [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=713.52s)]
*  There's a few uh conservative catholics that are like this this [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=719.68s)]
*  Is what's going too far this has got you know jd vance thinks it's a thinks it's a joke and just [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=723.68s)]

*  I think all of them they kind of like [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=750.72s)]
*  Remember in in the 2008 campaign bill burton told all us little young com staffers that we had to call 10 reporters before 10 a.m [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=752.72s)]
*  I think they have to pick like 10 twitter fights before 10 a.m [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=758.96s)]
*  With annoying libs and that's just kind of how this white house operates [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=761.6s)]

*  Uh, this came after he wrote a piece in the wall street journal about trump's economic strategy [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=792.56s)]
*  Besant's taking a sunnier approach [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=797.4399999999999s)]
*  He's telling everyone that we're close to making trade deals. The economy is going to be quote humming during the second half of 2025 [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=799.52s)]
*  I don't know. It does feel like this is a play to like calm the market mark to calm the markets [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=806.7199999999999s)]

*  yeah, it just seems like clean up because uh, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=820.88s)]
*  Steps one and two are undoing the damage from what they've already done. It's like step first first things first [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=824.4799999999999s)]
*  I want you to stop worrying about all the harm we've already caused. We're in the process of trying to unwind some of that harm [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=829.68s)]
*  Yeah, uh step two is the tax cuts [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=834.4s)]
*  We've already been talking about for months and step three is a bunch of I guess [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=836.16s)]
*  You know ai server farms. I guess that's something to look forward to right the policy is like white label republican policy [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=839.68s)]
*  It's like tax cuts and deregulation and then these stupid tariffs that are causing all the problems [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=845.36s)]
*  Let me read you one line from this op-ed though. Mr [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=849.84s)]
*  Trump intends to usher in the most prosperous decade in american history [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=851.92s)]
*  But not at the cost of the spiritual degradation of the working class [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=854.88s)]
*  Did that give you a bit of like a joey a job is about more than a paycheck [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=858.24s)]
*  I feel like that was an edit from the vp's office, huh? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=861.36s)]
*  Because that's the that's the he's going into the sort of right wing view [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=865.28s)]
*  That like we must bring the manufacturing back because the jobs we have now [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=869.6800000000001s)]

*  Hollywood sign outside of the plane window. He saw the truth post from trump sunday night [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=932.86s)]
*  That was a little bit of a surprise where trump announced that he would be expanding his trade war to the entertainment industry [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=938.24s)]
*  Uh, the president posted that our movie business is quote dying a very fast death [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=944.08s)]
*  As other countries steal our entertainment jobs and make films that are just quote messaging and propaganda [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=948.88s)]
*  So he's directing his administration to implement quote [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=954.34s)]
*  A 100 tariff on any and all movies coming into our country that are produced in foreign lands [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=958.02s)]
*  Foreign lands is title case. Uh trump was asked about this in the oval on monday. Here's what he said our uh, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=965.7s)]
*  Film industry has been decimated [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=972.82s)]
*  by other countries [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=975.38s)]
*  Taking them out and also by incompetence like in los angeles the governor is a grossly incompetent man [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=976.82s)]
*  He's just allowed it to be taken away from you know, hollywood hollywood doesn't do very much [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=981.78s)]
*  Of that business to have the nice sign and everything's good, but they don't do very much. How about this guys? How are we? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=987.9399999999999s)]
*  How's it gonna work? How are we gonna tariff the movies? Yeah, I know it's hard when a lot of them come in through ones and zeros [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=993.3s)]
*  Start to figure out where to put the little uh, uh tax bill [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=999.54s)]
*  Yeah, when I saw this story, I swear the first thing I thought was this is john voight's fault [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1003.62s)]
*  I really did I was like john voight and it was and it and it turned out it really was although not really apparently [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1008.66s)]
*  He met with john voight, but did you read and it was either deadline or I can't remember which of the the trades it was [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1014.34s)]
*  john voight [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1020.74s)]
*  Talked to him about bringing production back and the tax incentives, but it said that he did not propose the tariffs [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1022.34s)]
*  No, no, no [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1028.34s)]
*  My assumption is that john voight has been taking these meetings to try to figure out there is a genuine problem which we can talk about [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1029.14s)]
*  But that he has been like as trump's ambassador to hollywood been trying to figure out what to do about how to try to bring [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1033.62s)]
*  But how to bring production back to the united states and to los angeles? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1038.58s)]
*  specifically which is really important and a serious problem and i'm sure he talked to donald trump about it and then it kind of [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1042.56s)]
*  Went through the fucking rub goldberg's contraption of trump's reign it came out with we're gonna tariff tariff [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1047.3799999999999s)]
*  And then at some point that will be kind of squeezed through some fucking broken chaotic policy process and emerges [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1052.74s)]
*  His victory his whatever real policy ultimate lands at the end of it [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1059.6200000000001s)]
*  That is not going to be a tariff on films made in foreign lands. Whatever the fuck that means [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1063.22s)]
*  Is it films is it tv2? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1068.0200000000002s)]
*  Is it is it some of the production overseas? Is it all of it? Is it where you shoot? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1070.1000000000001s)]
*  Is it where the production company is? [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1074.42s)]
*  None of this makes sense. Yeah the the so what's happening right now is over there's there has been a strike [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1076.9s)]
*  There was a pandemic had a terrible impact on the film industry [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1082.5s)]
*  Uh and television industry in california and in the united states [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1085.78s)]
*  over the last [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1090.18s)]
*  Decade or so lost a ton of production from california to other parts of the us and collectively the united states has lost a lot [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1092.1s)]
*  of production to canada australia [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1098.98s)]
*  europe the uk and the uk and [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1101.78s)]
*  It's a it's a genuine emergency. I do think [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1105.54s)]
*  California [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1109.78s)]
*  Government has been slow to respond but right now they really are genuinely responding carren bass has been talking about this ways to make [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1110.98s)]
*  It easier to shoot in los angeles. She's a little bit [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1116.5s)]
*  Hamstrung because it actually is a big state issue [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1119.3s)]
*  But they are trying to dramatically increase the amount of money that goes towards subsidizing production through the tax code [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1121.8600000000001s)]
*  Uh increasing the number of the types of productions that are eligible to receive it all of which will go a long way because [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1128.02s)]
*  The real crisis is that there's a ton of people that live in california [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1134.98s)]
*  Who are the best at what they do in making television and making film they live here because things were produced here [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1139.22s)]
*  And fewer and fewer productions are taking place here and a lot of the recovery that happened after the pandemic after the strike [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1144.18s)]
*  has gone elsewhere not just to new york or to uh to georgia, but also to to other countries and [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1149.94s)]
*  It's not wrong to say that california democrats [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1157.3s)]
*  Collectively have been slow on this but they're on it. They really are genuinely trying to figure out how to fix it right now [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1160.6599999999999s)]
*  That's also a policy question where to be on it is to like you said [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1165.4599999999998s)]
*  You know make get offer tax incentives change the tax code. Whatever else tariffs are a fucking terrible idea, especially since [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1170.1s)]
*  Uh, you know one of one of the many explanations rationales for the trade war has been the trade deficit, right? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1178.1s)]
*  on this instance we [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1184.02s)]
*  Export three times more content than we import in this country. So if we went the tariff route at all [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1186.18s)]
*  Other countries might start saying okay. We don't want america. We're gonna we're gonna put tariffs on american movies and american production that come here [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1192.82s)]
*  Yeah, I mean trump throws out ideas and we all sound insane trying to make sense of them. Yeah, that's stupid [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1198.9s)]
*  I have a few thoughts one [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1202.98s)]
*  industry [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1204.48s)]
*  one soul [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1206.02s)]
*  Not not industry always industry. I mean saint. I know too. He's calling it a national security emergency [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1207.22s)]
*  He's trying to do this. I think they're floating doing this under the typical aipa [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1213.22s)]
*  Uh the the the legal authority that are doing all the other terrorists, which would mean [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1217.46s)]
*  Declaring a tv and film national emergency, which is just so stupid again just to make fun of how stupid this is [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1221.7s)]
*  also the gavin newsome approach as you said love it it's to increase the tax credit from [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1227.22s)]
*  330 million to 750 million annually to try to bring back some of these productions to [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1231.3600000000001s)]
*  To the la area to the hollywood area but talking to someone in gavin's office today and they're like yes [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1236.9s)]
*  We have to do that part for [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1240.5s)]
*  Paramounts, but we also need to do more for like the person who works craft services on these productions help them find more affordable housing [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1242.82s)]
*  Better schools better services so they're trying to think of it in more holistic way and trump's just like I don't know tariff it [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1249.94s)]
*  At the core of this is yes [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1255.22s)]
*  There's just we need to be competing on the tax structure to get more production here [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1256.9s)]
*  But there's also just bureaucratic hurdles that need to be lifted that have to do with like, you know [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1260.66s)]
*  A lot of long-running problems california and it's just fucking expensive to be in california [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1265.94s)]
*  Which goes to the deeper problem we have about not building enough housing not building enough transportation. I'm sorry [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1269.62s)]
*  I'm just a little line has entered the chat abundant abundant. Are we abundant? Uh, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1274.34s)]
*  What are you saying about the word industry? He says industry. Oh, I'm driving crazy [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1279.06s)]
*  He said it was the one that the clip we just played that was the worst i've heard industry [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1283.6999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, film industry film industry very odd. He's saying it like are you saying industry and you want it to be in? [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1287.4599999999998s)]
*  You want it to be industry industry just quick, right? [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1292.6599999999999s)]
*  Anyway, you want it to be a dactyl I want it to be I don't know better [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1295.94s)]
*  It's interesting. You don't know which way this is going to go [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1299.22s)]
*  He said I don't want to hurt the film industry which the film industry believes they would be hurt by this [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1301.38s)]
*  um, so either some of them will come in and meet with them and then he'll you make something up or [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1306.02s)]
*  Some hollywood stars will go out there and yell about it and he won't like them and then he'll get dug in further [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1311.06s)]
*  And then we'll have a thousand percent tariff [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1315.78s)]
*  This would you never know this would kill like a disney for example [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1318.5800000000002s)]
*  Because they make the marvel movies and the star wars movies in england [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1322.18s)]
*  So if those movies are getting tariffed at 100 they are screwed [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1325.38s)]
*  The other part of this too is like the same problem with the fucking tariffs coming on and off and being so chaotic [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1328.5800000000002s)]
*  Like every other industry it takes months years to plan these things to be shot when they're going to be shot [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1332.98s)]

*  I'm sure you know who didn't have a good morning is ted sarandos because uh netflix most of their production is overseas [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1345.78s)]
*  Their stocks all went down like a couple percent. I mean they recovered when they everyone realized it was made up [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1351.38s)]

*  So this is just a naked form of bribery right out in the open [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1540.6799999999998s)]
*  Meanwhile trump's headlining a maga inc super pack dinner at one of his golf clubs in virginia monday night for quote-unquote crypto and ai innovators [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1545.56s)]
*  The price tag 1.5 million dollars ahead [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1554.04s)]
*  Kristen welker became one of the first journalists to ask trump about his crypto dealings during his meet the press interview. Let's listen [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1557.7199999999998s)]
*  You've branded your own [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1564.76s)]
*  crypto cryptocurrency [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1566.6s)]
*  The coins values actually surged recently after you announced that top holders would be invited to have dinner [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1568.6s)]
*  I don't even know that what did it surge to? [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1576.04s)]
*  What did it surge to? Yeah, what's it worth? You might as well tell me because I have no well 14.32 [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1578.76s)]
*  What? [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1585.8799999999999s)]
*  or [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1587.08s)]
*  No dollars per cryptocurrency billion dollars. No, but let me just ask you. What do you say to those who argue? [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1588.6s)]
*  That when they hear that they worry you're profiting from the presidency i'm not profiting from anything [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1596.2s)]
*  I'm just all i'm doing is you know be this I started this long before the election [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1600.3600000000001s)]
*  You're not profiting off of the cryptocurrency. I haven't even looked at your family. I'll tell you what look [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1605.48s)]
*  If I own stock in something and I do a good job and the stock market goes up. I guess [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1611.56s)]
*  i'm profiting [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1617.96s)]
*  But who really profits is somebody like nancy pelosi who uses inside information [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1619.8s)]
*  Do you uh, you think it's plausible he's not paying attention to any of this [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1624.6200000000001s)]
*  Absolutely, no chance. I was talking to someone in the crypto industry [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1628.8600000000001s)]
*  Today who said they believe that trump's family has probably made around a billion dollars in cash [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1632.06s)]
*  From their crypto ventures. We're not talking about unrealized gains of the coins. We're talking about [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1637.5s)]
*  Like transaction fees on the meme coin so they you get fees as you just said when they buy and sell the meme coin [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1641.9s)]
*  They think they made that much just on the transaction [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1647.5s)]
*  Yes, and also when you buy and sell the world liberty financial tokens the trump family is entitled to 75% of net revenue [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1649.26s)]
*  On those token sales and the family owns 60% of the company itself [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1656.54s)]
*  And by the way, there's like zero upside for the people who buy these tokens. You don't get any profits [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1660.62s)]
*  You don't get to trade them. It's like makes no sense. And also in that interview. He's like [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1664.06s)]
*  All up. He's like we started this long before I ran for office [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1669.1s)]
*  They started the company in september of 2024. It was right before the election. I mean this whole thing. It's like [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1672.06s)]
*  It the grip is so is staggering [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1678.0600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and by the way, we just we also like all of that is an estimate [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1681.1000000000001s)]
*  We don't know that there aren't people just like [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1684.94s)]
*  Putting just giving him giving him money like there could be huge amounts. They're just being just directly transferred to him into his wallet [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1687.02s)]
*  We'll have no idea [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1692.8600000000001s)]
*  There's no way to know that he could just someone can go to the oval and just show him their phone and be like look [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1693.5800000000002s)]
*  Like look what I gave you [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1697.98s)]
*  The only thing that's surprising is that freight technologies is so far the only company that we know of that has just spent 20 million [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1699.5800000000002s)]
*  dollars well to try to [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1706.86s)]
*  influence him on the trade to get an exemption for the trade war to influence the trade policy because I imagine if the tariffs stay in [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1708.78s)]
*  Place we'll be seeing a lot more of that, right? Yeah, I mean that's the only one on the trade war [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1714.6999999999998s)]
*  But there's a far more egregious example that's out there. So there's this emirati [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1718.62s)]
*  state-owned investment firm called mgx the president of the firm is like the [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1723.1s)]
*  The president of the u.a's brother or something runs a company [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1727.5s)]
*  They want to make a two billion dollar investment into binance [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1730.3s)]
*  Which is the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange and one that has gotten to a lot of legal trouble in the united states [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1733.42s)]
*  Because they were allowing people to like money launderer of eight sanctions criminal behavior [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1738.78s)]
*  Just like the wild wild west and the company paid four billion dollars [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1743.18s)]
*  To the government because of that and the the ceo did jail time. So mgx wants to buy a piece of binance [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1747.5s)]
*  For instead of doing it in cash for absolutely no reason they are purchasing two billion dollars worth of trump's stable coin [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1754.38s)]
*  It seems like some reason the only reason is for any favor with the administration because presumably it will cost them more than two billion dollars [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1761.02s)]
*  Because there will be a transaction fee on the purchase of the stable coins [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1767.26s)]
*  So that one transaction will make trump stable coin one of the biggest stable coins in the world [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1770.06s)]
*  And I think we're liberally will probably get paid on both sides because they'll probably get a fee when you buy the stable coin from them [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1776.1399999999999s)]
*  and then [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1781.98s)]
*  Normally the way these stable coins are supposed to work is they're supposed to be backed by something which they use to peg [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1782.86s)]
*  The value of the stable coin to like one dollar so presumably they'll buy treasury bonds or something [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1787.66s)]
*  And then they'll get the interest on those and by the way, that's like the safest version of this scheme [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1793.42s)]
*  We don't know that they'll actually buy treasuries because we don't know how this works [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1797.18s)]
*  So again this emirati state-owned company is just going to buy two billion dollars worth of trump coin [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1800.46s)]
*  For no reason the stable coin the trump stable coin will eventually be pegged to the milania stable coin [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1807.9s)]
*  right it'll just be [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1814.14s)]
*  You want you know what the american people are getting pegged hey, that's what's happening here. Yeah, I wish you know what I mean? [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1815.66s)]
*  the [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1821.66s)]
*  doesn't [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1822.46s)]
*  But uh, what were we talking about? Are they pegging? No, but the the I was thinking about this too, which is like there's this kind of um, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1823.66s)]
*  I don't know this feeling of like [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1831.42s)]
*  They're openly corrupt [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1833.42s)]
*  And this kind of feels like okay and then because republicans in congress don't care [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1835.1000000000001s)]
*  Uh, it leads to nothing and [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1839.42s)]
*  I do think we need to be talking about this because I think it's really important [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1842.14s)]
*  I do think people really care about this just for the politics of it. This is important to our politics [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1844.22s)]
*  but I think long term we need to be thinking about [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1847.82s)]
*  How do we how do we start talking about a these are crimes people are committing? [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1850.94s)]
*  Uh federal crimes every day all the time and just because your friends are doing it [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1855.98s)]
*  It doesn't mean it's not a federal crime just because everybody's applauding in the ballroom doesn't mean you're not part of a federal crime [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1859.42s)]
*  But then you have to also assume that donald trump is going to use the pardon power [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1864.06s)]
*  That they're going to try to find ways to to to wiggle their way out of this and it would be [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1867.5s)]
*  I think a lot about that that jonathan [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1872.54s)]
*  last piece around pascal's wager and the bet that democrats [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1875.1799999999998s)]
*  will never um [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1880.86s)]
*  Seek retribution and will behave really responsibly and always try to look forward and we really do need to start talking about [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1883.02s)]
*  what we will do to investigate these crimes and make these and and [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1888.3799999999999s)]
*  Uh look back and make sure people pay a price for having been brazenly and openly [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1892.46s)]
*  Corrupt even if republicans won't do it so that the crypto industry will then dump a couple hundred million dollars on that democrat [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1897.5800000000002s)]
*  Who said they'll investigate the crimes in the next election. It isn't tough. It's just talking about that. It's yeah [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1904.14s)]
*  But I mean well look we can [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1909.9s)]
*  How much does that money get you right? [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1911.66s)]
*  Like we just went through a round of of of in wisconsin where elon's money could not buy them [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1913.5s)]
*  Right like we have to we have to try we have to try it [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1918.5400000000002s)]
*  Well senate republicans have been trying to pass a bill with new rules on the stable coins [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1920.8600000000001s)]
*  that they thought had enough votes from [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1925.66s)]
*  more pro crypto senate democrats [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1928.38s)]
*  To pass they had enough to pass until nine of those democrats just announced over the weekend [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1931.5s)]
*  Led by ruben gaego that they'll oppose the legislation [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1936.22s)]
*  Republicans were reportedly stunned by this news. Are you guys stunned by this news? [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1940.2s)]
*  No, I mean I the the politics are complicated for the reason you just mentioned because I think the [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1945.42s)]
*  The crypto industry spent like 130 million dollars last cycle on either pro crypto candidates or to [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1949.82s)]
*  Target anti-crypto democrats even ones who were not anti-crypto at all [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1957.3400000000001s)]
*  Their number one target was sherry brown [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1961.66s)]
*  Former senator from ohio [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1963.9s)]
*  I think that one crypto pack spent 40 million to defeat him and that was like their head on a pike to send a message [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1965.18s)]
*  and [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1970.8600000000001s)]
*  I've been told by someone today that getting sherry browned is like a is a verb now on capitol hill [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1971.98s)]
*  And so latinic howard latinic and david sacks were trying to ram this crypto bill through congress democrats [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1977.5s)]
*  I think we're trying to figure out how to like be for something because they don't there's like there's not just the crypto money [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1982.14s)]
*  But then there's a constituency [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1987.66s)]
*  That likes crypto that thinks it's exciting that thinks traditional financial services are broken and rigged against them and they're not wrong [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1990.38s)]
*  But we don't need like a worse version backed on the blockchain right and like getting that message through is really hard [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=1998.6200000000001s)]
*  but I think what happened here is [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2003.9s)]
*  trump's stable coin [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2006.22s)]
*  Corruption with the uae was so brazen that even the member of the democrats who are for this in committee were like, okay [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2008.2800000000002s)]
*  We can't do this right now because this would essentially [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2014.7s)]
*  Allow like trump put out an eo saying he has control of independent financial regulators [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2018.5400000000002s)]
*  And this bill would give him the authority to regulate the stable coin market as he is entering it [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2023.76s)]
*  And like that is just insane and it would also give big tech companies the ability to issue stable coins [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2028.8799999999999s)]
*  So you would see like oh jesus x coin on from elon musk or like libra [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2034.48s)]
*  I think was the version that came out of facebook and so that they stopped they stopped because traditionally like [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2039.12s)]
*  There was an effort on like 2005 [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2045.36s)]
*  Someone was reminding me that walmart basically tried to launch a bank and we tried to keep those two things separate because it's really bad [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2048.0s)]
*  But now the outcome of this bill passing in a bad form would be you would have like bank like companies [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2053.52s)]
*  Performing bank like services with no banking regulations. Also you get it's crazy [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2059.44s)]
*  You get one bite at the sample on legislation and you know [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2063.7599999999998s)]
*  Gallego was saying he's like they should not have been stunned [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2066.08s)]
*  We worked with them for weeks and months to try to make the provisions in this bill have real teeth and like have real regulation [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2068.16s)]
*  He's like and then the version that showed up on the floor didn't have like it was just weakened [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2075.68s)]
*  He's like so i'm he he was saying he's like i'm happy to [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2080.0s)]
*  Continue working with them to make it stronger [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2082.64s)]
*  But like don't you know they're not going to water down a crypto regulation bill at the same time that the president is just [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2084.96s)]
*  You know inviting people to bribe him [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2090.32s)]
*  Look, there's a there's a nuanced debate. I suppose around crypto around the tech not the blockchain technology [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2093.36s)]
*  The ways it can make life better. There are our genuine applications [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2099.84s)]
*  But the concern voice from the beginning is this is going to be a tool for crime and corruption [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2103.84s)]
*  It is currently the most brazen and grand corruption tool in the history of our country [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2108.48s)]
*  That's it. I don't unless I mean, I don't know if you guys are experiencing day to day the the benefits of the blockchain [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2115.2799999999997s)]
*  But but what i'm seeing is the most corrupt [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2120.64s)]
*  administration in history using it to enrich themselves to the tune of billions of dollars donald trump never been a billionaire maybe for [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2123.66s)]
*  You know whether or not donald trump's ever been a billionaire [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2128.96s)]
*  He is one now because of just complete and total corruption because of crypto. Yeah, so the democrats on the committee like [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2130.72s)]
*  Elizabeth warren, they're trying to improve the bill by being like hey [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2137.04s)]
*  What if it said the president and members of congress can't get into the stablecoin business? [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2139.84s)]
*  How about that or like big tech can't either or we got to apply consumer protections? [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2143.92s)]
*  To stable coins, but I think the republicans on the committee are trying to exempt stablecoin regulations from the cfpb for example [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2149.1200000000003s)]
*  So there's all the consumer protections are going to go out the window [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2157.04s)]
*  Yeah, and they can't cross the administration or the trump family in any way, right? [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2159.76s)]
*  They're there to serve but like the rubin guy who goes to the world look [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2164.32s)]
*  I understand people are trying to work on this stuff in good faith [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2166.6400000000003s)]
*  But like at the end of the day the crypto industry fucking hates you right like it is run by people like mark and reason who have a radical [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2168.8s)]
*  Libertarian vision of the world they view you as the enemy they will not think twice about dumping [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2176.1400000000003s)]
*  Tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars on your head in the next election and just go in there [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2181.52s)]
*  Eyes wide open because like you're not saving yourself from these people [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2186.56s)]
*  Uh trump also made plenty of news over the weekend on meet the press and elsewhere regarding his continued attack on the constitution [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2189.68s)]
*  Particularly its separation of powers and amendments protecting free speech due process and the right to counsel [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2195.7599999999998s)]
*  Those are big ones. Yeah, those are big ones [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2201.2s)]
*  I didn't even mention here s tier apart to the constitution. I don't even mention cruel and unusual punishment [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2203.68s)]
*  I probably should put that one in too. Uh, here he is answering a question about defying court orders [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2207.6s)]
*  Your secretary of state says everyone who's here citizens and non-citizens deserve due process. Do you agree? [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2212.4s)]
*  Mr. I don't know. I'm not i'm not a lawyer. I don't know well the fifth amendment says I don't know it seems it seems [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2218.0s)]
*  It might say that don't you need to uphold the constitution of the united states as president? I don't know [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2225.52s)]
*  I have to respond by saying again. I have brilliant lawyers that work for me [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2231.2799999999997s)]
*  And they are going to obviously follow what the supreme court said [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2237.12s)]
*  What you said is not what I heard the supreme court said they have a different interpretation [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2241.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, steven miller has a different interpretation. He is not a lawyer [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2246.1s)]
*  Um on the bright side trump did say that running for a third term in 2028 is quote not something he's looking to do [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2249.1400000000003s)]
*  And then he name dropped vice president jd vance and surprisingly [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2255.86s)]
*  national archivist [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2259.38s)]
*  Marco rubio [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2260.82s)]
*  Uh, who currently holds three other titles as well secretary of state usaid administrator and now national security advisor big shoes for little marco to fill [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2262.1800000000003s)]
*  Uh, so trump's now using this talk to my lawyer's answer every time he gets a question on disobeying the courts [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2269.78s)]
*  What do you guys make of that? [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2275.2999999999997s)]
*  Uh, it seems like he went to I have to talk to my lawyer's answer too quickly [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2276.74s)]
*  Like he was still processing her previous sentence when he got to like, you know, you have to uphold the constitution, right? [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2280.66s)]
*  He's like, I gotta talk to my lawyers. It seems like but wait wait wait, that's like you took an oath [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2285.22s)]
*  It's like the first sentence of the oath. Yeah, I mean we we sort of talked about this last week, too [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2289.3799999999997s)]
*  It's the most beta [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2293.54s)]
*  passive aggressive way to start a [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2295.14s)]
*  Constitutional crisis ever like the big strong man who says I alone can fix it is now like oh I gotta [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2297.6s)]
*  I gotta defer to my lawyer's you've been railing against the courts non-stop for years and now you're deferring to them [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2302.18s)]
*  This is just a simple difference of opinion on legal precedent. What are we talking about? [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2307.38s)]
*  Yeah, he's attacking the judges every day [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2311.14s)]
*  He's like he was at the rally in michigan for 100 days and he was like the judges are taking your president's power away [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2313.62s)]
*  But I defer to my lawyers. Well, he won't right. It's it's the footsie with defying the orders. They're still [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2319.62s)]
*  Look, they they see john trump sees all the polling and he can pretend it's not real all he wants [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2325.22s)]
*  But he sees it. He knows that defying court orders deeply unpopular [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2329.3s)]
*  Deporting people without due process deeply unpopular [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2334.1000000000004s)]
*  So when he's in front of christian welker and he's asked directly about this [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2336.42s)]
*  He does not want to come out and brazenly say [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2339.46s)]
*  He is going to violate the supreme court [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2342.26s)]
*  So he leaves it to stephen miller to go out there and sort of rant about how the [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2343.94s)]
*  Rule and really said it was nine oh in my favor and actually we are following the order because the order technically doesn't require us [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2347.54s)]
*  To do anything at all and as steven miller did today as a follow-up to this interview said [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2352.5s)]
*  No due process is for citizens. It is not for immigrants who aren't here legally, which is just a lie [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2357.78s)]
*  Which is like it's a lie. It's been litigated for like hundreds of years. What's the plain language? [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2362.9s)]
*  It says person but even if you leave it to the courts to interpret person and what it means, right? [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2369.3s)]
*  Uh the the most recent ruling in april [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2373.14s)]
*  Uh on uh, brego garcia. We even had fucking alito and thomas [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2376.58s)]
*  Uh jumped in and said yes, of course due process [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2381.06s)]
*  He said then they they said due process is afforded to all people immigrants who are here legally or not as the government has agreed [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2384.66s)]
*  In this case the trumps owned doj said that plus rubio and but miller's out there being like no, it's not true [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2392.58s)]
*  Imagine like the the counterfactual imagine if it were not the case if you're a green card holder and the government could just [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2399.2999999999997s)]
*  Threaten to punish you unless you what gave them money supported them politically like [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2406.3399999999997s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense that what steven miller's argument is is nonsensical. It's completely unamerican [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2410.58s)]
*  I mean the washington posted an investigation over the weekend another one about uh ccot and el salvador and who ended up there [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2415.54s)]
*  and they found uh [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2422.1000000000004s)]
*  Two people at least two men were sent there, uh, even though they had already been approved for uh as refugees for resettling [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2424.02s)]
*  Four people were sent there even though they had legal protections to avoid being sent there because they had temporary protected status [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2431.78s)]
*  So already people who are here legally who had been who had gone through a process here were sent to a foreign gulag [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2438.42s)]
*  We're only talking about abrigo garcillo because he's the only one that the government admitted [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2446.9s)]
*  In a court filing they sent uh mistakenly it it's so stupid on its face [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2451.14s)]
*  Due process is for only people who deserve due process [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2457.06s)]
*  Okay, how do you figure out who those people are? [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2461.2999999999997s)]
*  Well, you have to have some kind of a process the process that they are the process dhs decides now [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2463.86s)]
*  You know who's who's a criminal who's not they have evidence trisha mcglofflin puts it out on on twitter [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2468.5s)]
*  And she said we have plenty of evidence and intelligence that said this person's a danger [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2473.78s)]
*  Say what is the evidence they go? We're not going to tell you it's it even just at face value [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2476.82s)]
*  It is predicated on the fact that a the government is acting in good faith and b if the government makes mistakes [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2480.7400000000002s)]
*  They will try to rectify it. They are acting in [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2486.26s)]
*  Despicable bad faith without regard for these people and it is their official position that if they even that even when they admit a mistake [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2488.6600000000003s)]
*  They have no uh ability or need to rectify it [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2496.1800000000003s)]
*  Uh, so this is this is dangerous. It's so obviously dangerous on its face. You guys find that 2028 answer any more? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2499.5400000000004s)]
*  Assuring than the previous comments on the topic. It's real weird that you led with rubio rubio is not magga [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2508.1000000000004s)]
*  He's just pretending his real beliefs are down he wants to keep he wants to keep the celebrity apprentice going, you know [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2514.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you can't have jd vance getting too high on his own supply. He's got to make it. Everyone's got to feel needy [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2519.3s)]
*  They need the boss's approval [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2524.1800000000003s)]
*  look, you know, we're at the point where president states is like, uh, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2526.9s)]
*  Joking around about violating the constitution to stick around. He already tried to do that when he committed an insurrection. So [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2532.02s)]
*  And then you got jd vance doing interviews. It's like [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2539.46s)]

*  Judge barrel howell said that the order itself was unconstitutional and opened her [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2647.2999999999997s)]
*  102 page ruling with a line from shakespeare the first thing we do [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2651.14s)]
*  Let's kill all the lawyers and wrote that quote eliminating lawyers as the guardians of the rule of law removes a major impediment [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2654.82s)]
*  To the path to more power in not as good news trump renewed his pledge on friday to take away harvard's tax exempt status because it's quote [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2661.54s)]
*  What they deserve? [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2669.06s)]
*  harvard's president alan garber did an interview with the wall street journal calling the move highly illegal [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2670.7400000000002s)]
*  Uh and an unnamed trump administration official did say the reporter that trump's post did not constitute [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2675.3s)]
*  A formal directive to the irs sure sure [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2680.98s)]
*  Uh, you guys think that the perkins win and harvard's willingness to fight will uh, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2685.3s)]
*  Maybe stiffen the spines of other law firms and colleges and institutions that trump's targeting [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2689.86s)]
*  I I hope so. I think we've been [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2694.58s)]
*  I think two things have happened that have made uh people uh realize that there's value in fighting one has been seeing the positive response [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2697.86s)]
*  to [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2705.78s)]
*  The institutions that do fight and the fact that they're winning in court [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2706.7400000000002s)]
*  The other is the relentlessness of trump's attacks on the places that have compromised right and the fact that once you capitulate to trump [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2710.1s)]
*  He doesn't leave you alone [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2717.46s)]
*  All right. He's still he's still going after abc news [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2718.9s)]
*  He's not going to give them a break because they did their 16 million dollar dirty deal. You saw what he did a terry [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2720.98s)]
*  Yeah, he like he or terry or terry, uh, he's still going after columbia [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2725.38s)]
*  Uh, they're relentlessly going to go after columbia even though they did this kind of a deal [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2730.42s)]
*  So I think and then all these demands that in interview after interview [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2734.42s)]
*  He's basically saying that all these law firms that capitulated admitted guilt [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2738.9s)]
*  uh, and then there are then then some of their clients are starting to to think about going elsewhere to report that i think [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2743.62s)]
*  Microsoft right is thinking about leaving. I can't remember which one of these fucking interchangeable firms in my brain [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2748.6600000000003s)]
*  They're going to leave but uh, hopefully they're going to start to see negative repercussions [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2752.98s)]
*  So I think the combination of not getting what you think you're going to get out of this deal [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2756.26s)]
*  Plus seeing the positive response to fighting can't can't be anything but helpful [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2760.1800000000003s)]
*  Obviously, it was unconstitutional, right? Like we like you can't you know, the judge [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2763.54s)]
*  The judge was I mean, you know, I think the reason the judge used such, uh, [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2767.62s)]
*  Dramatic language here. It's like she's like, I don't know the first the fifth the sixth amendments violates all of those [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2772.82s)]
*  um, also she made an example of [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2779.62s)]
*  The firms that capitulated is also part of the reason it was unconstitutional because she's like well [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2782.26s)]
*  The reason that you know [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2786.6600000000003s)]
*  It wasn't for uh, they didn't take you know [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2788.1800000000003s)]
*  That this executive order didn't target these firms for reasons that weren't political is because of the ones that capitulated [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2790.5s)]
*  Suddenly didn't have the eo targeted at them anymore, which is the same thing where this is why the unnamed official said, you know [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2796.28s)]
*  The uh his post about harvard. It's what they deserve. That's not going to hold up well in court [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2802.52s)]
*  I'm trying to roll back the harvard's tax exempt status. They didn't need the they didn't need the fucking [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2807.2400000000002s)]
*  Tweet or whatever true social posts to make clear that this was targeting because donald trump has been talking about it and all the [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2812.6800000000003s)]
*  Administration been talking about it openly by the way [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2817.96s)]
*  There's tons of record in the negotiation between the administration and harvard that we can't see that would certainly come out [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2819.96s)]
*  Uh, uh, and by the way, even if you take it at face value [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2825.56s)]
*  No, you can't make some claim that we are targeting harvard because of anti-semitism and so therefore we're going to [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2828.7599999999998s)]
*  Eliminate funding across a broad swath of research. That's like the definition of an unconstitutional first amendment violation [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2834.8399999999997s)]
*  Not just to liberal judges, but to conservative judges. The the problem here, right is of course, it's unconstitutional [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2841.7999999999997s)]
*  The lawyers knew it was unconstitutional disney's lawyers because they're lawyers disney's lawyers knew that the case against uh, [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2846.68s)]
*  Fucking george stephanopoulos was bullshit. They they gave in right paramount knows that the that the lawsuit against cbs is fucking bullshit [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2853.08s)]
*  It's because they're saying it's not worth winning [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2860.04s)]
*  They're saying it's not worth winning because donald trump is such a headache [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2862.6s)]
*  Well, and also the the the heads of these law firms [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2865.4s)]
*  I understand there were actual real business pressures like if you're ahead of a firm and you know [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2867.4s)]
*  Some other firm is trying to poach your clients because they think you can't represent them because you can't go into a government building [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2871.08s)]
*  That sucks. I get that but the the people doing these negotiations thought they could be cute [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2876.2799999999997s)]
*  And just agreed to do pro bono work on like helping veterans or stopping any semitism and trump is like actually [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2880.6800000000003s)]
*  You're defending the coal industry. Yeah, here we go [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2886.28s)]
*  The q anon shaman. Yes exactly and like like the firms that capitulated publicly [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2890.2000000000003s)]
*  Um are getting most of the shit as they deserve [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2894.84s)]
*  But you know someone from paul weiss was saying look when we were first making the deal with donald trump or talking donald trump [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2897.96s)]
*  We were looking for allies. We were looking for people who would stand with us [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2903.2400000000002s)]
*  And say no and what the people were what our competitors were doing instead was poaching our clients and taking our partners [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2906.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's correct. Yeah, and I do think it was a like [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2913.56s)]
*  And from going forward now that we know that he's losing in court over this kind of shit [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2916.44s)]
*  Like all the colleges and universities all the other law firms other media places like should stand together and not be fucking afraid [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2920.92s)]
*  Yeah, harvard through the first brick. It's done well [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2927.0s)]
*  I'm always said that [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2929.32s)]
*  main in main janet mills governor main remember [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2931.8s)]
*  Uh trump yelled at her in the in the governor's meeting because uh that he was going to freeze funding and he tried to freeze funding in [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2934.3599999999997s)]
*  main education because she was not abiding by his trans policies and uh, just one court [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2941.3199999999997s)]
*  And uh and the government had to back down and they unfroze the funding in main. So looks like you can take on trump [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2947.48s)]
*  Yeah, and not have to worry about it. Um, let's yeah, I mean look [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2953.08s)]
*  Yes until there's a fucking fire fire or flood or natural disaster and like I I everybody should fight but like we should like [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2956.6s)]
*  The point was never that these people thought they couldn't win in court. I think they all believed that they could win in court [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2964.2799999999997s)]
*  It's just whether or not donald trump is going to abuse his power and make like difficult on other matters, right? [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2968.68s)]
*  Whether it's in michigan whether there's no well anyway, well, and that's why you have to fight anyway [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2973.56s)]

*  Yes, right [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2982.2799999999997s)]
*  Like that is why you need to go find allies and you need to stand together because he is not as powerful if they all stand [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2982.68s)]

*  There are now multiple reports that the administration is looking at more places to deport people beyond al salvador [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2991.16s)]
*  including libya rwanda angola equatorial guinea and moldova [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=2996.6s)]

*  Trump directed his administration to quote in all caps rebuild and open alcatraz [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3019.32s)]
*  Because our country quote will no longer be held hostage to criminals thugs and judges that are afraid to do their job [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3025.32s)]
*  In the oval on monday trump talked at length about the inspiration behind his plan to reopen the notorious san francisco prison facility [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3031.88s)]
*  Let's listen. How will you use it? How did you come up with the idea? [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3038.12s)]
*  Well, I guess I was supposed to be a movie maker. We're talking if we started with the movie making it will end. I mean [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3041.16s)]

*  Democrats were not to have are not fighting back enough on just uh, you know him fighting regular crime [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3161.0s)]
*  There always has to be another threat, right? [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3167.08s)]
*  This is the whole because he's an authoritarian and so we always have to be just on the verge of being overrun by criminals [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3169.08s)]
*  Like we can put them in our supermax prisons forever if we want. Yeah, this one isn't even a threat to me [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3174.68s)]
*  It's just like a headline grab. It's like I don't know like reopen alcatraz. I don't care at all [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3179.24s)]
*  No, I like that tour. Yeah, it's a good tour. You're right kids go there. They get to walk around [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3183.8799999999997s)]
*  I was talking to someone and it's a little bit strange when you think about it [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3188.68s)]
*  It is a little bit now that I think it is a little weird [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3190.8399999999997s)]
*  But al capone went there suffering tour. That's one of their own titles. It is a great movie the clini's movie [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3193.56s)]
*  I was talking to someone in gavin's office today about this and I was like have you seen any like economic assessments of what he's like [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3198.7599999999998s)]
*  Why are we talking about this? Seriously? This is not a serious idea [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3204.2s)]
*  Um also the but the rwanda piece of tending migrants to rwanda [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3206.68s)]
*  I just want to point out was aboris johnson idea from 2022 [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3209.96s)]
*  They were trying to send people who sought asylum in the uk [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3213.48s)]
*  To rwanda and then forcing them to go through their legal process [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3216.6s)]
*  And if they're granted asylum, they would have to stay there [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3219.08s)]
*  So we're stealing this one from the floppy-haired idiot across the pond libya. That's a good one [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3220.76s)]
*  Just we're just really really safe places [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3226.28s)]
*  And so this is you know, like we are constantly conflating what he's doing to people by sending them to to el salvador [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3229.0s)]
*  This would just be [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3235.24s)]
*  Deporting people to this to these places and they that would be where they'd have to rebuild their lives [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3236.52s)]
*  And presumably it would be because their home country wouldn't take them back [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3241.56s)]
*  Correct, although none of that makes sense because my understanding is that venezuela is now taking deportation flights that leave out of honduras [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3245.72s)]
*  They just didn't want to send their planes to the united states [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3253.56s)]
*  Because there was concern under the alien enemies act that those assets could be seized by the u.s [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3256.2799999999997s)]
*  Government and claimed under forfeiture also over the weekend [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3260.92s)]
*  I believe this was part of the washington post reporting the investigation is that it turns out [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3264.1200000000003s)]
*  The their discussions with venezuela were going well, even when they ended up sending people to ccot [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3269.2400000000002s)]
*  Willing to take some we had rick cronel like a good like former human twitter troll came to life became a person [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3275.1600000000003s)]
*  Wanted to be secretary of state didn't get the job [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3282.2000000000003s)]
*  But he was going down on these little missions to go see maduro and trying to get back people [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3283.7200000000003s)]
*  Americans who were in prison and he tweeted I think like the day [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3287.3999999999996s)]
*  They sent all these venezuelans to al salvador that he had gotten a deportations agreement signed with the maduro government [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3291.16s)]
*  And it really is why like I don't like talking about this in terms of immigration because it's not about immigration [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3299.64s)]
*  It's not even about deportations [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3304.12s)]
*  Even renditions is hard because renditions like they're trying to they're trying to get intelligence out of the person [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3305.8799999999997s)]
*  This is this is just literally just literally sending people [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3310.4399999999996s)]
*  Uh to a prison for the rest of their lives in a foreign country based on no trial no due process [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3314.44s)]
*  Nothing, that's what it is. And as the the [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3321.4s)]
*  Like, you know trump today is saying oh we're gonna give everybody a thousand dollars if they self-deport [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3325.2400000000002s)]
*  Oh, yeah, right to send migrants to countries that they have no familiarity with a lot of this is about [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3328.84s)]
*  Uh scaring people. Yes for sure terrifying people into not coming and if they are here to leave [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3334.6s)]
*  I think that's partly why they won't give an inch even in these even where they've already admitted like in abrigo garcia [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3341.88s)]
*  The case that they've made a mistake. It is all about instilling fear in people as a means of [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3347.96s)]
*  Getting people to never come or leave and there's just a there's a dehumanizing [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3355.88s)]
*  Aspect to this too, whether it's intentional or not, and I believe it's intentional [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3361.08s)]
*  But I mean there was some there's some crime on the subway in new york and they were all out there [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3364.7599999999998s)]
*  Stephen miller the white house caroline levitt like screaming at the new york times for not detailing the person's immigration status who committed the crime [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3369.96s)]
*  And like demanding that the new york times so now I guess every time someone commits a crime in this country [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3378.36s)]
*  We need to know exactly what their immigration status is. This is also behind the whole he's not he'll never be a maryland man [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3383.32s)]
*  He'll never be a maryland father. He's a ms-13 [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3389.8s)]
*  So like you can't even now say that immigrants who aren't here legally [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3392.76s)]
*  You can't say like where they live in the united states or where they're from or the fact that their parents the only [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3396.52s)]
*  Identifier has to be that they are illegal and not here [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3401.46s)]
*  By the way, the the crime that they were all tweeting about that happened in the new york subway was a man [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3405.08s)]
*  Raping a corpse. Yes, and the in the mega people were like, why did you say he was an illegal immigrant? [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3410.6s)]
*  I'm sorry. That's not that's not the part of that story that burying the lead that worries me the most [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3415.56s)]
*  That's not the part that shocks my conscience his immigration status [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3421.7200000000003s)]
*  Also, if we're gonna I mean we're gonna start listing everyone's immigration status that commits a crime in this country [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3424.92s)]
*  It's not gonna look good for what they're trying to prove here, right? [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3429.4s)]
*  That's not since most of the crimes aren't [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3432.6000000000004s)]
*  And wait till they hear who commits crimes in women's restrooms [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3436.84s)]
*  Yeah, no, but seriously it's like this is this is their playbook, right? [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3440.6000000000004s)]
*  Like if a crime is committed by one of their unsavories, that's really important if it's not it shouldn't be mentioned at all [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3443.32s)]
*  It's bad. All right, we're gonna take a quick break. Uh two announcements before we do that [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3449.48s)]

*  Um, do they manipulate you at bedtime the way my daughter does me just like for extra seconds extra seconds [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3750.68s)]

*  Yeah, so sometimes she'll tell us she wants not that pink lovey, but that other identical pink lovey and she started to [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3781.0s)]
*  Fake cry but then halfway through made herself crack up [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3787.24s)]
*  Yeah, and we just like had this moment where we like all were laughing about knowing she was manipulating us [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3790.84s)]
*  And it's just like the funniest thing too [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3796.2s)]

*  And it's really hard to make them go away [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3811.48s)]
*  Uh, and then like he had doesn't have a favorite one though [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3814.28s)]
*  So every night it's like I want little bear and like I have now learned that little bear is the tiny white bear [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3817.2400000000002s)]
*  Because there's 15 bears in there [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3823.16s)]
*  But of course, it's always the one that you can't find 100. Yeah, turn the lights back on look under the bed [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3825.3199999999997s)]

*  Fledged, you know family member. I love that because that's how we are too [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3847.56s)]
*  Yeah, um, why'd you write the book and what's kind of the deeper message, you know for the parent reading the book? [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3851.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I mean our kids are about to turn four. So it's weird to think that I wrote this book [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3856.2s)]
*  I believe before they turned two [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3860.7599999999998s)]
*  I was coming home from a work trip [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3863.9599999999996s)]
*  Uh and had been thinking about writing a children's book because I had asked around for books that looked like our family [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3866.2799999999997s)]
*  Um, as you know, you read 15 books every night. It would be great if just one of those books featured a family that looked like ours [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3872.8399999999997s)]
*  Uh, and we we came up short. There are a couple good ones out there and it was also important to me that [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3880.44s)]
*  Uh, you know the lesson in the book was just a family loves each other unconditional love for your child [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3885.96s)]
*  It wasn't kind of punching you new face with like the morals, right? [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3890.52s)]
*  So, uh, I was on an airplane [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3894.7599999999998s)]
*  And and the idea came to me how excited I was to get home and how excited my kids might be that that i'm coming home [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3897.56s)]
*  Uh, and that was it. I just wanted a a nice sweet story [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3904.68s)]
*  Especially for bedtime was kind of thinking of you know, the book that incorporates, uh that message of unconditional love for your kid [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3908.36s)]
*  But also with you know, some silly things in there that they're gonna latch on to yeah, it's very cute [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3914.6800000000003s)]
*  I think I think the little kids, um, they'll like the way the story escalates [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3919.48s)]
*  Yeah, I don't want to ruin the ending for anybody. Yeah, they helped me write it right because there's so many [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3923.7200000000003s)]
*  Things that they decide to bring to the airport to greet papa with and that was fun to work with gus and panel pion [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3929.1600000000003s)]
*  I would workshop it and see if they'd giggle or not. Perfect. I love it [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3934.6800000000003s)]
*  um [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3937.96s)]
*  You know you talk about the the need for representation in books like this. Yeah [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3939.16s)]
*  Republicans they love to make [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3944.2599999999998s)]
*  LGBT parents the focus of their attacks their culture war like things are demagoguing [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3947.22s)]
*  You and pete get singled out in like very [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3952.6s)]
*  Terrible ways by some of these horrible people. How do you deal with it? [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3955.8799999999997s)]
*  Is that something you have to talk to your kids about? [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3959.96s)]
*  Well, luckily no right now right I can shield them from the internet. They're they're only three [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3962.44s)]
*  um [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3967.64s)]
*  You know, we we try in our house to leave the discourse at the door [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3968.7599999999998s)]
*  It's very hard. It doesn't need to be at the dinner table [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3971.8799999999997s)]
*  Uh, it doesn't need to be in the minivan on the way to school. We don't need to be talking about [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3975.08s)]
*  you know [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3979.3199999999997s)]
*  Negativity while our kids are around. Yeah, like another thing about tucker carlson gus [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3980.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, well like, you know, the kids are talking to you and there's like spaghetti flying at their table [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3985.7999999999997s)]
*  Right. It's like hey, did you see this crazy thing that you know, caroline levitt decided to say say like [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3990.6s)]
*  Why does that need to be in our kitchen? Why does that need to be at our door? [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3994.7599999999998s)]
*  And you know, i'm i'm no stranger to the attack [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=3997.4799999999996s)]
*  Um, but I have always believed that the best thing that we can do [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4000.3599999999997s)]
*  For our community [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4003.7999999999997s)]
*  Um, and our family is just to live our lives authentically to show people who we are [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4005.08s)]
*  We're just like every other family, you know going about our day reading 15 books [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4009.0s)]
*  At bedtime and you know, there's probably a lot of applesauce and mac and cheese stuck to our [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4013.3199999999997s)]
*  Kitchen table chairs just like yours to the dog [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4018.12s)]
*  Yeah, buddy loves it buddy's like a rumba. Yeah, my dog has gained 15 pounds probably but um her fur is just [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4021.0s)]
*  Violent music you've got to groom because it's like, you know, there's constellations in there [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4027.8799999999997s)]
*  Um, the book is coming out at a time when books like yours are being targeted [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4031.56s)]
*  Challenged banned taken to court. What is it like to debut this book while the supreme court is hearing this case? [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4036.4199999999996s)]
*  It's mark mood versus taylor where parents are trying to pull kids out of lessons with just you know, lgbt characters like this [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4043.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I started writing it like I mentioned two years ago [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4050.2799999999997s)]
*  So didn't see the supreme court case coming and now of course it's it's coming out in a couple weeks and [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4053.4s)]
*  I just keep thinking about what a kid like ours might feel [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4057.88s)]
*  Uh sitting in a classroom where someone says like I don't want to I don't want to read that [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4062.44s)]
*  I don't want my kids exposed to that when it's simply a book about you know, two loving parents going about their day [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4066.1200000000003s)]
*  And at the end of the day loving their children unconditionally [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4072.28s)]
*  um, so [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4075.32s)]
*  You know, i'm really disappointed [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4077.32s)]
*  Especially to see that the conservative supreme court seems to be favoring, uh the parents in this particular case [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4079.4s)]
*  Um as a former teacher myself, I think that's going to put a lot of [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4086.2000000000003s)]
*  Unnecessary burden on teachers in schools [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4090.02s)]
*  I mean the school district in that particular case already said they tried it right and it and it failed it didn't work [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4092.52s)]
*  It was so cumbersome [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4099.08s)]
*  To constantly deal with those communicating what's going to be in the lesson and letting people opt out and but then look [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4100.76s)]
*  Where does the line you know get dropped? [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4106.52s)]
*  Right, right like I want to pull my kids out of lessons about you know evolution or like how many permission slips are we sending? [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4108.6s)]
*  You know every day or every week to pull our kids out of certain lessons [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4115.8s)]
*  Um, so again like this book it was very important to me that this is a father's day book [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4119.0s)]
*  It's just a book about two dads, uh, who love their kids. I think it's like a modern american family [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4124.84s)]
*  Um, and so I I hope that other families will enjoy it. I hope it brings a lot of joy to to bedtime [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4130.92s)]
*  Um, but again, i'm not naive and understand like what we're up against as a community and as a country [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4137.8s)]
*  um, so [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4144.68s)]
*  Not to be like, you know the guy out here hocking his book [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4146.5199999999995s)]
*  But like a great thing that you can do is request books like this at your library and at your school [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4148.84s)]
*  Um, because I do think it represents who we are as americans [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4153.96s)]
*  Um, and there's room for everybody at the table. It also works, you know, I mean like it does normalize like [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4157.96s)]
*  Families that look all kinds of ways. Yeah [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4163.639999999999s)]
*  Um as a as a educator, I mean I imagine [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4166.28s)]
*  When you were teaching like the kind of libs of tik tok kind of like these assaults on on teachers [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4170.2s)]
*  Like yeah, they probably weren't happening. But I mean do you talk to educators? Are they scared of? [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4176.76s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know being singled out being targeted [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4181.64s)]
*  Well, I think this this administration [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4184.6s)]

*  Um in in our case where uh, a kid is left at the hospital [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4361.0s)]
*  The hospital works with an adoption agency to make an adoption plan [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4366.4400000000005s)]

*  Uh the nursery don't buy anything [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4394.6s)]
*  because when [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4397.24s)]
*  One of those cases might inevitably fail [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4399.16s)]
*  It hurts. Yeah to look at the crib to look at the room to look at the nursery. Um, [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4401.96s)]
*  Uh and have it fall through [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4407.24s)]

*  Um, you get the call in the middle of the night. There's a situation [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4421.64s)]
*  Are you guys ready to step up? We'd say yes, and then you know, it turned into 1 a.m [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4425.96s)]

*  And this is one thing I really admire about him is he can talk to anybody and he can hold his own [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4962.759999999999s)]

*  But kind of sexual innuendo or whatever and he's like, yeah, it's gonna [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=4992.679999999999s)]

*  It's probably getting that for me too. Like i'm just like a constant, you know role of puns and jokes [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=5009.72s)]
*  And so he's he's pretty good at tuning out what he what he doesn't want to respond to it's a necessity in this [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGxawEdGR5w&t=5015.72s)]
