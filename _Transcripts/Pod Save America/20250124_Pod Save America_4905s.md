Video Description: Donald Trump makes good on his promise to free the January 6 rioters—including those convicted of savage violence against police officers—calling the attacks "very minor incidents" in a primetime interview with Sean Hannity, and saying it would be too "cumbersome" to review individual defendants' records. Jon and Dan react to the pardons, the expansive list of executive orders that Trump signed this week, the prospects for his cabinet picks, and how Democrats are doing in their efforts to push back. Then, Dan talks to progressive strategist Faiz Shakir about his bid for DNC Chair and where he wants to steer the party.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Trump Pardons Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, and J6 Rioters Leaving Republicans Scrambling
**Pod Save America:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g)
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Jon Favreau. I'm Dan Pfeiffer. On today's show America's golden age has begun Dan [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=0.0s)]
*  We'll talk about the first week of Donald Trump's second term and try to separate the signal from the noise [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=8.2s)]
*  Though there was quite a bit of the latter during the president sit down in the oval with his pal [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=13.16s)]
*  Sean Hannity on Wednesday night [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=17.42s)]
*  There was also a cat fight [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=19.32s)]
*  Between two of Trump's billionaire friends that broke out over which one of them gets to help control the artificial intelligence that could destroy civilization [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=21.72s)]
*  So that's fun [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=29.28s)]
*  We'll also talk about what Democrats might learn about how to fight back from an Episcopal bishop and a pod bro and [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=30.44s)]
*  Speaking of Democrats DNC chair candidate Fash Shakir [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=36.92s)]
*  One of the smartest voices in progressive politics stops by to talk to Dan about why he's running and how he's different [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=40.16s)]
*  But first as of Wednesday evening Donald Trump had signed by our count 48 executive orders and actions and generally spent the week [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=47.28s)]
*  making [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=55.56s)]
*  Drastic changes to the way our country is governed and how our society views itself some of this we previewed on the Tuesday show [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=56.6s)]
*  But here's a sample of the moves that got the most attention [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=62.72s)]
*  Trump ordered a review of the Biden administration's investigative actions quote to correct past misconduct [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=66.8s)]
*  Related to the weaponization of law enforcement and the weaponization of the intelligence community [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=73.2s)]
*  He withdrew America from the World Health Organization and the Paris climate agreement [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=77.92s)]
*  He's also pausing all leases for offshore wind farms and incentives to buy electric vehicles [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=82.62s)]
*  He's sending US troops to the southern border and building a mass deportation force of federal agents to begin immigration raids [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=87.9s)]
*  He's also directed federal prosecutors to criminally investigate state and local officials who resist the coming deportations [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=94.74s)]
*  But Trump's also going after legal immigration [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=101.78s)]
*  He signed an order trying to end birthright citizenship for the children of immigrants who aren't yet citizens [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=104.5s)]
*  Even the ones who were here legally on visas. He suspended our asylum and refugee programs [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=110.36s)]
*  He signed orders directing the federal government to dismantle all diversity equity and inclusion [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=116.52s)]
*  Programs and jobs to no longer officially recognize transgender Americans to freeze all federal hiring and make it easier to replace [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  Non-political civil servants with Trump loyalists, which he is already doing [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=130.12s)]
*  He gave top-secret clearances to White House staff without going through background checks [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=134.4s)]
*  And he also canceled the security clearances of 51 people who signed a letter [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=138.44s)]
*  Casting doubt on the hunter Biden laptop thing [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=142.4s)]
*  He's renaming Denali over the objections of Alaska's Republican senators and the Gulf of Mexico [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=145.4s)]
*  Over the objections of anyone whose brain hasn't been broken [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=151.68s)]
*  He signed an order directing all executive departments and agencies to deliver emergency price relief to Americans [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=155.0s)]
*  Who didn't realize the Commerce Department was responsible for the price of eggs [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=162.04s)]
*  And last but not least he has issued pardons and commutations for all of the January 6th defendants [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=166.67999999999998s)]
*  Regardless of the severity of their crimes [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  Huh? So that's a lot [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=178.27999999999997s)]
*  We're gonna spend some time on the pardons and immigration in a bit, but beyond those two big issues [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=181.04s)]
*  What from this list really matters the most what matters lest and what is just a bullshitty talking point? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=187.95999999999998s)]
*  I think other than the renaming various things on various maps [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=193.83999999999997s)]
*  we should take all of it pretty seriously even even if the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=197.23999999999998s)]
*  Order seems more symbolic or so legally dubious that even this Supreme Court is likely to strike it down [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  because it's all sends a message to the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=207.32s)]
*  Project 2025 goons will be running this government about what they should do right the the order on [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=210.67999999999998s)]
*  Investigating the investigations to understand the web position of government. That's kind of a fake thing [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=217.2s)]
*  But that is a signal to cash Patel and the people who work from people in Pam Bondi's DOJ [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=221.96s)]
*  That we want to investigate these people right even if the order doesn't mean that much [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=227.12s)]
*  The it sends a dangerous signal to dangerous people and so we should take it quite seriously [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=231.04000000000002s)]
*  Having to choose amongst this list of terrible things as the thing that's most terrible is pretty hard [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=236.76000000000002s)]
*  But for me the stuff I'm most concerned about is all the climate stuff. It is pulling out of Paris [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=242.12s)]
*  it is getting rid of [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=249.04000000000002s)]
*  The electric vehicle incentives in part because on climate it's the one thing we don't have time to waste, right? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=251.56s)]
*  we're already behind schedule and trying to get where we need to get to [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=258.76s)]
*  keep the planet alive and [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=263.08s)]
*  Wasting another four years on Donald Trump is deeply dangerous and it's time [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=265.15999999999997s)]
*  We can't get back on some of these other things [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=270.08s)]
*  We if we can survive these four years you can go back and you can undo the worst policy does you can issue new? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=271.84s)]
*  Executive orders you can pass new laws on climate. We're never gonna get those years back and I think that comes at a great cost [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=278.8s)]
*  Yeah, I think the climate stuff is is pretty horrible. I think probably the most bullshitty [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=285.08000000000004s)]
*  executive order [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=290.24s)]
*  Is the one on price release and in bringing down inflation? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=291.52000000000004s)]
*  because the idea that [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=296.20000000000005s)]
*  the Biden administration had [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=298.28000000000003s)]
*  Levers within the federal government to lower prices and didn't pull them [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=300.44s)]
*  Even if you think that they don't really care at least they care about [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=304.76s)]
*  Staying in power you think just just would have been just would have been more popular to have lower prices [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=307.79999999999995s)]
*  So you think they would have done that but that's probably because there are no levers in the federal government [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=312.7s)]
*  Breakdown prices that Joe Biden hadn't already tried over the last four years. So that is clearly [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=317.79999999999995s)]
*  Window dressing and just sort of bullshit [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=323.52s)]
*  Let's talk about the January 6th pardons, which [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=326.59999999999997s)]
*  while promised by Trump during the campaign [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=331.23999999999995s)]
*  I think it's fair to say we're not expected to be this broad [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=334.28s)]
*  pardons and commutations [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=338.4s)]
*  Even for people convicted of brutally assaulting police officers and for the leaders of the proud boys and the oath keepers [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=340.08s)]
*  Which are two far-right paramilitary groups [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=346.59999999999997s)]
*  Those two leaders had been found guilty of seditious conspiracy as recently as January 12th [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=350.28s)]
*  Vice president JD Vance said while defending potential pardons for nonviolent offenders [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=355.64s)]
*  Quote if you committed violence on that day [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=360.84s)]
*  Obviously, you shouldn't be pardoned JD Vance if you committed violence on that day [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=365.0s)]
*  Obviously, you shouldn't be pardoned [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=371.44s)]
*  Not so obvious to JD Vance's boss who according to reporting from notice [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=373.96s)]
*  Decided to extend the pardon to even the most violent criminals because of the blowback to Vance's interview from Trump's base [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=378.4s)]
*  According to Axios Trump said fuck it release them all [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=386.03999999999996s)]
*  Trump did an interview with Sean Hannity on Wednesday night where he talked about his reasoning [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=390.28s)]
*  number of reasons number one they were in there for three and a half years a long time and [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=395.12s)]
*  In many solitary confinement treated like nobody's ever been treated so badly [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=399.56s)]
*  because they knew the election was rigged and they were protesting the vote and that [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=405.71999999999997s)]
*  You should be allowed to protest about you should be allowed to you know the day when the day comes [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=410.76s)]
*  You shouldn't be able to invade the capital ready [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=415.4s)]
*  Most of the people were absolutely innocent. Okay, but forgetting all about that [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=418.0s)]
*  It would be very very cumbersome to go and look, you know, how many people are talking about? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=422.56s)]
*  1,500 people almost all of them are [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=428.56s)]
*  Should not have been this should not have happened. They were very minor incidents [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=431.64s)]
*  Okay, you know that they get built up by that a couple of fake guys that are in CNN all the time [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=436.03999999999996s)]
*  What do you watch it? They were very [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=441.88s)]
*  minor [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=444.0s)]
*  Incidents, I'm so angry about this. I [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=445.24s)]
*  Want to talk about Michael Fanon for a minute. It's a DC police officer [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=448.68s)]
*  He was beaten within an inch of his life on January 6th wasn't even on duty that day [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=453.84000000000003s)]

*  After he pleaded guilty to assaulting an officer with a dangerous weapon he walked out of the courtroom. He screamed Trump won [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=528.0s)]
*  He was sentenced just about a year ago. And now he is free no shorter sentence [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=535.04s)]
*  free and [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=541.12s)]
*  now [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=542.84s)]
*  Michael Fanon is trying to get a protective order because the rioters who were pardoned are now threatening to go after the people who sent [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=543.84s)]
*  them to prison I [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=551.6800000000001s)]
*  Don't know what to do with that Dan. I mean it is [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=554.28s)]
*  so [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=558.32s)]
*  deeply [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=560.72s)]
*  dangerous and [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=562.28s)]
*  The way Trump talked about it is just it's pure gaslighting. All right. None of what he's saying is true [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=563.64s)]
*  No, nothing that he describes happened the way it happened. These are not peaceful protesters [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=568.8000000000001s)]
*  it's an entirely made-up reality to justify this pardon and [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=574.76s)]
*  What is it's all belied by video evidence? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=579.24s)]
*  Testimony from the people who were there testimony from some of his allies and former aides and [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=583.36s)]
*  He has created this false right reality and I think the scariest thing about it is he clearly believes it [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=588.0s)]
*  It's a lot of things Donald Trump says that he obviously doesn't believe [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=593.4399999999999s)]
*  He has convinced himself about what happened on January 6th that it is something [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=596.76s)]
*  For there was not violent in the way it was and that that violent the violence that did happen was justified [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=601.56s)]
*  it was on his behalf and [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=606.4399999999999s)]
*  It's it it is quite [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=609.2s)]
*  Quite scary and look for all the Republicans and other people who think oh, we're gonna relitigate January 6th again [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=611.5200000000001s)]
*  And we're looking back [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=618.6400000000001s)]
*  This is actually about the future why this is so dangerous because now [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=620.24s)]
*  Donald Trump has pardoned all of these right-wing [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=625.88s)]
*  extremists who were armed who committed violence who are [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=630.88s)]
*  Not apologetic at all [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=635.6s)]
*  Who are not you know maintaining their innocence either they know they're guilty they said they're guilty they're not apologetic and now they're out of prison and [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=638.24s)]
*  other [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=647.08s)]
*  Right-wing extremists who might want to cause violence [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=648.48s)]
*  now know that if you commit violence in Donald Trump's name, then he's gonna he's got your back and [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=651.9200000000001s)]
*  So why wouldn't they commit violence again there are now they're all talking about revenge [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=658.2s)]
*  Revenge against the people who testified against the prosecutors against the judges who put them in prison [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=661.84s)]
*  and so like when the proud boys come to your community and [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=667.48s)]
*  Start marching or menacing people or whatever the hell they do [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=672.8s)]
*  What are the police gonna do knowing that when last time a police officer? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=676.8s)]
*  Was beaten within an inch of his life that the perpetrator was just released are the police gonna protect us who's gonna protect people? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=681.8s)]
*  Because it's Donald Trump's whether or not Donald Trump thinks it's his private army. They think they're Donald Trump's private army [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=689.84s)]
*  That's what they think [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=695.44s)]
*  What does it say about the politics of the Trump coalition that they believed that it would be a huge political problem to not pardon [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=696.48s)]
*  right-wing militia groups [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=704.16s)]
*  Right that I mean that's where it is that that would be a political problem [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=707.12s)]
*  And I think the these pardons are the fullest expression of that famous quote from Frank Wilhoyt that went viral a few years ago [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=709.6s)]
*  Conservatism consists of exactly one proposition to win [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=716.36s)]
*  There must be in groups whom the law protects but does not bind alongside out groups whom the law binds, but does not protect [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=718.96s)]
*  If you support Donald Trump you have the full protection of the law [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=726.36s)]
*  If you do not support Donald Trump if you oppose him, then the law will be turned against you [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=730.04s)]
*  That is the message of Donald Trump on the first day of his presidency [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=735.0s)]
*  Meanwhile even before he sits down with Hannity [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=738.58s)]
*  Trump allies were having trouble defending these pardons. Let's listen to some Republicans [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=742.8s)]
*  Grateful the president Trump this president I don't want to pardon any violent actors, but there was real miscarriage of justice here [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=758.3599999999999s)]
*  So I'm totally supportive of it [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=767.0s)]
*  I haven't seen the details [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=770.36s)]
*  Again it's not ideal, but I'm not overly concerned about it either [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=779.96s)]
*  I think the gift is that it's all behind us now [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=784.44s)]
*  Pathetic I [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=789.72s)]
*  Think those Republicans I think every elected Republican should be asked that question [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=792.36s)]
*  Who refused to answer it should be asked that question every single day [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=797.0s)]
*  That any reporter can get in their face and put a microphone there [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=800.84s)]
*  Though the ones who are walking through Congress. I mean I just it [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=804.76s)]
*  At least at least answer the question at least have the courage to say yeah [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=808.64s)]
*  I support the pardons of the violent criminals who beat the shit out of police officers and almost killed them [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=813.62s)]
*  Yeah, I support it at least say that so they're just running away [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=818.36s)]
*  I [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=822.96s)]
*  Mean do you think that Republicans? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=824.6800000000001s)]
*  Can will pay a political price for defending this is this something that like you know is gonna is gonna haunt some of these members [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=826.92s)]
*  But when they're up for reelection in two years [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=833.76s)]
*  It will haunt them more if the reporters and others in politics are aggressive about continue to ask the question [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=836.28s)]
*  And we don't just give up after six days [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=841.8s)]
*  These reporters these capital reports many of whom also had their lives in danger on January 6 are gonna see these members every single day [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=843.6800000000001s)]
*  Are they gonna keep asking about this or are they gonna switch to their opinion on whether it's one bill or two bills or [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=849.3199999999999s)]
*  Whatever else like if they drive this then it has a greater chance of staying in the public consciousness [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=854.52s)]
*  The pardons are very unpopular right large majority suppose them even a significant number of Trump's most ardent supporters [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=860.48s)]
*  Don't think they're a great idea [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=865.8s)]
*  and I think we should Democrats just scream from the rooftops about this as much as we possibly can because most voters are not [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=867.16s)]
*  Gonna know this happened or they're not gonna understand exactly who he powered right and what those people did and what the consequences of that are [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=872.04s)]
*  But I do want to sort of level set expectations on the politics of this in the short term at least [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=879.0799999999999s)]
*  Because and this gets to what I think is one of the analytical errors that I made in 2024 when talking about this election [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=883.4s)]
*  Is we have to sort of understand the difference between? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=889.4399999999999s)]
*  What the popularity of an issue and how big a priority is for voters? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=892.64s)]
*  These partners were always unpopular every voter people said they did not like them [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=897.12s)]
*  They do not like it when Donald Trump talks about January 6 [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=901.12s)]
*  But in the end for most of the voters who were persuaded well this did not drive their vote choice [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=903.52s)]
*  Because they cared so much about [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=908.4s)]
*  Costs and immigration to a slightly lesser extent that they're willing to put up with a whole bunch of shit [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=910.92s)]
*  The Donald Trump was willing to do that [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=915.8s)]
*  They did not like if he was going to lower their costs so the price the political price of this is gonna come [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=917.88s)]
*  If and when prices don't come down as Donald Trump says or the border has not become more secure or America feels continues to feel [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=924.12s)]
*  more chaotic in the short term [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=930.64s)]
*  Is this gonna move things a lot probably not but it doesn't mean we shouldn't keep talking about it [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=933.28s)]
*  This is incredibly important. Yeah, I just I [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=937.08s)]
*  Get why it didn't move vote. I like first of all how many people? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=940.76s)]
*  Knew that he was promising pardons like this how many people knew exactly what these people did and [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=945.2800000000001s)]
*  It's a perspective promise during a campaign and it's not something that you're experiencing while you're going to the voting booth [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=951.8000000000001s)]
*  Now he's done the pardons now. We should be telling the stories of what happened [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=957.9200000000001s)]
*  Because I think this goes be like okay. What if prices do come down? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=963.32s)]
*  But there's still paramilitary groups roaming our communities, right? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=967.08s)]
*  like probably we should say something about that probably we should let people know what's happening and [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=971.48s)]
*  You know, I mean we'll get into the Democratic discussion about you know, how Democrats are responding but I [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=978.72s)]
*  Completely understand the driving force behind Trump's victory and probably the central challenge that has [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=986.32s)]
*  destabilized American politics has to do with [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=993.96s)]
*  people's living standards and [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=997.08s)]
*  yawning economic inequality in this country and [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1000.1600000000001s)]
*  So I completely understand that but sometimes I think you just have to talk about one thing and then you have to talk about [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1003.5200000000001s)]
*  The other thing you have to be able to talk about both [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1008.72s)]
*  Especially this far out from an election, you know [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1011.8000000000001s)]
*  Because I think this is this is the time if any time to seed the ground and make sure that people know [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1014.7800000000001s)]
*  What has happened and what the stories are? Yeah, I think maybe the way to think about this is and one of the [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1020.6s)]
*  Strategic errors of the first Trump term was we there was like this belief [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1027.14s)]
*  This intuition among so many Democrats that we were just like one thing away from people abandoning Trump [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1031.14s)]
*  They could just learn this one singular piece of information about him [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1038.46s)]
*  Then they would walk away and we spent a lot of time screaming about all of those things and [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1042.98s)]
*  The way to think about it now, right? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1048.06s)]
*  Because he just did this on the furthest distance possible from the midterms, right? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1050.26s)]
*  When he will actually have to be held accountable nationally for his political misdeeds [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1054.72s)]
*  Is we have to tell a story about Trump, right? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1061.1200000000001s)]
*  And not just about Trump about about the Republican Party in the Trump era [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1063.68s)]
*  It's probably the way to think about it and this this needs to be a piece of that story [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1066.44s)]
*  It's not just that we were just like he pardon these people they're bad [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1069.72s)]
*  Look at all the terrible things like what it means that that's gonna move things. This is like over time, right? [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1072.0s)]
*  We're not trying to move his numbers today. We're not trying to move his numbers tomorrow [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1076.16s)]
*  We're trying to make a case against him that is going to bear fruit for us when voters actually vote [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1079.0800000000002s)]
*  in Virginia and New Jersey in November and then nationally in the House and Senate elections next year [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1084.72s)]
*  what when you think about this that I've been thinking about is [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1089.68s)]
*  like [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1093.6200000000001s)]
*  our kids [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1094.8400000000001s)]

*  A skeet thread. Do not thread this. It doesn't have to be a thread. It can just be just make a point.

*  Like just stop reading the stage directions, please. It does tell me something about how [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1261.48s)]
*  Republicans view the politics of this. Mike Johnson gets asked about it and says we're [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1268.64s)]
*  We're not looking back. We're looking forward and then three hours later [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1273.92s)]
*  Mike Johnson announces that they're going to investigate the January 6th investigation [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1277.68s)]

*  Is that Donald Trump asked Mike Johnson to go investigate the January 6th committee and Johnson was like [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1287.6000000000001s)]
*  It's a little looking backwards [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1294.3600000000001s)]
*  I don't know [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1296.0s)]
*  But of course Johnson has to do whatever Donald Trump says because they are all doing whatever Donald Trump says [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1296.52s)]
*  There's no Republican left that is trying to actively oppose him [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1302.2s)]
*  We got a few Republicans who said they don't agree with the pardons good for them. Lisa Murkowski Tom Tillis some others [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1306.2s)]
*  But no one is making it. None of the Republicans are making a big deal out of it [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1313.52s)]
*  Yeah [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1317.52s)]
*  I mean there's in their minds and they're not incorrect on their short-term politics is if you're on the wrong side of Trump you're out [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1318.02s)]
*  Of the Republican Party, right? What do you think about the one excuse? [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1323.44s)]
*  You hear from some of them as well Joe Biden did all the pardons [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1327.16s)]
*  So Joe Biden pardoned his family and he did those perspective pardons for Fauci and Cheney [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1330.8000000000002s)]
*  And so if he's doing pardons and Trump's doing pardons all the pardons are bad [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1335.3000000000002s)]
*  I don't love Joe Biden's pardons particularly the one well [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1339.5s)]

*  I think that's a good move end [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1347.8400000000001s)]
*  but if you think [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1350.4s)]
*  That Donald Trump did all of these pardons in this way because Joe Biden did some pardons that the day that earlier that day [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1351.8799999999999s)]

*  Biden made probably slightly [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1370.76s)]
*  Leavened the political pain that could come from this because a lot of the coverage is [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1374.84s)]

*  He he gave the press an opportunity to do its favorite thing [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1385.72s)]
*  Which is default to the pox on both your house's narrative [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1389.78s)]
*  Once again, Joe Biden in his last move in the White House nailed the messaging and communication, you know [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1392.3200000000002s)]

*  it's gonna potentially ruin your reputation and so he is trying to [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1674.5600000000002s)]
*  Remove all obstacles to anyone who will stand up against them [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1679.5600000000002s)]
*  I think the other thing that has stood out to me about all of the immigration moves is [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1682.64s)]
*  Donald Trump's first term he basically cut legal immigration legal immigration [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1687.5600000000002s)]
*  By more than he reduced illegal immigration [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1693.88s)]
*  so again much like [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1698.0400000000002s)]
*  The cost of living and prices a lot of people voted for Donald Trump thinking there's a situation at the border [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1700.08s)]
*  They need to control the border [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1706.12s)]
*  You know, there's been an influx of immigrants coming into our cities that we can't care for this is a problem [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1708.12s)]
*  Can we get this under control and what Donald Trump is saying is actually I? [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1714.1599999999999s)]
*  Want to I want to go after legal immigration birthright citizenship [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1718.56s)]
*  Not just for people who've just crossed the border and had a child here [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1722.76s)]
*  No, this is people who are here on student visas each HB h1b visas [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1726.56s)]
*  People who are here legally now. He's he's suspending the refugee program refugees [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1732.8s)]
*  Refugees who we take into this country are the most vetted people of any immigrant when we take refugees and suspended the refugee program [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1738.52s)]
*  suspended asylum [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1746.0s)]
*  People like Steve Bannon in that wing of the party they want to cut legal immigration Stephen Miller wants to cut legal immigration [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1747.52s)]
*  They don't want the h1b visas that whole fight we talked about so [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1753.32s)]
*  It is hard to look at his immigration moves as moves that are about [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1757.52s)]
*  national security people safety [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1762.44s)]
*  Anything like that order in the immigration system and more about the Trump administration [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1765.16s)]
*  deciding that they [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1771.96s)]
*  Want to define who is an American and who is not? [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1773.48s)]
*  Yeah, the national security threat in the minds of Donald Trump and Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller is a diverse pluralistic society [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1777.82s)]
*  That's what they're trying to stop right and that and that anyone who [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1787.02s)]
*  represents change or diversity is a threat and that that applies to immigration applies to their policies on [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1791.74s)]
*  Dei programs and all of it and that is exactly what they're doing and I think this scary thing here is [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1798.74s)]
*  A lot of this is warm go for policy from the last time but they are just [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1803.8999999999999s)]
*  Implementing it faster more aggressively and seemingly with more precision than before [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1809.02s)]
*  They now know how to pull the levers of government in a way. They absolutely did not it was just a [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1813.34s)]
*  Cluster fuck the first time or they didn't mean what they're doing [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1818.3799999999999s)]
*  But if you remember the Muslim ban they they had to rewrite it like five times to get it through they made huge errors that [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1820.34s)]
*  Delayed implementation and now they're not for what we can tell they're not gonna make as many of those errors, right? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1826.28s)]
*  People in charge of things the entire government is on board with Trump's immigration plans and before there was a wing of the government [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1831.0s)]
*  That was for it and part of his White House that was resisting it right including his [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1837.32s)]
*  Some of his closest aides and in this case [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1841.72s)]
*  Everyone everyone is moving forward to do it and that and that's where it's the most scary [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1844.4s)]
*  Alright, this is what counts as lighter fare [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1848.96s)]
*  A mini drama erupted on Wednesday when Elon Musk went on the attack against a [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1851.28s)]
*  $500 billion AI initiative the Trump had announced the day before in the Roosevelt room with the Softbank CEO [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1860.08s)]
*  billionaire Trump donor Larry Ellison and [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1866.24s)]
*  Elon frenemy Sam Altman of open AI [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1868.6s)]
*  Elon responded on X quote. They don't have the money and then Sam and Elon got in a bit of a slap fight online [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1872.56s)]
*  What's going on here why why why is Elon Musk mad about the artificial intelligence? [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1878.92s)]
*  Initiative announced by his pal Donald Trump and all those other billionaires. I thought he loves AI [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1884.8000000000002s)]
*  He does he he does love AI I think but he hates Sam Altman more than he loves AI, right? [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1888.3200000000002s)]
*  He loves he loves his he loves his AI company. Yes. Yes, we're gonna get to right this [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1895.2s)]
*  in the big tech world in this club of billionaires it is [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1899.5200000000002s)]
*  Like it's all about money, but it's there it does there is a high school cafeteria element to this [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1903.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's a it's a little it's a little dick swinging contest [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1907.28s)]
*  That's what it is all the people at the outcast table in the high school cafeteria now are fighting over being at the cool kids table [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1913.52s)]
*  Yeah, and it's just keep in mind. Donald Trump is the cool kid. Yeah, what a fucking long run [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1919.36s)]
*  But Sam Elon and Sam Altman founded open AI together [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1925.36s)]
*  That Elon left it in dispute about its direction Elon then started a [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1929.36s)]
*  Competing AI model grok, which is part of Twitter [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1933.52s)]
*  he [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1937.36s)]
*  Does not like the people involved he did not I imagine did not like being on that stage because he [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1938.48s)]
*  Twitter does not have the money to be or x doesn't have the money to participate in such a endeavor like open AI and the others do [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1943.84s)]
*  And so he just did what he always did was just say what was the top of his mind without really thinking about it [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1950.48s)]
*  It's also watching Sam Altman who in in 2021 was tweeting [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1955.28s)]
*  Who in in 2021 was tweeting [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1960.16s)]
*  Thank you, Reid Hoffman for for everything you've done to help defeat Donald Trump [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1963.68s)]
*  And we're so lucky. He's not in the White House anymore. We've defeated Donald Trump. This is great [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1968.24s)]

*  Like what should we call him dangerous Donald? [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1978.96s)]
*  Like this is Sam Altman and then just yesterday or the day or this week he he posted on x [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1982.48s)]
*  Um, wow, you know, I think I was wrong about donald trump and now that I've met him in person [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1988.16s)]
*  I'm really excited about what he's gonna do for the country. Give me a fucking break, man [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1992.48s)]
*  I mean I I met Sam Altman in 2017 at a series of [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=1997.6000000000001s)]
*  meetings about trying to bring together political folks and tech folks on how to defeat donald trump and fight back against [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2002.72s)]
*  Mag extremism [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2008.72s)]
*  And now he's on stage is giving him billions of dollars now that he's free of your brainwashing dan your your liberal propaganda [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2010.24s)]
*  Uh that you were spouting at him that thank god he got to meet mr [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2017.5400000000002s)]
*  Trump so he could see firsthand how great he is [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2020.5800000000002s)]
*  So is elon elon like now the most powerful person in government and I say in government because uh, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2023.0600000000002s)]
*  He's gonna get a he's got a white house email and he's apparently getting a west wing office [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2028.8200000000002s)]
*  He was originally going to be in the eeob [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2032.5s)]
*  Old executive office building that's the one next to the the west wing because there's not a lot of not a ton of west wing [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2035.0600000000002s)]
*  Offices, but elon was not going to have that now. He's in the west wing with his buddies [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2039.7800000000002s)]
*  Uh, he pushed vivek ramaswamy out of doge. Vivek's now running for governor because apparently um, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2043.94s)]
*  elon didn't like his weird thread about uh, [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2050.66s)]
*  Saved by the bell and you know, we need to have more more [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2054.1s)]
*  More screeches and fewer zacks and all that kind of stuff, which you know point to elon on that [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2058.5s)]
*  Yeah, just that that was a misunderstanding of the plot of stay by the bell, correct, correct [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2064.1s)]
*  But so like is this is this is elon the most powerful person right now? [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2069.06s)]
*  Steve bannon was taking shots at him for this, uh open ai thing the fight with sam altman [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2072.26s)]
*  He was like donald trump needs to sit him down [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2076.6600000000003s)]
*  I can't believe that he's he's just out there and he's been brought into government now [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2078.98s)]
*  He's criticizing the president, you know, because bannon hates him. But what do you think of this whole thing? [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2082.34s)]
*  yeah, I think he's he is the most powerful person in government by far and one of the most powerful people in the world because [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2086.98s)]
*  He donald trump has limited leverage over him compared to everyone else [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2092.42s)]
*  Right anyone else can kick out of government. He can primary he can support a primary challenge against them [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2096.42s)]
*  He can use his twitter account or his truth social account to trash their reputation and send them all the people after him [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2100.58s)]
*  Elon has more money than trump. He doesn't need trump per se [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2107.7000000000003s)]
*  And he has also has a very [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2112.82s)]
*  Vicious aggressive very large online mob of people who support him and so you can see it donald trump treads [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2115.7000000000003s)]
*  Lightly around elon in no way. He does not tread lightly around anyone else we've ever seen. Yeah wonder how long it'll last [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2122.5s)]
*  um, so [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2128.6600000000003s)]
*  Uh that more from the hannity interview, uh, you know, they talked about a lot of other stuff [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2130.34s)]
*  Besides january 6. I think it's safe to say that both men were [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2135.78s)]
*  Really feeling it. They were really happy to be together. Let's listen after four long years president donald trump is back where he belongs [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2139.7000000000003s)]

*  somebody somebody advised joe biden [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2151.86s)]
*  To give pardons to everybody but him they wanted to take care of the economy. Yeah, but sure [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2156.02s)]

*  Maybe the sad thing [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2167.1400000000003s)]
*  Is he didn't give himself a pardon? [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2169.1400000000003s)]
*  and [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2172.82s)]
*  If you look at it [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2174.1800000000003s)]
*  It all had to do with him and I heard schiff went to him and and just begged him for a pardon because schiff is a crook [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2175.14s)]
*  I don't know if you watched the whole interview, but that clip he has like a sort of menacing tone, but is a little [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2181.7799999999997s)]
*  vague on investigating biden or schiff [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2188.58s)]
*  but at one point, you know [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2192.1s)]
*  Hannity asks him about just sort of you know vengeance in general and retribution and all that and [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2194.18s)]
*  He gets really angry and really dark and it's like I went through hell these last four years and you know [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2201.7799999999997s)]
*  Maybe people need to go through that like it was I I [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2206.5s)]
*  You know, we are on a watch what he does not just what he says [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2210.9s)]
*  Uh kind of uh kind of path here, but I hear something like that. I I left that interview thinking [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2215.2999999999997s)]
*  Oh man, he he really wants to do these investigations. Yeah, i'm 100. I mean he [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2221.3799999999997s)]
*  I mean implicit is doing a lot of work here, but he threatened biden [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2227.14s)]
*  Yep, repeatedly right see, you know seems weird seems unfortunate. He didn't pardon himself [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2230.98s)]
*  Like says it like six times. Yeah, maybe it's sad. Maybe it's funny [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2237.2999999999997s)]
*  You know you and I by based on a series of misbegotten professional decisions have are forced to watch all of the trump [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2240.18s)]
*  Hannity interviews over the last near decade [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2246.58s)]
*  and there was always this moment where he [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2249.22s)]
*  sees trump about to light himself on fire and he tries to use like gentle parroting techniques to [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2251.7s)]
*  shift the uh [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2255.94s)]
*  The interview onto safer territory and so you hear him in that clip being like I want to get to the economy [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2257.22s)]
*  Seriously, the economy high prices and trump's like I don't care. I want to talk about prosecuting my opponents [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2261.54s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's what we got. There was also by the way a very long discourse about the fires in la and smelt [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2267.4599999999996s)]
*  And turning the valve on in northern california so that the the water flows down to los angeles. It is uh [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2275.14s)]
*  That's like for the that's the old days. We would have played that [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2282.4199999999996s)]
*  Yeah [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2285.06s)]
*  But if you if you want to laugh or maybe you'll cry, uh, you know [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2286.26s)]
*  Go take a listen to that and we'll probably hear it again when he goes to los angeles on friday [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2289.86s)]
*  I'll tell you when we cry which is when he conditions [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2295.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2298.5s)]
*  A fire aid to california based on sending the water to la when the water doesn't go to la water doesn't go to la [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2298.9s)]
*  Doesn't go to la doesn't know what he's talking about [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2307.1400000000003s)]
*  The smite just he sees that the fish they're trying to save the fish and the fish [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2309.62s)]
*  How are we even saving the fish because don't fish need water? That's what [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2313.7s)]
*  I mean, I would like it's obviously absurd. But when you say something like that, like you see why people uh, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2318.3399999999997s)]
*  Believe them. It's like well your fish do need water [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2323.54s)]
*  Yeah, it does it does make sense that there would be a valve in northern california that you open in the water [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2325.94s)]
*  It's just he's even just a push one button and they won't push it [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2332.42s)]
*  It goes all the way because it might hurt the smell might hurt the smell donald trump has done a lot of [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2335.14s)]
*  Public appearances since the inauguration. He's speaking all that we've heard we hear donald trump multiple times a day [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2340.2599999999998s)]
*  uh [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2346.1s)]
*  is that [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2347.06s)]
*  Strategy is that it's just what he wants because he wants to be you know [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2348.3199999999997s)]
*  The country's host for the next four years like whoa, or is it uh, is there any risk to that for him? [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2352.3399999999997s)]
*  I guess there's no risk to anything because he's fucking [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2357.06s)]
*  He's president [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2359.8599999999997s)]
*  That's it he wins he's not running for he doesn't have to run again and he's immune for prosecution [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2361.14s)]
*  So yeah, there's very little risk to have to keep asking what the political damage for trump is [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2365.38s)]
*  I guess just so everyone knows, you know a weakened trump a trumpet back at lower 40 30 whatever [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2369.86s)]
*  You know that means um that bodes poorly for the midterms for republicans [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2378.02s)]
*  And I think probably if it keeps up for four years the same is true for 2028 [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2382.82s)]
*  But long way to go until we get there. So go ahead. Is it a strategy? [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2386.02s)]
*  Strategy [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2389.46s)]
*  No, in the sense that donald trump has always wanted to be this way [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2390.9s)]
*  He wants to be the center of attention at all times, right? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2393.78s)]
*  In tabloids putting his name on everything, uh hosting a reality show [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2397.06s)]
*  But it does also happen to be and this is why he's president for the second time in three elections is [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2401.38s)]
*  That sort of approach is also the way you should communicate in this media age is you have to be [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2407.7s)]
*  Omnipresent you have to be everywhere all at once you have to do everything never stop talking [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2412.96s)]
*  You can't abide by this [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2418.1s)]
*  this [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2420.5s)]
*  Philosophy that even some dem a lot of democrats will abide by which is [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2422.0s)]
*  The news of the day is the eos. So once i've done the eos, I should stop talking [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2425.6200000000003s)]
*  Until tomorrow and then we'll have another news day. That's not how the world works anymore [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2431.78s)]
*  It's just it's non-stop always talking always be there to command as much attention as you possibly can [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2434.98s)]
*  And that means that the people who don't pay a lot of attention have a greater chance of hearing you if you're always talking [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2442.1800000000003s)]
*  But it also means this is very key for trump that if you're always talking if you say something wrong if you make a mistake [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2447.3s)]
*  It hurts a lot less [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2453.46s)]
*  And so this is this this is the approach right? It is exhausting. It hurts my brain [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2455.3s)]
*  It makes doing this podcast thoroughly like being on a hamster wheel of terrible this at all times [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2461.2200000000003s)]
*  But that that is how democrats that's how everyone should communicate in this day and age [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2466.58s)]
*  They should over communicate should be out there all the time and [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2470.5s)]
*  That was not the approach that [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2473.78s)]
*  Joe biden used for sure [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2476.34s)]
*  Certainly not the approach that kamala harris used although she did you know exponentially more than joe biden, but you have to be [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2478.5800000000004s)]
*  we have to sort of [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2484.34s)]
*  adopt not the [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2486.34s)]
*  Messaging not the behavior but the the conceptual understanding of messaging that trump is employing here trump didn't said [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2488.1000000000004s)]
*  So much shit this week. It was easy to forget that he also [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2494.9s)]
*  Is trying to get a cabinet confirmed? [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2498.02s)]
*  uh so far the only one who's gotten through the senate who's officially confirmed as secretary of state [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2500.26s)]
*  Marco rubio [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2505.86s)]
*  Who by the way has planned a trip to panama dan [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2507.3s)]
*  So I guess that canal thing is no joke. That's gonna be his first trip as secretary of state marcos going to panama [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2511.1400000000003s)]
*  You think he's excited about that you think he's gonna be a moment on that trip where marco rubio's looks thinks of himself like [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2518.1000000000004s)]
*  How the fuck did I get here on one hand? I'm secretary of state on the other [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2523.78s)]
*  It's for donald trump and he sent me on a mission to take back the panama canal [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2528.1000000000004s)]
*  I [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2532.42s)]
*  Mean we are the world is on fire in multiple places right now and the top priority the first thing new secretary is going to do [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2535.3s)]
*  Is to go to try to take back a canal [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2543.86s)]
*  For reasons that are entirely made up made up [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2546.58s)]
*  As we went through all this podcast two days ago because he's because because donald trump is stuck in the 80s and no one wants [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2549.78s)]
*  To tell him otherwise [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2554.1s)]
*  um [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2555.38s)]
*  So that's marco dod nominee peet hegseth made it out of the armed services committee on a party line vote on monday [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2556.74s)]
*  But on tuesday the committee got a sworn statement from his former sister-in-law [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2562.18s)]
*  Detailing abusive and scary behavior toward the woman's sister hegseth's former wife [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2565.9399999999996s)]
*  Including that she once hid in a closet to get away from him and then she had to develop an escape plan [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2571.06s)]
*  Fox news reported that mitch mcconnell lisa murkowski and susan collins [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2576.74s)]
*  May all be planning to vote against hegseth in which case jd vance [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2581.22s)]
*  Would have to cast the tie-breaking vote possibly in a friday evening vote [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2585.06s)]
*  um [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2589.9399999999996s)]
*  No word on whether pam bondy or cash patelle will have any trouble getting confirmed now that trump has basically shut down the justice department's larger [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2590.8199999999997s)]
*  Largest ever investigation into right-wing domestic terrorism. That's the january 6th [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2598.58s)]
*  rioters and also suggested that he wants the government to investigate his opponents [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2603.7s)]
*  Rfk jr is apparently telling republican senators that he's changed his mind on the polio vaccine and others [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2608.66s)]
*  And that he's not trying to limit access to inoculation. So there's there's some good news for your day [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2614.1000000000004s)]
*  Some good news for your friday going to the weekend with that, uh, but apparently he'll continue to make money [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2619.0600000000004s)]
*  From his involvement in a lawsuit against murk over the hpv vaccine [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2624.34s)]
*  Which he would now be overseeing so that's lovely. Uh, he's gonna get a piece for him, too [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2628.1800000000003s)]
*  You know everyone's got their piece. Um [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2632.98s)]
*  Meanwhile one nominee who may actually be in trouble tulsi gabbert [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2635.7000000000003s)]
*  One republican senator just told semaphore quote there are very serious concerns by enough members to put her nomination in jeopardy [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2639.2200000000003s)]
*  What do you think dan is the senate going to reject any of these yahoos? Maybe tulsi gabbert? [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2647.06s)]
*  Maybe I wouldn't bet on it. Uh, but it does seem possible [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2651.3s)]
*  There was some reporting she wouldn't get out of committee [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2654.98s)]
*  Um, and they're most mad at her as it turns out for suggesting a pardon for edward snowden [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2656.9s)]
*  Which seems to be low on the list of uh reasons why she should not have this job [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2661.6200000000003s)]
*  Wow, I think they're also [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2666.9s)]
*  she's um [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2668.98s)]
*  she's not as [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2670.1800000000003s)]
*  Uh right wing on sort of surveillance issues [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2671.94s)]
*  Um, and I think they're a little some of them are a little worried about that [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2676.26s)]
*  They want they want her worried that she's gonna over or under surveil under surveil [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2679.5400000000004s)]
*  Oh can't be you can't be under surveilling in the in the trump administration [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2684.5800000000004s)]
*  The drum is going to be so you're going to be oversevailing the right people. Yeah, exactly various very against surveillance on their people [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2688.98s)]
*  Very pro surveillance on everyone else [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2694.8999999999996s)]
*  And then of course she met with asad and a couple times and they're a little concerned about that [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2698.3399999999997s)]
*  Um, so we'll see about tulsi it is wild that hegseth [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2703.94s)]
*  They can't get one more republican to take because if they have three they can't get one more republican to take down hegseth [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2707.62s)]
*  but I mean just the the drama is whether [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2712.98s)]
*  He's going to pass easily or jd vance is going to have to remind it america [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2716.8199999999997s)]
*  He exists and show up to break the tie. Yeah, that's what we're that's what we're going with [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2721.14s)]
*  So it looks like trump's going to get his cabinet and it seems like um, john thune is going to keep [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2724.58s)]
*  Uh the senate in session basically until all of the nominees are confirmed [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2729.3799999999997s)]
*  So, uh, that's what we're looking at there unsurprisingly trump's opponents have not been getting a ton of air time this week [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2734.5s)]
*  One moment that did break through though was this one from the prayer service at the national cathedral on tuesday [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2740.42s)]
*  in the name of our god [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2747.2999999999997s)]
*  I ask you [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2749.3799999999997s)]
*  To have mercy upon the people [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2751.54s)]
*  in our country [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2754.02s)]
*  We're scared now [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2755.86s)]
*  There are [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2758.98s)]
*  gay lesbian and transgender children in [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2760.5s)]
*  democratic republican and independent families [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2764.24s)]
*  Some who fear for their lives [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2768.9s)]
*  And the people [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2772.74s)]
*  the people who pick our crops [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2774.42s)]
*  And clean our office buildings who labor in poultry farms and meat packing plants [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2777.38s)]
*  Who wash the dishes after we eat in restaurants and work the night shifts in hospitals they [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2782.42s)]
*  They may not be citizens [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2788.42s)]
*  Or have the proper documentation [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2790.9s)]
*  But the vast majority of immigrants are not criminals [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2794.34s)]
*  They pay taxes [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2798.58s)]
*  And our good neighbors that of course was bishop marian buddy [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2800.34s)]
*  Um, she is the uh head bishop in washington dc of the episcopal church [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2804.98s)]
*  and um [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2810.9s)]
*  trump [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2812.9s)]
*  And the rest of the republicans spent the rest of the week attacking her for what she said not not just disagreeing [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2814.02s)]
*  Saying that it was despicable one republican congressman [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2820.66s)]
*  I don't know if it was a joke or not said that she should be on the deportation list [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2824.5s)]
*  Trump has demanded an apology from her [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2829.14s)]
*  Uh, they've called her a liar [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2832.42s)]
*  Uh, mike johnson very religious man [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2834.5s)]
*  Uh, he he posted about her that she was uh, it was despicable white house called her despicable [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2837.38s)]
*  What did you make of that moment at the prayer service? [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2842.66s)]
*  It was incredibly powerful [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2844.8199999999997s)]
*  Uh, not just what she said but the fact that she said it to trump's face particularly in an environment where [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2846.5s)]
*  So many of trump's longtime opponents are bending over backwards to kiss his ass in the most debasing way possible [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2852.8199999999997s)]
*  And so to have someone who actually is not willing just to say it but to say it to his face [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2861.0600000000004s)]
*  In a moment people are listening was powerful and courageous [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2865.7000000000003s)]
*  I also think it is [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2869.2200000000003s)]
*  a model [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2871.0600000000004s)]
*  for [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2872.5800000000004s)]
*  Other leaders to talk about trump because she like they're all saying [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2873.94s)]
*  You know, she's so division and I just looked at what mike johnson actually said her her hateful radical ideology [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2878.26s)]
*  That's what she uses an opportunity to push that [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2886.5s)]
*  And then anyone who listens to the clip like go listen to the clip go listen to the whole thing [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2889.2999999999997s)]
*  She could not have been more respectful of donald trump [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2893.7799999999997s)]
*  And republicans she could not have been more willing to extend a hand [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2898.66s)]
*  Uh, and to try to just she's just trying to lodge her [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2903.54s)]
*  Complaint in the most respectful way possible [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2908.02s)]
*  And I do think there is [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2912.18s)]
*  Additional power in [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2914.8199999999997s)]
*  Criticizing trump and criticizing what he's doing in a way where she didn't really care in that moment if [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2918.3199999999997s)]
*  Donald trump was going to get mad at her [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2924.3399999999997s)]
*  But what she was thinking about is how is this message how is what i'm saying in this criticism going to land? [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2926.18s)]
*  Even with people who may not agree with me [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2931.94s)]
*  And that's not to say that she was being like super political and thinking of message strategy like we do but she's [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2935.62s)]
*  She's clergy and she thinks about it from a human perspective and she spoke in a way [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2942.66s)]
*  That normal humans would speak to each other when you're trying to convince someone who may not agree with you [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2948.7400000000002s)]
*  In a respectful way in a way that shows grace [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2954.34s)]
*  And I think it's something and even in her interviews afterwards [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2957.2200000000003s)]
*  She had some you know all these reporters all these parties kept setting her up to like take another shot at donald trump [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2960.98s)]
*  Or really attack and she just she wouldn't do it. You know because she's like this is [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2966.9s)]
*  She said I think on a um [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2971.54s)]
*  rachel matto interviewed her [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2974.1s)]
*  and she said look I just [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2975.94s)]
*  I wanted to say it this way because I think [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2978.02s)]
*  This is a moment to try to like bring the country together and I don't think this is a moment to further inflame divisions [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2981.06s)]
*  But these voices weren't being heard and I needed to say something and I just I thought that was great [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2987.46s)]
*  you hit on I think is like the instructive part of this for democrats is [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2993.06s)]
*  Because [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=2999.0600000000004s)]
*  The core of her remarks is that she believes that despite this election despite whom we just elected [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3002.1000000000004s)]
*  That this is a country of people who? [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3008.82s)]
*  Care about each other [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3011.7000000000003s)]
*  Who want to come together and want to do the right thing? [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3013.1400000000003s)]
*  Particularly for america's most vulnerable people that we take care of each other because we take care of each other [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3016.98s)]
*  We've all been strangers here at one point and [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3021.6200000000003s)]
*  Be try to make ourselves be [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3023.7s)]
*  A lesser version of trump right sort of a paler shade of orange if you will what we want to do is we want to speak [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3026.18s)]
*  to what [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3030.9s)]
*  To the opposite of trump and that and that's what she did right and I think and I do [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3032.42s)]
*  it didn't come to fruition in this election, but [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3036.5s)]
*  I have continued to believe ever since trump first came down that escalator and won that election that the [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3039.62s)]
*  The antidote to that in the long term in politics is to get back to speaking [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3045.22s)]
*  To hope and optimism in unity and the idea that we care about each other. Yeah decency [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3049.86s)]
*  um [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3056.5s)]
*  What else have you seen? [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3057.86s)]
*  What are your overall thoughts on how democrats have responded to this to this week man? That's a loaded question [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3059.86s)]
*  Hey, man, i've been here trying to answer it all week here [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3067.46s)]
*  I'm getting asked it all the time on all these press interviews. That is that is your personal choice my friend [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3071.0600000000004s)]
*  I know you're wise to keep your head underwater there [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3075.54s)]
*  Uh, look I think to be fair to democrats it is impossible to ask them in a moment when we're in which we are thoroughly leaderless [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3079.86s)]
*  To have the fully formed response to trump in the first 72 hours of his presidency [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3087.46s)]
*  What I worry about in some of the responses to date [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3092.82s)]
*  Is that we have we are [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3097.38s)]
*  I think that we are [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3099.94s)]
*  Remain unwilling to truly reckon with this election, right? [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3102.98s)]
*  We can tell ourselves a story that the election was closer than the voters would than the sort of the narrative and that is true in one sense [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3106.9s)]
*  But it's also true and more pointed that we have bled massively with the most core parts of our coalition, right? [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3114.9s)]
*  Latino voters black voters young people and that that that is an ongoing trend, right? [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3121.86s)]
*  Over the last over the last four years [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3127.06s)]
*  and [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3129.94s)]
*  It just feels like we're doing the same people are doing the same things they were doing six months ago [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3131.14s)]
*  As opposed to really really rethinking how we communicate [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3136.58s)]
*  How we how we speak right not our message? Like how do we actually what are the words that come out of our mouth? [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3141.14s)]
*  How do we sound different? What are we going to do that's different than before? [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3145.62s)]
*  and [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3150.02s)]
*  It just and I see that I see that a little bit in the way the dnc race is playing out is that people [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3151.2999999999997s)]
*  Really? We want the easy way out what we want to do is [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3156.82s)]
*  Kind of get lucky right in that we're going to survive this period and then trump's going to be unpopular [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3161.94s)]
*  It's kind of an election. Maybe we'll we can we can win it. Um kind of like we won 2020 but that but [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3167.0600000000004s)]
*  that doesn't solve our bigger problem and I would [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3172.5s)]
*  I don't even want to depress people but [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3174.98s)]
*  Yeah, take a look at what the 2032 electoral map is going to look like and realize and once you do that you're going to realize [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3178.6600000000003s)]
*  that we have [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3184.5s)]
*  massive work to do to re to reconfigure our coalition and [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3186.02s)]
*  We have to be willing to ask really hard questions [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3190.82s)]
*  And i'm not convinced that enough people in the party want to ask those questions right now [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3193.14s)]
*  And when you say the 2032 electoral map you mean that some of the blue states could lose electoral votes because of the new [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3196.66s)]
*  Census by then because blue states are losing people to red states like you i'm still giving people [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3202.9s)]
*  Time to sort of get their sea legs [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3209.14s)]
*  In the new in the end look we had to wait to see how extreme he would be in the first week [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3212.1s)]
*  Whether he'd actually follow through. I mean, you know [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3217.54s)]
*  On this very podcast on our tuesday show. I think I was saying oh we've tried resistance politics [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3220.9s)]
*  We should try normal politics and here's the price of a like I did the whole thing and then you know, he goes and pardons [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3225.22s)]
*  these violent offenders [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3232.58s)]
*  And all the other shit and you're like you just you know, you've got to adapt [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3234.42s)]
*  To and react to him in some ways right like that that is just part of dealing with donald trump [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3238.5s)]
*  He does something and we often have to react. We try not to overreact but like that's he's the president [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3243.3s)]
*  He commands a lot of power right now, right? [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3250.1800000000003s)]
*  um, and so I you know, a lot of democrats are just finding their sea legs I get that but [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3252.7400000000002s)]
*  I have not seen anything this week, right? Like I don't [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3258.1800000000003s)]
*  You know, I saw chris murphy on the floor talking about the pardons and I think he was very passionate [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3261.78s)]
*  He's someone who who talks like a human aoc is out there. She's talking like a human [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3265.54s)]
*  um [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3272.1s)]
*  I just don't see a lot else from democrats right now with people who are just [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3273.46s)]
*  you know [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3278.9s)]
*  Putting all the polling down for a second put the stage directions down. Just tell us how you feel [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3280.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's the first week, right? [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3285.86s)]
*  You don't have to think about what polls well right now. It's the first week [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3288.42s)]
*  Tell us how you feel about this [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3292.7400000000002s)]
*  I think there's obviously a a messaging problem, but even take take the chris murphy example, right? [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3294.74s)]
*  Great speech. He lived on the floor of the senate. Yeah, right, you know, you saw that [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3299.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, because I yeah because i'm for some because I i've now made a a twitter list of democratic politicians [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3304.1s)]
*  Just so I could see what they're all talking about [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3309.9399999999996s)]
*  And that was the only one that caught my eye in that long list [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3312.8999999999996s)]
*  But and part of it is is hard other than [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3315.62s)]
*  The example they say who did a lot of her stuff on instagram live, which is the right place to do a lot of this [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3318.74s)]
*  Is there's just not people who have the capacity to be heard but part of it is you well, this is a you know [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3324.18s)]
*  this is a [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3329.94s)]
*  bigger topic about uh attention and how to command attention in this age, but [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3331.2200000000003s)]
*  Sometimes one way to get heard and have the capacity to get heard is to say something worth hearing [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3335.6s)]
*  You know, and I don't think that anyone said anything worth hearing yet or not a lot of people the bishop sure did now [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3341.78s)]
*  Look, she was in a she's a bishop. She's not political donald trump was sitting right there [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3347.3s)]
*  So obviously that's why the whole thing went viral but like [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3351.86s)]
*  I don't know. I think we gotta [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3355.2200000000003s)]
*  Start throwing some stuff against the wall see what sticks in terms of getting the message out, right? [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3357.3s)]
*  Not in terms of message itself, but like people it's what you said about trump. You gotta over [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3361.46s)]
*  Communicate right? There's the press release the senate floor speech the five-minute cable hit [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3366.96s)]
*  Not sufficient [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3373.46s)]
*  Not sufficient right now [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3374.82s)]
*  um [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3377.2200000000003s)]

*  You can be what you want to be [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3398.7400000000002s)]
*  Well, i'm not a democrat and that we know I haven't seen this enemy's list [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3401.2200000000003s)]

*  I know there was fbi agents on the ground on january 6 [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3411.8599999999997s)]
*  And then they destroyed evidence in the committee and then everybody gets preemptive pardons [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3416.3399999999997s)]
*  What's that all about? I'm just doing kind of the greatest hits of conspiracy. We do lab leak now. What do we want to go next? [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3420.58s)]
*  How'd our boy do he did great our libertarian ghost [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3427.4599999999996s)]
*  I have a I really appreciate from tommy because I have a one of my [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3433.9399999999996s)]
*  Theories i'm noodling on for the future of our party is we have to become more libertarian [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3438.26s)]
*  Okay. Yeah [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3442.82s)]
*  That's something free speech [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3444.34s)]
*  Legalized marijuana. I thought tommy did great. He was very quick on the draw [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3446.34s)]
*  I mean I did this I did jesse waters during the convention [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3450.34s)]
*  When we were uh, isn't the height of brat summer we were riding high [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3454.18s)]
*  Much yeah, he was much tougher jesse water seemed a little scared about his future. We saw you now he is [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3458.5s)]
*  Yeah, he was like well no, well tommy was like why don't you just you just want to let this go donald trump won [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3464.7400000000002s)]
*  He's like i'm not letting it go tommy vtor. Tell me that that question about how many how many genders? [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3469.46s)]
*  That was the first question to tommy. It wasn't like hey. Hello. Could you comment on the pardons? [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3474.98s)]
*  Tommy tell us about the genders [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3480.7400000000002s)]
*  Still worth and you know, I still think it's worth going on. It was worth going on to hear tommy bring up the conspiracies [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3483.94s)]
*  Give jesse some shit like I think I think it's good. I have been a long time [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3490.44s)]
*  Opponent of democrats other than the most talented of democrats, which I would include tommy and going on fox news, but now [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3497.96s)]
*  Like this is the thing we have to do we have to be everywhere and you have to be in uncomfortable spaces [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3504.92s)]
*  So you'll get more attention like if tommy had just gone on [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3509.56s)]
*  Pick your msnbc show [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3512.6s)]
*  It wouldn't have gotten any [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3515.3199999999997s)]
*  Currency outside of the people who happen to be watching at that moment [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3517.56s)]
*  For example, we're not we're not talking about love at star turn on chris hayes last night, which happened at the same time [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3521.4s)]
*  He did i'm learning this right now. I did the night before with tim miller. Yeah [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3527.7200000000003s)]

*  We're just hanging out just hanging out. Oh, we had a good time yelling about everything if I didn't know that then I gotta tell [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3535.88s)]
*  You [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3542.12s)]
*  Can't wait till your wife finds out you did that she definitely doesn't know [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3544.2s)]
*  She doesn't know she texted me she was like are you coming home and I was like no i'm doing pod and I got the view [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3549.56s)]
*  Um, no, I think I think you're right like you gotta it gets more attention that way and I think tommy did great [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3556.3599999999997s)]
*  So let's let's keep it up. All right, uh, that's all we got for news when we come back [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3561.56s)]
*  You'll all hear dan's interview with uh dnc chair candidate faz shakir [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3565.48s)]
*  But one quick thing before we do that, uh before we get to faz dan. I hear we have a special offer [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3570.2s)]
*  For our listeners for message box your substack newsletter. Is that right? Well john [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3575.56s)]
*  Great toss begin to reading the stage directions right here. It says dan crosstalk [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3582.3599999999997s)]
*  So that's what we're doing now. We're doing the crosstalk. Sometimes it says banter tk [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3587.24s)]
*  Well, well john I do have a special offer but before I get to that [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3595.3199999999997s)]
*  I just want to say i've been writing this newsletter for four and a half years now, uh, [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3597.72s)]
*  Which is very alarming but almost all that's been during the biden administration [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3601.3999999999996s)]
*  so I spent a bunch of time over the holidays trying to think about what I want to do differently now that donald trump is back in [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3605.16s)]
*  our lives [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3610.12s)]
*  and what how I want to think about with four years of fighting trump ahead of us and so [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3611.3199999999997s)]
*  It's kind of come up with like three things are going to be [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3615.72s)]
*  That i'm really going to try to focus on the first is continuing to analyze what happened this election exploring how we can rebuild our coalition [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3618.2s)]
*  we [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3624.7599999999998s)]
*  It's not pleasant to look back at that election, but we have to learn the lessons from it [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3625.64s)]
*  The second is strategizing about how we can continue to combat the right-wing media machine [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3629.72s)]
*  We got our asses absolutely kicked in the last election. We're at a huge media disadvantage [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3635.56s)]
*  So what how do we fix that as democrats? How do we communicate better? [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3639.88s)]
*  What platforms do we use what platforms we need to build? [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3643.4s)]
*  And the last thing is I want to identify for my readers specific ways [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3646.6s)]
*  We can all fight back against what trump and his minions are trying to do right and that includes [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3650.2799999999997s)]
*  Where to volunteer where to donate which campaign matters most and [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3655.2400000000002s)]
*  How to talk to the persuadable voters in your life about what's happening in politics what trump's doing how to do that the most effectively possible [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3659.2400000000002s)]
*  So this is of interest to you. I have a special offer and it cringes me to say this in so many ways [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3665.2400000000002s)]
*  But that's fun watching your face do this, right? [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3671.2400000000002s)]
*  I know [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3674.6800000000003s)]
*  Uh the special offer is if you go to the most embarrassing website possible crooked.com [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3675.48s)]

*  everyone [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3689.64s)]
*  When there is a dan pfeiffer message box [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3690.76s)]
*  It is the first thing I read when I wake up at the ungodly hour that I wake up [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3693.48s)]
*  Because i'm like i'm not going to start my day with anything else [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3698.68s)]
*  But I got to read the message box first. I do it every single time it comes out. It is a fantastic [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3702.04s)]
*  And I talk to dan all the time [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3707.32s)]

*  Oh, it's useless, especially in an age in which you've seen a lot of the power drift over to super PACs and outside [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3903.16s)]

*  What you need are people powered organizations led with integrity that say hey don't forget about us here and those [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3931.3999999999996s)]
*  Those things have to exist as institutions. So to all the people and I understand them [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3939.16s)]
*  There's a lot of working-class people out there who say [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3943.3199999999997s)]
*  Institutions are corrupt. They're broken. They don't work for me. I'm making the argument. Yeah, but [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3945.94s)]
*  Institutions are you way you need to have solidarity within a structure to have some power [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3951.56s)]
*  This is what unions are about right? This is why you and I have built up our own media [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3957.3199999999997s)]
*  Institutions is that people need voice and the DNC is one of two right major political parties in America [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3962.92s)]
*  You got the rubbican party, which we know what directions go on and the Democratic Party [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3969.3999999999996s)]
*  I'm like don't give up on a structure and an institution that has to work for people [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3973.24s)]
*  We've had the your two primary opponents for this position on the show we talked to Ken Martin and Ben Wickler [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3977.96s)]
*  What is something you disagree with them on like you you got into this race after they've been running for a long time [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3984.12s)]
*  So there must have been something you saw that was not being addressed or something you would do differently [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3988.98s)]
*  So I'm curious what the contrast is [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3992.36s)]
*  Yeah [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3993.6s)]
*  The shortcoming in my mind is that we I am very pleased and happy no surprise to you that we're not talking about being a working-class [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=3994.1s)]
*  Party, I'm like great [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4000.92s)]
*  But not in this one for a while but like I'm glad coming out of this like we're all talking about it [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4003.16s)]
*  And so then I'm sitting around saying hey, okay [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4007.6800000000003s)]
*  Give me what is the ambitious new thing that we are gonna do out of the DNC? [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4010.2000000000003s)]
*  That is going to turn the heads of working-class people to say oh, that's different. That's interesting [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4015.32s)]
*  I didn't realize you guys are gonna act that way and I quite frankly was feeling let down by the lack of [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4020.2400000000002s)]
*  Ambition on that score and you know [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4027.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm I'm jumping in to challenge the notions of our constraints of thinking around what the DNC can do if you're an [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4029.48s)]
*  Apparatus with a hundred million dollar plus and raise of a year and you've got you know, 50 plus state parties [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4037.04s)]
*  Can you think outside the box of how you let people into this? [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4042.96s)]
*  So the big thing that I'm trying to force everyone think about is a grassroots DNC that says [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4046.46s)]
*  Membership to our organization is not merely a contribution. It is us being in community with you [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4050.72s)]
*  We have to be out there with striking workers organizing workers people fighting, you know utility rate hikes or evictions and foreclosures [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4056.3s)]
*  you have to be closer to grassroots people who are fighting economic justice issues and [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4063.6600000000003s)]
*  Using your media apparatus to highlight those fights in which I think working class working class people turn to you and say well that [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4068.6600000000003s)]
*  That I've never seen from the DNC. That's interesting. That's different. That's what I'm compelling and forcing us to think about [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4075.82s)]
*  So what what is that is community that big idea that you're to talk you talk a little more about that [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4081.0600000000004s)]
*  So I blend it all together that the media infrastructure being on the front lines [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4085.72s)]
*  Let's take I mean you go case by case here [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4090.3199999999997s)]
*  but let's say Amazon workers are going to organize to fight for a union and a North Carolina warehouse, which by the way is going on and [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4092.2s)]
*  Does the DNC play a role in this right now historically you and I know we're a partisan organization [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4101.44s)]
*  We will focus on elections what I'm arguing that is that if you are working-class party you associate [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4107.0599999999995s)]
*  With the working-class struggles in all different fronts and utilize some degree of your email list to help build solidarity with them [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4113.4800000000005s)]
*  Use your media channels to advertise and explain what the hell it is that they're fighting for at this Amazon warehouse [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4122.12s)]
*  why they matter to us and [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4127.4800000000005s)]
*  Ultimately when we stick out our necks out for them in North Carolina and there's an election [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4129.88s)]
*  I believe you're more likely to get some of those people to stand with the Democratic Party up and down the ballot [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4133.58s)]
*  When the time comes so I'm seeing it more holistically that when we change the way we are projected to working-class people when we get [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4139.94s)]
*  Closer to their fights rather than just our fights [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4146.58s)]
*  I think we got a better chance to recruit them back in particularly in this moment where people [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4148.74s)]
*  Feel like Donald Trump is leading us into a world where you know wealth and power dictate all [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4152.5s)]
*  You you obviously you work for Bernie Sanders. You've been a longtime advocate. You've talked a lot about the Democratic Party becoming more populist [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4157.38s)]
*  This is a fairly loaded question or one that you could take this entire interview in several podcasts to talk about so I'll try to get your short version of the answer is [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4163.94s)]
*  You know, Joe Biden was the on economics the most progressive president in a very long time [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4170.82s)]
*  He did a lot of the things that Bernie Sanders and other [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4177.54s)]
*  Populists and progressives wanted him to do yet. We bled more with working-class voters than in any election since the 80s [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4181.14s)]
*  What why do you what is your short diagnosis for why that happened? [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4188.099999999999s)]
*  I'll try to keep it short my diagnosis is that when Joe Biden was rightly doing a lot of great populist policy [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4191.54s)]
*  It was not matched by the political apparatus [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4197.38s)]
*  Leaning into those same fights. So you take a moment where Joe Biden makes history by going to a picket line [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4200.9s)]
*  On behalf of the UAW during the midst of their strike [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4207.54s)]
*  You do not see a UA UAW kind of solidarity effort and action from the DNC saying this is our fight [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4210.18s)]
*  We together in this this was Joe Biden doing his thing [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4216.1s)]
*  Not the Democratic Party standing with you you take any of those big moments, you know [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4218.74s)]
*  If you have a Biden administration going after big pharma launching a major case going after pharmacy benefit managers going after amazon [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4221.86s)]
*  A Kroger Albertson's merger, whatever the case might be some of these big bank jump fees that that rova chopra and others were fighting [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4228.34s)]
*  You correct me if i'm wrong dan [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4236.1s)]
*  It does not feel to me that the policy apparatus that was taking on these major challenges was accompanied by [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4237.62s)]
*  A political apparatus telling you here's what we're doing and here's the friction that we are engaged in right now and why we're asking you to be part of this Democratic Party [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4245.62s)]
*  And when the political apparatus doesn't do its part [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4254.42s)]
*  We can't blame voters for just being like I had no idea and I think to this day if I went out and talked about hey [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4257.7s)]
*  Did you know we were fighting the Kroger Albertson's merger because we wanted to make sure grocery prices were low and you had competition [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4262.98s)]
*  What percentage dan what are we talking about five five percent? [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4267.78s)]
*  What a sad situation that these were the biggest you know things that that Biden was bringing about [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4271.22s)]
*  In as you know, the business world if I went into any you know [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4276.02s)]
*  K street lobbying operation or into a chamber meeting and I mentioned any of these things that you and I are just talking about would they know [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4280.18s)]
*  98 percent awareness right they were very upset [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4287.7s)]
*  Why is mark zuckerberg where he is? [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4291.06s)]
*  He was upset that you know, the Biden administration was not doing its part in the case of the Kroger Albertson [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4293.06s)]
*  where he is. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4298.98s)]
*  He was upset that, you know, [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4300.259999999999s)]
*  they're taking on his Facebook monopoly. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4301.82s)]
*  So he's upset and he moves away. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4303.9s)]
*  Elon Musk, oh, I didn't get invited [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4305.86s)]
*  to a White House meeting [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4307.48s)]
*  and Joe Biden was calling me a union buster. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4308.58s)]
*  Yeah, these rich and wealthy people [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4311.179999999999s)]
*  were very upset at this direction. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4313.62s)]
*  And yet the political apparatus is not leaning in [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4315.339999999999s)]
*  to tell you this is the direction [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4317.94s)]
*  that we are choosing to fight for working class people. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4319.98s)]
*  One of, you know, your sort of passions in politics [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4322.98s)]
*  has been sort of the asymmetry in media, right? [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4327.06s)]
*  Which is why you started more perfect union [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4330.1s)]
*  and progressive populist union, pro-union media apparatus. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4331.700000000001s)]
*  What would you do with the DNC [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4337.3s)]
*  to address the media asymmetry here? [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4339.3s)]
*  Which gets to the core, like there was a political, [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4342.54s)]
*  missing political organizing piece [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4345.46s)]
*  to what we're doing some of it, [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4347.02s)]
*  but a huge part of it is media, right? [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4347.860000000001s)]
*  We got outgunned in media. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4349.860000000001s)]
*  We were unable to communicate in the right way. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4351.080000000001s)]
*  Some of that specific to Biden, [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4352.620000000001s)]
*  but how would you change the DNC [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4354.02s)]
*  to address our media problems? [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4356.18s)]
*  Part of your job, I think in this moment [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4357.54s)]
*  is to think of yourself as editor in chief [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4359.98s)]
*  of a social media channel. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4361.98s)]
*  I feel, all right, thankfully we had more perfect union [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4365.18s)]
*  have about I'd say 1.3 million YouTube subscribers. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4367.5s)]
*  Now, Dan, I want you to guess, [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4370.66s)]
*  how many does the Democrats YouTube channel, [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4372.66s)]
*  which started in 2006, [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4376.099999999999s)]
*  how many followers does it have with more perfect union? [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4379.18s)]
*  What does POTS say now? [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4382.42s)]
*  Probably close to a million or maybe 750,000. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4383.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4385.620000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so, you know, respectable numbers here. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4386.46s)]
*  What does the DNC have? [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4388.820000000001s)]
*  150, I'm guessing. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4390.18s)]
*  76,000. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4391.820000000001s)]
*  76,000. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4393.660000000001s)]
*  So, you know, we are obviously undershooting [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4395.22s)]
*  on just utilizing the channels [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4398.58s)]
*  to do compelling and interesting content. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4400.780000000001s)]
*  But you and I know you don't just sprinkle fairy dust [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4402.780000000001s)]
*  on a YouTube channel and suddenly it grows. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4405.76s)]
*  No, you have to give some compelling content. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4408.04s)]
*  You, I don't know, do you ever work in the building? [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4410.5s)]
*  I, you know, I worked back, [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4412.22s)]
*  back in the day I was a DNC opposition researcher. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4413.900000000001s)]
*  What I do know is we're sitting on content. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4416.06s)]
*  If you wanna know what Donald Trump ever said, [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4418.38s)]
*  you know, from his first term, his campaigns video, [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4422.34s)]
*  it's there, you know, they have been recording it. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4426.14s)]
*  It's wild that, you know, [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4429.14s)]
*  that you can't come up with compelling [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4430.62s)]
*  and interesting pieces to just tell people about, [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4432.22s)]
*  here's what Donald Trump promised, here's what he said. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4435.74s)]
*  You could just, that alone could do a hell of a lot [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4438.26s)]
*  of service of content. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4440.54s)]
*  But then, as I was mentioning, [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4441.9s)]
*  when you're grassroots operation, [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4443.46s)]
*  you're getting out in the country [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4444.58s)]
*  and you're trying to tell people [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4445.74s)]
*  we're a working class organization, [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4447.259999999999s)]
*  we care and affiliate with your economic justice fights. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4448.54s)]
*  Why not use the channels, the videographers [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4451.94s)]
*  and, you know, our 50 state plus state parties to say, [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4454.86s)]
*  hey, we're gonna get on the ground [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4458.46s)]
*  and tell this interesting [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4460.339999999999s)]
*  and compelling economic justice story, [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4461.7s)]
*  just as a service to all of us [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4463.54s)]
*  to know what's going on in the housing market [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4465.82s)]
*  or how you're getting screwed on your utility rate hike, [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4469.0199999999995s)]
*  whatever the case might be, [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4473.139999999999s)]
*  I find that those types of pieces of content right now [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4475.0599999999995s)]
*  would do a hell of a lot to attract new audiences [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4478.5s)]
*  and that aren't just purely partisan, you know, in nature. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4480.78s)]
*  You know, everyone who has ever run for this job [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4485.9s)]
*  since about 2006 has talked about a 50 state strategy, [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4487.98s)]
*  we're gonna organize everywhere, [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4492.62s)]
*  we're gonna, red states, blue states, et cetera. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4494.98s)]
*  The challenge of that always is money, right? [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4497.58s)]
*  Which is, there's not enough money to do everywhere [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4500.0599999999995s)]
*  and then you ultimately feel a need to prioritize [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4503.0199999999995s)]
*  in the seven swing states or the Senate rate, [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4505.62s)]
*  the states where they have the Senate races, [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4508.46s)]
*  wherever that these days are often the same states. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4509.62s)]
*  How do you plan to address that [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4512.3s)]
*  and what's your approach to organizing all over the country? [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4514.66s)]
*  So when I, you mentioned I was at the ACLU, [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4517.34s)]
*  I faced the same thing. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4519.34s)]
*  We had 50 state affiliates all over the board. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4520.18s)]
*  We were fortunate that, you know, [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4522.38s)]
*  we had a great grassroots fundraising operation. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4523.78s)]
*  I think we ended up raising 200 million plus. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4526.1s)]
*  I think the DNC can do that this year too. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4528.42s)]
*  So I would challenge the notions that, [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4530.42s)]
*  well, we just don't have enough money. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4531.9800000000005s)]
*  I think it's a matter of conviction around that money. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4533.54s)]
*  You will, there will, it does mean if you take away [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4535.9800000000005s)]
*  from somewhere, you have to add to somewhere. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4538.5s)]
*  But if you have a conviction of saying, [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4540.18s)]
*  you know, a baseline of funding, [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4542.5s)]
*  right now you may know this, Dan, [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4543.9800000000005s)]
*  but you know, most state parties, [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4545.18s)]
*  if you're out in Idaho, wherever, [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4546.46s)]
*  you probably get $12,500 a month. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4548.3s)]
*  That's a poverty budget, right? [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4551.740000000001s)]
*  Think about trying to run a state party in Idaho [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4552.900000000001s)]
*  at $12,500 a month. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4556.26s)]
*  And so one is just, [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4558.54s)]
*  you have to increase the baseline of that. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4559.62s)]
*  And if you had a robust grassroots operation, [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4561.86s)]
*  you're not only increasing their baseline, [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4564.62s)]
*  you're also saying that the data, the donor, [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4565.94s)]
*  the lists that we're getting out of maybe even [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4568.78s)]
*  the last election cycle, we've raised a billion dollars [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4571.42s)]
*  from, you know, small dollar funds, [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4573.42s)]
*  that that list goes back over to you as well. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4575.22s)]
*  You've now got it, but you got to know what to do with it. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4578.0599999999995s)]
*  This is a challenge I face at the ACLU. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4580.099999999999s)]
*  So I give you the list. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4582.0199999999995s)]
*  Do you have the digital expertise? [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4583.34s)]
*  Do you know how to do online to offline events [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4585.820000000001s)]
*  with volunteers? [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4588.1s)]
*  Probably it might be challenging for a lot of other states. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4589.22s)]
*  That's where DNC comes in to say, [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4592.22s)]
*  hey, I got to give you some baselines. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4593.820000000001s)]
*  Not only am I increasing the amount to the state, [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4596.38s)]
*  I also got to give you technical expertise [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4599.3s)]
*  from national of how to use it, the know-how. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4601.34s)]
*  And then I would just say our job, [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4604.54s)]
*  and I'll say this all delicacy in respect [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4606.900000000001s)]
*  to the DNC universe, which I've been in, [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4609.26s)]
*  and you know a little bit about lots of councils [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4611.5s)]
*  and lots of caucuses. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4613.74s)]
*  Man, one council and one caucus breeds [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4614.74s)]
*  another council and a caucus. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4616.62s)]
*  What we really need is like program admission. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4618.3s)]
*  And so this is by example, what I did at ACLU is say, [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4621.58s)]
*  hey, we got one program mission for us was expand voting [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4625.42s)]
*  rights in this country. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4628.66s)]
*  Here's a North star. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4629.58s)]
*  Now states, pitch me on what you could do [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4630.66s)]
*  to expand voting rights. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4634.34s)]
*  You got independent redistricting commissions, [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4635.38s)]
*  you got expansion of early vote, [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4637.179999999999s)]
*  you're trying to get formerly incarcerated individuals [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4638.42s)]
*  to vote. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4640.179999999999s)]
*  Great, get me a pitch, explain what's going on in your state [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4641.0199999999995s)]
*  and what you need to help fund it. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4643.86s)]
*  See, so if you set like a goal and ambition, [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4645.46s)]
*  a purpose at the top, and now you got states saying, [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4647.9s)]
*  I think here, even in Idaho, [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4650.94s)]
*  I think we can do something about that. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4652.78s)]
*  We need that. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4654.94s)]
*  So goals, ambitions are like grassroots organizing is one, [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4655.86s)]
*  out in events and communities that I was mentioning before. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4659.38s)]
*  Candidate recruitment, cross-border, [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4662.179999999999s)]
*  tell me what you're doing to expand [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4663.66s)]
*  and do interesting candidate recruitment, [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4664.98s)]
*  and we'll fund it. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4666.62s)]
*  And you know, so I just feel a lack of ambition around, [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4667.66s)]
*  where's program admission here? [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4671.62s)]
*  Can you raise that money while still being less annoying [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4673.9400000000005s)]
*  in your texts and emails than the Democratic Party [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4676.22s)]
*  has been in a long time? [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4678.34s)]
*  You know, one of the learnings of Bernie's email list, [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4679.66s)]
*  which still to this day is very vibrant [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4682.1s)]
*  and raises a fair amount [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4683.9800000000005s)]
*  and probably outperforms a number of candidates [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4685.02s)]
*  still running for office is that, [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4686.7s)]
*  and I don't know if you're on the emails, [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4688.900000000001s)]
*  he writes very substantive, long emails [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4690.9400000000005s)]
*  and asks people often not even for direct contribution, [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4693.5s)]
*  it's a petition action and a secondary asks for money. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4695.86s)]
*  And I think, I don't wanna treat people [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4698.66s)]
*  like they're dumb. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4703.1s)]
*  I do think people, particularly in this age [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4704.22s)]
*  where the economy is complex, people know it's rigged, [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4706.34s)]
*  they're seeking depth. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4709.1s)]
*  Get me into understanding, own your leader, your job, [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4711.34s)]
*  help unpack stuff for me. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4715.18s)]
*  And I believe the emails, lists and texts [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4717.700000000001s)]
*  don't have to be superficial [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4720.700000000001s)]
*  and treat people like they're dumb. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4722.5s)]
*  I think you can raise the bar and you say, [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4723.780000000001s)]
*  hey, this is something interesting and compelling [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4725.700000000001s)]
*  that I want you to know about [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4727.9400000000005s)]
*  and I'm asking you to fund it. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4728.780000000001s)]
*  I think we'd see an increase in funding, [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4730.38s)]
*  not a drop off. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4732.58s)]
*  Would the DNC under your leadership [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4733.94s)]
*  accept from corporate PACs and lobbyists? [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4736.18s)]
*  So what I'm, yes, well, what I'm most upset about there [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4738.34s)]
*  is that corporate power influence over the party. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4741.18s)]
*  So I wouldn't accept money from PACs lobbyists [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4744.58s)]
*  who are trying to say, hey, we wanna seat at the table, [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4747.94s)]
*  we're gonna influence this. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4750.9s)]
*  And right now I think that that's what you got going, Dan, [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4751.9s)]
*  is you've got these folks who believe not, [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4754.0199999999995s)]
*  that when I give you a contribution, [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4756.22s)]
*  I expect that my finance committee [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4758.860000000001s)]
*  will now not be run by finance people [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4763.42s)]
*  that are the delegates or people [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4766.62s)]
*  who we brought into the DNC, but they're outsiders. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4768.62s)]
*  The people outside the organization, they come in, [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4771.38s)]
*  they make determinations. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4773.02s)]
*  So I think if you're a working class party, [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4774.820000000001s)]
*  in my view, you do things that stand [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4777.62s)]
*  for working class people. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4780.54s)]
*  And I'll do a twist on you on this one. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4782.1s)]
*  If Amazon wanted to give me, [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4785.18s)]
*  I was wrestling with this in real time, [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4787.94s)]
*  if Amazon wanted to give me $50,000 for the DNC, [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4789.18s)]
*  promise you, you're marked to support Amazon workers [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4793.26s)]
*  in this country. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4796.42s)]
*  So I'll take it, and guess what? [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4797.26s)]
*  Those Amazon workers who are organizing in North Carolina, [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4798.94s)]
*  they're gonna get every penny. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4801.78s)]
*  We're gonna show you, if you're a working class party, [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4803.14s)]
*  this is what you are supporting. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4805.78s)]
*  And in that way, yes, I will show my true colors [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4808.0199999999995s)]
*  because corporate influence will not have driven [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4811.78s)]
*  the decision-making. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4815.099999999999s)]
*  And I think that my sense is there's a lack of transparency [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4816.7s)]
*  and people feel like corporate influence [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4819.78s)]
*  is having a large role in it [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4821.34s)]
*  because we don't even know where the hell the money's going. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4822.58s)]
*  Where does all the large numbers amounts? [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4824.58s)]
*  Because on the FEC filings, [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4827.0199999999995s)]
*  there's consultants who get money, [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4828.78s)]
*  but what I don't see anything, where is my value? [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4830.139999999999s)]
*  As a member of the Democratic Party, [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4833.78s)]
*  what are you doing in community with me? [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4835.139999999999s)]
*  You can raise the bar on that one. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4837.0599999999995s)]
*  We can do compelling and interesting stuff [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4838.0599999999995s)]
*  in communities all over the country. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4839.54s)]
*  Well, Faz, thanks so much for joining us. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4841.3s)]

*  with none other than Rachel Maddow [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4855.38s)]
*  about Trump's first week back in office, [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4857.18s)]
*  how we should cover his second term and how to stay sane. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpvVghlcp0g&t=4858.780000000001s)]
