Video Description: The Supreme Court hits pause on Alien Enemies Act deportations—for now—and some MAGA diehards advocate for Trump to simply ignore the court. Pete Hegseth stars in the Signalgate sequel, reportedly using his personal phone to share top secret information with his wife, brother, and lawyer—with more bombshell reports to come, according to a former Pentagon spokesman. Jon, Lovett, and Tommy discuss the latest on Trump's deportation agenda, whether Hegseth's days as Defense Secretary are numbered, the accidental email that reportedly set off the Trump administration's war with Harvard, and the untimely passing of Pope Francis. @strictscrutinypodcast's Leah Litman joins Lovett to break down the Supreme Court's emergency order and the administration's efforts to evade the rule of law.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# MAGA Melts Down After Supreme Court Rules Against Extreme Trump Policy
**Pod Save America:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA)
*  That clip of Hex F was so unconvincing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=0.0s)]
*  He's like shouting at a C-Span camera. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3.2s)]
*  He's pointing to his own children, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=5.0s)]
*  kind of like using them as a shield [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=6.44s)]
*  for the media in that moment. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=8.6s)]
*  And he just had the look and the feel of a man [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=10.08s)]
*  who was in so far over his head [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=13.16s)]
*  and he does not know how to get out of it. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  That's very real housewives, by the way. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=16.72s)]
*  As a friend, Pete, I'm telling you, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=18.12s)]
*  you're a piece of s***. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=19.84s)]
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  I'm Jon Favreau. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=22.16s)]
*  I'm Jon Lovett. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=23.0s)]
*  I'm Tommy Vitor. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=23.84s)]
*  On today's show, we're gonna cover the Supreme Court [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=24.68s)]
*  stopping alien enemy act deportations for now. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  And bring in strict scrutiny's Leah Lippman [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=29.76s)]
*  to tell us what it all means. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=31.720000000000002s)]
*  We'll also talk about Pete Hegseth's [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  second signal chat scandal [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=35.04s)]
*  and the mutiny against him from within the Pentagon. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=36.88s)]
*  How the White House started its war with Harvard by mistake [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  and the passing of Pope Francis, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=42.88s)]
*  who held on just long enough to dunk on JD Vance. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=44.24s)]
*  But let's start with the biggest news from the weekend, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=48.32s)]
*  which is that the Supreme Court has inched even closer [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=50.0s)]
*  to a full blown confrontation with the Trump administration [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=52.64s)]
*  over their use of the Alien Enemies Act [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=56.24s)]
*  to deprive people of any due process [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=58.64s)]
*  before disappearing them to prison in El Salvador. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=61.0s)]
*  The court issued a highly unusual emergency ruling [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=63.72s)]
*  in the middle of the night [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=66.76s)]
*  that specifically ordered the administration [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  to halt their plans to deport a group of Venezuelans, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=69.72s)]
*  at least temporarily. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=72.28s)]
*  Only Justices Thomas and Alito dissented. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=73.6s)]
*  In just a bit, you're gonna hear Lovett's quick interview [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=76.48s)]
*  with our pal Leah Lippman from strict scrutiny [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=78.4s)]
*  about what the ruling means and what's next. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  Before we get to that, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=82.4s)]
*  three of us haven't had a chance to talk [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=84.08s)]
*  since Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=85.64s)]
*  returned from El Salvador [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=88.6s)]
*  after his last minute surprise meeting [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=89.91999999999999s)]
*  with Kilmire Obrego Garcia, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=92.55999999999999s)]
*  who had been transferred out of Seacat to a new prison. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=94.52s)]
*  Bukele and the Trump White House, of course, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=97.39999999999999s)]
*  attacked Van Hollen for meeting with Obrego Garcia. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=98.91999999999999s)]
*  Salvadoran officials even placed two fake margaritas [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=102.64s)]
*  in front of them to make it seem like [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=106.39999999999999s)]
*  everyone's having a good time down there. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=108.39999999999999s)]
*  When Van Hollen returned home- [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=111.16s)]
*  Two margaritas, I'm gonna open the jail, all right. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=112.47999999999999s)]
*  Huh? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=115.88000000000001s)]
*  You got one laugh and a lot of stunned faces. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=117.84s)]
*  I don't know that song. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  It's okay. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=121.28s)]
*  I thought we'd go with like a wasting away in Margaritaville. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=122.12s)]
*  No? Nope. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=124.84s)]
*  No? Okay. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=125.68s)]
*  When Van Hollen returned home, he did all the Sunday shows. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=127.04s)]
*  Here he is patiently answering questions [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=129.64000000000001s)]
*  from Fox News anchor Shannon Breen [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=132.20000000000002s)]
*  that might have caused me to burst a blood vessel. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=133.96s)]
*  Did you ask him if he has any association with MS-13? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=136.48000000000002s)]
*  I didn't ask him directly [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=139.84s)]
*  because he's answered that question repeatedly [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=141.0s)]
*  as his lawyers have. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=143.12s)]
*  My purpose in going there was to, number one, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=144.16s)]
*  see if he was alive, see if he was healthy, take his story. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=147.4s)]
*  Do you worry, though, that you are sticking your neck out [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=152.0s)]
*  for somebody who maybe down the line [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=154.36s)]
*  is proven to be connected to MS-13? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=155.88s)]
*  I wanna be very clear. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=158.0s)]
*  I'm not vouching for the man. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  I'm vouching for the man's rights. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=161.8s)]
*  Who did pay for this trip? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=164.44s)]
*  This was an officially cleared congressional trip, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=166.76s)]
*  cleared on a five-partisan basis. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=170.36s)]
*  Yes, like every other trip, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=172.64s)]
*  like the trip Kristi Noem took [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=174.04s)]
*  with her fashion show before CICOT. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=176.4s)]
*  Nice. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=178.51999999999998s)]
*  Also, two Republican congressmen now. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  We paid for Kilmar Obrego Garcia's trip, too. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=181.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, $6 million a year. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=184.12s)]
*  In lodging, so shut up. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=186.56s)]
*  So shut up. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=189.56s)]
*  It was really hard to watch the whole interview. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=190.4s)]
*  Very frustrating. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=192.88s)]
*  Chris Van Hollen, patience of a saint there. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=193.72s)]
*  He's doing a good job. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=195.32s)]
*  You guys have reactions to the meeting and the aftermath. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=196.84s)]
*  The Trump folks seem to think this is a winning issue [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  for them, and that people will believe [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=201.84s)]
*  that the story is about Democrats trying to bring [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=203.56s)]
*  an MS-13 foreign terrorist back home. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=205.32s)]
*  I think Van Hollen did a good job [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=207.72s)]
*  of making it about bigger principles. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=209.52s)]
*  He did exactly what I want Democrats to do in this moment, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=211.08s)]
*  which is he stepped up, he flew down to El Salvador, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=213.16s)]
*  he took personal political risk, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=215.6s)]
*  knowing Bukele would try to humiliate him, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  which he did with this. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=219.6s)]
*  It wasn't even a good margarita stunt. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=220.44s)]
*  It was like a cherry or something. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=222.88s)]
*  No one's drinking margaritas with cherries. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=225.12s)]
*  What are you doing, dude? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=227.04s)]
*  Yeah, I was in a water glass. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=228.08s)]
*  It was strange. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=230.08s)]
*  It was foolish. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=230.92000000000002s)]
*  He knew, obviously, that Republicans would attack him [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=232.6s)]
*  as a fan of gang members, and sure enough, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=234.72s)]
*  the White House photoshopped a photo of Van Hollen [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=236.67999999999998s)]
*  with gang tattoos all over his face and stuff, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=239.95999999999998s)]
*  so it was just childish nonsense. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=242.0s)]
*  But Van Hollen used what little leverage he had [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=243.23999999999998s)]
*  as US Senator to get the only results we've seen [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=245.64s)]
*  outside of a courtroom, which was to get access [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=249.12s)]
*  to Ibrigo Garcia. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=251.76s)]
*  I also think he's someone who's shown a lot of courage [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=253.92s)]
*  on a bunch of issues lately, on Gaza, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=257.96s)]
*  a whole bunch of other, a host of other things. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=259.88s)]
*  I think that's what we want from someone like him [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=262.12s)]
*  in a safe seat like Maryland to do, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=264.36s)]
*  put your neck out there. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=267.12s)]
*  You guys have any thoughts on why Bukele [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=268.48s)]
*  allowed the visit last minute? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=272.36s)]
*  These are all educated guesses, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=274.72s)]
*  because we don't know for sure. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=276.24s)]
*  There was a not at all veiled threat [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=277.64s)]
*  that not allowing that access was a violation [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=279.2s)]
*  of international law and could lead to cuts [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=282.84s)]
*  to future US assistance. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=285.24s)]
*  Right, except it would have to be cuts [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=286.76s)]
*  to future US assistance under a different regime. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=288.84s)]
*  I was surprised that he got the meeting, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=291.52s)]
*  because it's like he's bending to pressure. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=293.44s)]
*  Van Hollen was staying to try to get the meeting. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=295.11999999999995s)]
*  It all feels very, I think even the margaritas point to [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=299.64s)]
*  Trump and Bukele are doing this on the fly [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=303.35999999999996s)]
*  and figuring out what they're doing on the fly. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=305.71999999999997s)]
*  What is the message that putting two margaritas, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=307.4s)]
*  it's so fucking stupid. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=309.76s)]
*  But the whole point of CICOT is that it's a fucking hell hole [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=311.35999999999996s)]
*  that you brag about. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=314.32s)]
*  The reason Kristi Noem and these members of Congress [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=315.23999999999995s)]
*  took tourist photos in front of these prisoners [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=318.68s)]
*  is to send a message about how fucking terrible it is. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=320.76s)]
*  So what exactly is the point of the margaritas? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=323.12s)]
*  It's not terrible, he's actually on a vacation down there. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=325.16s)]
*  I thought that's the opposite. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=327.64s)]
*  He's just a troll, that's the point. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=328.48s)]
*  He likes to troll the left. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=330.32s)]
*  He's on Twitter all the time, he's super online. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=331.44s)]
*  So he's saying, oh, you're calling me a despid [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=333.48s)]
*  and a dictator and that we're torturing this man. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=336.8s)]
*  Here he is having a margarita. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=338.6s)]
*  Yeah, he has risen, he made some jokes. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=339.84000000000003s)]
*  Here he is enjoying a margarita. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=342.72s)]
*  His Twitter bio used to say, world's coolest dictator. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=344.84000000000003s)]
*  He just loves to be a troll like this. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=347.24s)]
*  Right, so then the meeting is a troll [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=348.88s)]
*  showing that he's fine, that's why the margaritas are there. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=350.76s)]
*  You know what? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=353.52s)]
*  It doesn't need to make sense. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=354.36s)]
*  Yeah, you can't think about it too much. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=355.2s)]
*  Well, that's my point, like why did he get the meeting? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=356.32s)]
*  I'm just like all of right-wing politics right now. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=357.16s)]
*  Right, it's just fascist jazz and they were just, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=358.96000000000004s)]
*  they thought, oh, let's give him the meeting, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=361.72s)]
*  we'll make a joke at it, we'll show that he's fine, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=363.48s)]
*  we'll turn it to our advantage. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=365.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's bukele. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=366.28000000000003s)]
*  And then I think the Trump White House is just like, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=367.24s)]
*  they're going all in on the message, Democrats love MS-13. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=369.0s)]
*  No other facts can penetrate this message. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=371.92s)]
*  The idea that we just want people to have due process, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=374.92s)]
*  that the Trump administration already admitted in court [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=377.76s)]
*  multiple times that they made an error, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=380.08s)]
*  that they don't know, they haven't given any justification [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=383.24s)]
*  for why we're jailing people in a foreign prison, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=386.12s)]
*  perhaps for the rest of their lives. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=388.92s)]
*  None of that matters at all. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=390.68s)]
*  Also, they can't, I mean, we'll get to it, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=392.24s)]
*  but they also just have to either did like kind of [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=393.56s)]
*  quickly glide over or outright ignore the fact [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=396.48s)]
*  that these aren't just Democrats expressing these concerns, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=398.92s)]
*  it's Reagan appointees, it's three Trump appointees [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=401.38s)]
*  to the Supreme Court, yeah. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=404.56s)]
*  And also just want to point out that another story [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=406.88s)]
*  that was I think broke late last week. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=409.44s)]
*  So Trump invoking the Alien Enemies Act requires him [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=411.48s)]
*  to claim that Tren de Aragua is invading the US [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=415.96s)]
*  at the behest of the Maduro regime in Venezuela. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=419.28000000000003s)]
*  Most legal experts believe like that kind of linkage [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=422.8s)]
*  is necessary for a Alien Enemies Act declaration. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=425.64s)]
*  Both the New York Times and the Washington Post [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=429.24s)]
*  reported that the National Intelligence Council, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=431.12s)]
*  which is like the board that brings together [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=433.92s)]
*  the consensus opinion of the 18 component intelligence [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=436.72s)]
*  agencies have determined that the Venezuelan government [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=439.76s)]
*  does not, they're not directing Tren de Aragua, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=442.36s)]
*  they're not directing an invasion of the United States. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=445.2s)]
*  So that undercuts Trump's public statements [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=447.56s)]
*  and the already shaky legal basis [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=449.68s)]
*  for the entire Alien Enemies Act invocation. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=451.64s)]
*  Yeah, and a reminder, the Supreme Court has not ruled [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=454.44s)]
*  on the constitutionality of Trump invoking [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=456.44s)]
*  the Alien Enemies Act, so that could come back [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=459.04s)]
*  to bite them in the ass. Yes. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=460.72s)]
*  And again, there's no legal justification [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=462.48s)]
*  and nothing in the Alien Enemies Act that says, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=465.56s)]
*  oh yeah, you also are able to, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=468.64000000000004s)]
*  you're not just able to deport people [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=470.6s)]
*  under the Alien Enemies Act, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=471.84000000000003s)]
*  you're able to send them to a foreign prison [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=472.88s)]
*  and pay a foreign country to jail them. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=475.28000000000003s)]
*  There's no justification for that anywhere. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=477.64000000000004s)]
*  As a judge in the appeals court noted, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=479.76s)]
*  Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=482.92s)]
*  But just your question on the politics, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=485.36s)]
*  right now, Democrats are supposed to be doing [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=486.88s)]
*  some kind of cost of living week [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=489.56s)]
*  or something to that effect. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=491.8s)]
*  It's cost of living action week. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=492.64s)]
*  Cost of living action, no, cost. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=494.08s)]
*  Action, cost of, we're doing, we're taking on. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=497.08s)]
*  COLA? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=499.16s)]
*  I'm not sure what it is. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=500.6s)]
*  I don't think it's the COLA plan. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=501.44s)]
*  No, it's a COLA plan. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=502.28000000000003s)]
*  Now, dear listener, you won't know this existed [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=503.6s)]
*  because you didn't get the briefing on all the news [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=506.36s)]
*  that you get when you work on Pod Save America [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=508.68s)]
*  because it's not gonna break through [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=510.36s)]
*  because this is what the news is. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=511.48s)]
*  And I was thinking about our conversation [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=513.4s)]
*  with Sarah McBride and the way in which Democrats [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=515.6s)]
*  have kind of allowed themselves or boxed themselves in [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=519.36s)]
*  on immigration over the years to the point where [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=522.08s)]
*  you're not supposed to be talking about due process, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=524.32s)]
*  but also you're not supposed to be talking about [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=526.28s)]
*  border security, right? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=528.6s)]
*  Like all of these were sort of unacceptable [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=529.64s)]
*  as the bounds of what we were allowed to discuss [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=531.44s)]
*  got smaller and smaller. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=533.24s)]
*  And there's this sort of consultant-driven, poll-driven, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=535.0s)]
*  best-sentence message testing idea [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=541.6800000000001s)]
*  that what you really need to be doing [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=544.5600000000001s)]
*  is figuring out the message that works [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=546.24s)]
*  with the broadest group of people, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=547.88s)]
*  but also you should be using that message all the time. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=550.12s)]
*  So you need to be trying to win everybody over [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=552.72s)]
*  a little bit all the time, which in an environment [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=555.2s)]
*  like this means, for the most part, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=557.8s)]
*  winning nobody over all the time. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=559.4s)]
*  Even issue like this, a lot of people [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=561.84s)]
*  may not be following it closely. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=564.76s)]
*  It probably isn't the most important issue [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=566.24s)]
*  for the vast majority of people [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=568.08s)]
*  that voted in the presidential election. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=570.04s)]
*  Maybe more people who voted in a midterm might care about this, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=571.96s)]
*  but there are millions of people that are highly engaged [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=574.92s)]
*  that do care about this a lot. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=576.92s)]
*  And if you're just being cynical, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=578.0799999999999s)]
*  if you're just being crass, you can spend every day [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=579.16s)]
*  talking about the economy in the hopes [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=582.88s)]
*  of persuading everybody a little bit inch by inch [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=585.52s)]
*  until the midterms, I guess, even though we have no idea [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=588.8s)]
*  what the contours of that debate will look like [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=591.88s)]
*  two years from now. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=593.76s)]
*  And I'm sure in October of next year, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=594.5999999999999s)]
*  we'll be talking about the economy constantly, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=596.04s)]
*  the who knows what the main debate will be about. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=598.4399999999999s)]
*  But right now, this is the most important way [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=601.0799999999999s)]
*  we can respond to the Trump administration. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=604.5999999999999s)]
*  There are millions of people who want to believe [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=606.24s)]
*  Democrats are credible agents on their behalf. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=608.72s)]
*  And you have an opportunity to build that credibility [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=612.48s)]
*  with people that are desperate for people [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=614.5600000000001s)]
*  to show some leadership, to show that they understand [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=616.48s)]
*  and really mean it when they say Trump [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=620.36s)]
*  is a threat to democracy. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=622.0400000000001s)]
*  And so, yes, I get that they're, you know, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=623.5600000000001s)]
*  you guys talked about it Friday news, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=626.84s)]
*  some saying it's a distraction, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=628.12s)]
*  and there are people that think we should only be focused [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=629.6800000000001s)]
*  on tariffs in the economy. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=631.0s)]
*  But right now, you can build a lot of trust [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=633.4000000000001s)]
*  with a group of people that will be your [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=636.48s)]
*  most important messengers a year from now. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=639.96s)]
*  And just on cynical terms, I think that that's worth it. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=642.2s)]
*  Well, I mean, this is not a politically unpopular [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=645.08s)]
*  but courageous and morally right thing to do. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=647.96s)]
*  It's also politically popular. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=650.2800000000001s)]
*  Like, all the polling that's coming out so far [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=651.5200000000001s)]
*  is very clear that most people think [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=654.5600000000001s)]
*  we should not send people to a foreign prison [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=657.2800000000001s)]
*  without a trial. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=659.44s)]
*  I have not seen a single poll yet [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=661.4s)]
*  that has argued otherwise. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=663.4399999999999s)]
*  There are some polls that people are saying, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=665.04s)]
*  oh, well, Trump's overall favorability on immigration [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=666.36s)]
*  is still the strongest issue. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=669.84s)]
*  Yes, when you just scratch one inch beneath that surface, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=670.84s)]
*  all the polling says otherwise. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=674.6s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's true. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=675.88s)]
*  But look- [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=677.36s)]
*  But I'm saying that's important [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=678.64s)]
*  because that's why these consultants, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=679.76s)]
*  the consultant brain is especially dumb on this one. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=681.88s)]
*  It's like trying to figure out why Bukele [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=684.0s)]
*  put the margaritas on the table. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=685.4s)]
*  Yeah, I think the more generous argument [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=686.72s)]
*  is to say, sure, sure, but over time, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=690.2s)]
*  you're creating the impression that you're soft. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=692.6800000000001s)]
*  I don't agree with this. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=694.48s)]
*  I'm just saying, over time, if Democrats pick this fight, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=695.32s)]
*  what is your memory of this fight? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=697.88s)]
*  It is not Democrats fighting for border security [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=699.08s)]
*  or fighting to lower costs. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=701.24s)]
*  It's Democrats fighting for a more generous [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=703.0s)]
*  immigration system and fighting for an undocumented [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=705.36s)]
*  or a legal immigrant to apply for asylum, what have you. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=708.6400000000001s)]
*  I don't agree with that argument, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=711.96s)]
*  but we're making this salient for people. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=713.4000000000001s)]
*  And I think that is still worth doing [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=715.9200000000001s)]
*  because I think years of trying to build [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=717.64s)]
*  a little bit of credibility with everyone all the time [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=720.24s)]
*  has left us with a lack of credibility [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=722.4s)]
*  with just about everyone. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=724.6s)]
*  So apparently the list of MS-13 Trendy Aragon enthusiasts [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=725.88s)]
*  has grown to now include John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=730.0400000000001s)]
*  Amy Coney Barrett, Neil Gorsuch, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=732.9200000000001s)]
*  who joined the liberal justices [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=734.8000000000001s)]
*  in a late night emergency ruling over the weekend [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=736.0400000000001s)]
*  that blocked the deportation of a group of Venezuelans [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=738.8000000000001s)]
*  in North Texas under the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=741.0s)]
*  The court ruled so quickly [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=743.76s)]
*  that the lower courts hadn't yet ruled. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=745.4s)]
*  The justice department hadn't yet responded to the challenge [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=747.0s)]
*  and Sam Alito hadn't yet finished his dissent, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=749.84s)]
*  which is very rare that the court releases an opinion [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=753.2800000000001s)]
*  without the dissent if the dissent is still being written. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=756.72s)]
*  Were you guys surprised these geezers work so late? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=759.36s)]
*  I assume they're alerted, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=763.2s)]
*  but then their clerks do most of the work. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=765.24s)]
*  Yeah, I think it was the- [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=767.24s)]
*  It's a good question for our strict scrutiny. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=768.88s)]
*  Yeah, we talked about what it meant [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=770.84s)]
*  that Alito hadn't yet dotted his T's [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=772.88s)]
*  and crossed his eyes when it went out with Leah. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=776.28s)]
*  Well, the important point here is that the government claimed [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=778.68s)]
*  or tried to claim that it didn't have any imminent plans [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=782.8399999999999s)]
*  to deport the immigrants and the court's ruling [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=786.3199999999999s)]
*  when it came as fast as it came, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=790.04s)]
*  showed that clearly they do not believe them. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=792.12s)]
*  At least the seven justices [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=794.28s)]
*  were not willing to trust the government [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=796.1999999999999s)]
*  and take their word for it. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=798.3199999999999s)]
*  Wild stuff and also a bit complicated. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=799.24s)]
*  So love to talk to Leah about this ruling [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=800.68s)]
*  and Judge Boesberg's contempt finding. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=802.8399999999999s)]
*  Here's the interview with Leah. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=804.88s)]
*  Joining us now, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=805.9599999999999s)]
*  Professor of Law at the University of Michigan, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=806.8s)]
*  co-host of Strict Scrutiny, Zingerman's Delia Ficcianato, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=808.8s)]
*  and the author of the upcoming book, Lawless, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=812.04s)]
*  How the Supreme Court Runs on Conservative Grievance, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=814.7199999999999s)]
*  Fringe Theories, and Bad Vibes, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=817.3199999999999s)]
*  available for pre-order now, out May 13th. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=819.36s)]
*  Leah Libman, welcome back. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=822.92s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=824.4799999999999s)]
*  I wanna just say, Leah, that I am at an advantage [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=825.36s)]
*  because I've already read the book. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=828.64s)]
*  So you know everything. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=830.16s)]
*  Why even have me on? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=831.4s)]
*  I have been prepared. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=832.56s)]
*  Well, you know, a book can do many things, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=833.64s)]
*  but it can't keep up with the daily news cycle. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=835.84s)]
*  But it does prepare you for this moment. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=838.5600000000001s)]
*  So I really do urge everyone listening to this [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=840.1600000000001s)]
*  to pause this podcast and put in a pre-order. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=843.64s)]
*  Let's get this thing on the bestseller list. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=846.6800000000001s)]
*  That's one thing we can do to fight back against the, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=850.6800000000001s)]
*  you know. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=855.48s)]
*  It will make Sam Alito very mad [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=856.32s)]
*  if this makes it bestseller list. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=857.96s)]
*  And he keeps up with his Google alerts. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=859.52s)]
*  Oh yeah, he hates reads the internet. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=861.48s)]
*  So a lot of developments over the last few days, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=863.36s)]
*  there was an extraordinary ruling by Judge Harvey Wilkinson [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=865.56s)]
*  in the Abrego Garcia case on Thursday. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=868.1999999999999s)]
*  On Friday, an appeals court paused. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=870.4s)]
*  Judge James Boasberg's plan to begin contempt proceedings [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=872.4399999999999s)]
*  against the Trump administration over their failure [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=875.16s)]
*  to turn around deportation flights to El Salvador. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=877.56s)]
*  And then on Saturday in a 7-2 ruling, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=880.56s)]
*  the Supreme Court temporarily blocked the deportations [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=882.68s)]
*  of any Venezuelans held in Northern Texas [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=884.96s)]
*  under the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=887.48s)]
*  Judge Samuel Alito issued a pissy little dissent [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=889.52s)]
*  to which Justice Clarence Thomas joined. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=892.64s)]
*  Let's take each piece of this. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=895.64s)]
*  First of all, what is the status [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=897.1999999999999s)]
*  of the Boasberg contempt proceedings? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=899.72s)]
*  That is on hold because the two to one DC circuit panel, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=902.64s)]
*  two Trump appointees in the majority [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=906.08s)]
*  paused the contempt order, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=908.16s)]
*  which basically prevents Judge Boasberg from moving forward. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=909.72s)]
*  And he had asked the government to submit declarations [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=913.0s)]
*  or to purge their contempt by bringing back everyone [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=915.36s)]
*  from the El Salvadoran prison [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=918.16s)]
*  that the government had wrongfully sent there. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=919.8s)]
*  So that is just on hold until further action [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=922.2s)]
*  by the DC circuit. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=924.6400000000001s)]
*  There are so many strange [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=925.9200000000001s)]
*  and extraordinary things happening. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=927.72s)]
*  On the list of obviously it's not high on our list [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=930.6400000000001s)]
*  because of what else is happening, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=932.72s)]
*  but this is a strange order, right? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=933.9200000000001s)]
*  Because Boasberg didn't hold anybody in contempt. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=935.88s)]
*  He was just beginning the process [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=938.4000000000001s)]
*  to try to gather information. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=940.0s)]
*  It is, as we say on strict scrutiny, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=941.8000000000001s)]
*  just total fuck shit, right? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=943.36s)]
*  Like you are not ordinarily supposed to be able [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=944.6400000000001s)]
*  to appeal a ruling that does nothing, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=947.4000000000001s)]
*  that is not final, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=949.92s)]
*  that leaves additional things to be determined. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=950.9599999999999s)]
*  And Judge Boasberg, as you note, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=953.1999999999999s)]
*  didn't hold anyone in contempt. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=955.0799999999999s)]
*  And he held out the possibility [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=956.68s)]
*  that he would never hold anyone in contempt [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=957.88s)]
*  so long as the government returned people from El Salvador. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=960.0s)]
*  So I don't know what the F, the DC circuit panel, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=962.64s)]
*  thought that they were pausing, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=965.76s)]
*  but obviously the prospect [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=967.0s)]
*  of holding the Trump administration accountable [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=968.3199999999999s)]
*  under the law was just too galling for them to note. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=970.8s)]
*  And they had to take a pause over that one. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=973.3199999999999s)]
*  So as you've noted on strict, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=975.48s)]
*  Trump has a lot of power here. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=978.76s)]
*  First of all, Boasberg might, one way in the past, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=980.88s)]
*  a judge might try to enforce contempt [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=985.1999999999999s)]
*  is by referring it to the Department of Justice [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=988.24s)]
*  that's run by a Trump stooge. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=990.8s)]
*  Boasberg can actually appoint a prosecutor himself, right? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=994.16s)]
*  But even then, the president would have pardon power [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=997.92s)]
*  so it could shut it down at any moment. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1000.8s)]
*  This is, look, we're far from here, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1002.8399999999999s)]
*  but it is a question that I had. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1004.64s)]
*  When Trump pardoned Joe Arpaio, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1006.64s)]
*  the contempt was concluded, right? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1009.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1012.24s)]
*  If the administration takes no steps [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1013.08s)]
*  to right this wrong of these deportations [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1016.16s)]
*  that Judge Boasberg ordered stopped [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1019.44s)]
*  before they had even reached El Salvador [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1021.44s)]
*  and Trump pardons anyone connected to it, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1023.52s)]
*  the crime would be ongoing. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1026.32s)]
*  It would be a pardon of a bank robber [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1027.76s)]
*  while they're inside of the vaults. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1029.76s)]
*  So presumably contempt would just begin again [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1031.84s)]
*  because the president, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1034.08s)]
*  though the pardon power is incredible, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1035.72s)]
*  can't pardon people in the future. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1037.64s)]
*  That's true, although the president can issue [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1039.64s)]
*  a preemptive pardon here before any criminal prosecution [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1041.84s)]
*  would begin, and it's possible, and I think even likely, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1045.4s)]
*  that in the event the president did that, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1049.3600000000001s)]
*  I don't really see the federal courts [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1051.4s)]
*  then trying to go back and say, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1053.72s)]
*  well, even though he basically pardoned the offense [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1056.68s)]
*  up until this date, that offense has continued. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1059.6000000000001s)]
*  I think there would be difficult questions [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1062.56s)]
*  about whether it is indeed a new offense [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1063.76s)]
*  and my guess is the federal court [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1066.3999999999999s)]
*  would probably stand down in that situation. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1067.76s)]
*  So let's talk about what the courts are willing to do. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1070.3999999999999s)]
*  Is there a reason to have some tiny kernel [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1073.3999999999999s)]
*  of relief, if not hope, that seven members of the court, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1077.48s)]
*  including three justices appointed by President Trump, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1081.6s)]
*  stepped in to halt deportations [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1085.2s)]
*  under the Alien Enemies Act? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1088.6s)]
*  Short answer, yes. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1092.36s)]
*  At minimum, it evinces a sense [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1094.2399999999998s)]
*  that the seven justices in the majority [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1097.2399999999998s)]
*  aren't willing to take the Trump administration [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1099.56s)]
*  at their word because, of course, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1101.52s)]
*  the Trump administration was saying, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1103.4399999999998s)]
*  well, we're giving these guys reasonable time [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1104.8s)]
*  and reasonable notice to file their challenges, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1107.04s)]
*  when obviously they weren't, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1108.8s)]
*  and the administration has basically been [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1110.8s)]
*  thumbing their nose at the Supreme Court's directive [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1112.6399999999999s)]
*  and Judge Sinise's order to bring back Mr. Abrego Garcia. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1115.04s)]
*  And so I think the Supreme Court looked at all of that [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1118.9199999999998s)]
*  and realized, look, the prospect of the government [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1121.6s)]
*  shunting these people off to El Salvador [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1124.6399999999999s)]
*  and then never bringing them back is so real, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1126.52s)]
*  and the harm is so profound. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1129.3999999999999s)]
*  We need to order a halt until we figure out [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1131.6s)]
*  what is going on and whether the administration [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1135.6s)]
*  is indeed providing the individuals with the notice [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1138.08s)]
*  that we said was required in our previous decision. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1141.08s)]
*  So you're reading into what would have driven the order, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1145.1599999999999s)]
*  but the order doesn't, it's not detailed. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1148.96s)]
*  We actually, we got more information in Alito's dissent [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1151.64s)]
*  than we got in the order, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1153.8000000000002s)]
*  but is there any other way to read this [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1155.8400000000001s)]
*  than as the seven justices looking at their previous ruling [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1158.48s)]
*  requiring reasonable time and being concerned [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1163.8000000000002s)]
*  that it's not being followed? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1168.0s)]
*  No, one is that's basically the point [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1169.88s)]
*  in Justice Alito's dissent. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1172.44s)]
*  He says, you know, we should assume [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1173.92s)]
*  that the Trump administration is going to comply [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1176.56s)]
*  with our previous order directing them [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1179.16s)]
*  to provide reasonable time and notice, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1180.92s)]
*  and he faults the seven justices [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1182.68s)]
*  who halted the deportations for not doing so. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1184.48s)]
*  And I just want to kind of pause on the irony [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1187.72s)]
*  that the Supreme Court basically did in this case [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1190.68s)]
*  what they faulted Judge Boasberg for doing previously, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1193.76s)]
*  namely halt on a wholesale basis, a bunch of deportations, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1197.48s)]
*  rather than requiring every individual [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1202.76s)]
*  to challenge their deportation themselves. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1205.4s)]
*  And I think that underscores what we were talking about, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1208.96s)]
*  which is the Supreme Court realized the error of their ways, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1212.32s)]
*  that there actually needs to be this wholesale pause, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1215.44s)]
*  because if there isn't, the government is just shuttling [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1218.44s)]
*  people around between jurisdictions, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1220.96s)]
*  trying to find some court somewhere [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1223.08s)]
*  that will allow them to expel these people [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1225.8s)]
*  without due process. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1228.2s)]
*  So Alito writes this short but very mad dissent, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1229.52s)]
*  and reading it, it's very technical actually, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1235.16s)]
*  but it seems to be if you step back, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1241.8s)]
*  what he's saying is nothing extraordinary is happening [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1243.36s)]
*  to require this extraordinary response. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1247.28s)]
*  And he seems quite angry. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1250.92s)]
*  Yeah, so he basically faults the court [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1255.6s)]
*  for not adhering to their normal process. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1257.56s)]
*  And the things he points out the court did were one, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1259.8799999999999s)]
*  to grant this pause in deportations [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1263.4s)]
*  before waiting to hear the government's response [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1266.48s)]
*  is one thing. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1269.36s)]
*  Second is the Supreme Court acted [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1270.48s)]
*  by halting the deportations before waiting [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1273.0s)]
*  for the US Court of Appeals, the intermediary court [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1275.6399999999999s)]
*  between the trial court and the Supreme Court [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1278.68s)]
*  to act on the request to halt the deportations. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1280.52s)]
*  And so those are two kind of abnormal procedural moves [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1283.52s)]
*  the seven justices made that Justice Alito says, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1288.0s)]
*  what reason is there to do that? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1291.32s)]
*  But the reality is, of course, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1293.04s)]
*  we're not dealing with ordinary circumstances. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1295.32s)]
*  So, right, like you need to adapt in those circumstances [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1298.16s)]
*  where again, it looks like the administration [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1301.6s)]
*  is trying to evade any prospect of judicial review [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1303.84s)]
*  by just quickly expelling individuals [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1307.2s)]
*  without any prospect of judicial oversight. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1309.52s)]
*  He sort of plays dumb, like, why would we do this? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1311.76s)]
*  Why would we do this? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1314.08s)]
*  But seven of his colleagues have decided it was urgent. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1315.1200000000001s)]
*  And there's two aspects of it [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1318.16s)]
*  that I was wanted to hear your take on. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1319.56s)]
*  One is they put out the order [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1321.68s)]
*  before Alito had written his dissent. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1325.08s)]
*  They thought this was such an emergency [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1327.52s)]
*  that they put out the statement freezing the deportations [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1329.64s)]
*  without the attached dissent. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1333.92s)]
*  And have you seen that ever before [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1335.56s)]
*  of the dissent coming later? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1338.44s)]
*  That has happened before. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1340.56s)]
*  It happens in some courts of appeals, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1342.48s)]
*  and it does sometimes happen in the Supreme Court. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1344.3600000000001s)]
*  It's exceptionally unusual. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1346.92s)]
*  And honestly, a part of me read into this, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1349.72s)]
*  the idea that not only do the seven justices [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1352.48s)]
*  think that the Trump administration [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1354.96s)]
*  might be acting in bad faith, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1356.28s)]
*  maybe they think Sam Alito is too, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1357.8s)]
*  because if he sat on his dissent and just didn't release it [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1359.68s)]
*  until it was too late, until after the administration [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1363.4s)]
*  had expelled the many individuals to El Salvador, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1366.72s)]
*  then they would be facing the situation once again [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1370.08s)]
*  where they're trying to order the administration [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1372.6s)]
*  to return people from El Salvador. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1374.48s)]
*  And so a part of me wondered if that is what was happening [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1376.52s)]
*  and maybe that's why he's so mad, although he's usually mad. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1379.56s)]
*  There was, he is usually mad. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1383.0s)]
*  There was another part of this too, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1384.2s)]
*  which you also talked about [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1385.96s)]
*  on the most recent episode of Strict, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1387.6s)]
*  which is there's a kind of jurisdictional issue [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1390.6399999999999s)]
*  that happens with members of the Supreme Court [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1394.6399999999999s)]
*  for a case like this. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1397.36s)]
*  And in this case, it would have gone to Alito alone first. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1398.76s)]
*  And in that case, normally Alito would have had the chance [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1403.36s)]
*  to rule or refer it to the full court, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1406.84s)]
*  but it seems like maybe that didn't happen here. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1409.36s)]
*  Yeah, so there's an odd wording in the order, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1411.56s)]
*  which just noted there's an application [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1414.48s)]
*  that is pending before the court. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1416.68s)]
*  The usual wording is the application was presented [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1418.16s)]
*  to Justice Alito and referred by him to the court. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1421.8799999999999s)]
*  That's not what the order said. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1424.76s)]
*  And so that too lends itself to some speculation of [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1426.3999999999999s)]
*  was Sam Alito just sitting on this application, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1429.9599999999998s)]
*  not referring it to all of the members of the court, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1433.12s)]
*  again, in order to buy the administration time. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1436.4399999999998s)]
*  And we don't know whether that did indeed happen. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1440.32s)]
*  I just like to note to any member of the Supreme Court [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1444.56s)]
*  that I am on signal if you want to accidentally add me [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1446.9199999999998s)]
*  to your group chat and let me know what's going on. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1449.56s)]
*  But that too, you know, is a possibility [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1452.7199999999998s)]
*  that the seven justices were just concerned. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1457.28s)]
*  He was trying to run out the clock. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1458.28s)]
*  On the other side of the conservative legal spectrum, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1460.56s)]
*  you have Judge Harvey Wilkinson, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1463.56s)]
*  who wrote a beautiful and extraordinary ruling [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1466.84s)]
*  around these deportations. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1474.4399999999998s)]
*  Is there any part of it that has stuck out with you? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1476.8s)]
*  I think it was an incredibly powerful writing. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1479.0s)]
*  I especially appreciated his call to other judges [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1481.72s)]
*  and to the executive branch to insist [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1485.84s)]
*  that the executive branch abide by the law. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1488.84s)]
*  And I thought that was especially pointed [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1491.6s)]
*  because many of the Supreme Court's actions to date [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1493.9199999999998s)]
*  have looked like attempts to avoid confrontations [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1497.24s)]
*  with the Trump administration [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1500.08s)]
*  and to avoid really holding their feet to the fire [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1501.52s)]
*  and them accountable to the law, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1504.2s)]
*  maybe out of concern that they just wouldn't abide [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1506.04s)]
*  by the court's order, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1508.36s)]
*  but that's an unsustainable state of affairs. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1509.6s)]
*  You can't just give the administration the green light [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1512.52s)]
*  and not do anything [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1515.8s)]
*  because you think they will disobey a court order. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1517.68s)]
*  You're in effect, like allowing them to violate the law [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1520.8799999999999s)]
*  if that's what you do. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1523.8s)]
*  And so I really appreciated Judge Wilkinson [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1524.68s)]
*  coming down hard on that point and really writing, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1527.44s)]
*  I think, for the Republican appointees [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1531.8799999999999s)]
*  on the Supreme Court. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1533.84s)]
*  Leah Lippman, thank you so much. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1535.08s)]

*  including three members appointed by President Trump, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1724.52s)]

*  On one hand, seven-two ruling, we like that. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1771.32s)]
*  On the other, the calls from Trump's base [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1774.48s)]
*  to defy the court and by extension the Constitution [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1776.78s)]
*  seem to be getting louder and more numerous. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1780.32s)]
*  Or melt them in acid, it sounds like. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1782.6s)]
*  Yeah, the head of The Federalist posted after that missive, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1785.04s)]
*  when we're done deporting illegals, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1788.8s)]

*  Cool, cool, cool. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1793.0s)]
*  Also, if you're using the word parasitical, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1793.9199999999998s)]
*  you're just trying too hard, in my opinion. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1795.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's like you're the White House liaison [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1797.46s)]
*  to Homeland Security. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1799.52s)]
*  It's not like you gotta get some attention there. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1800.4399999999998s)]
*  It's just an intellectual treatise. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1802.8799999999999s)]
*  It was like this intellectual, right? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1804.3999999999999s)]
*  It was just this sort of treatise about why seven justices, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1806.3999999999999s)]
*  including the three Donald Trump appointed, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1811.24s)]
*  are not just wrong, but they have to be captured [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1813.52s)]
*  by liberal ideology. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1815.7199999999998s)]
*  They must be evil. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1816.56s)]
*  Because there's no other way to make sense [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1817.52s)]
*  of why they would do this. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1819.4399999999998s)]
*  Disagree? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1821.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1822.6s)]
*  It's interesting, just these people that you've picked out, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1825.32s)]
*  a lot of them have sounded like, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1827.6399999999999s)]
*  these are the fringe that are now in more, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1829.1999999999998s)]
*  either in the government or just louder voices [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1831.6s)]
*  that reflect a bigger part of the base. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1834.12s)]
*  These are people that have talked this way [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1836.0s)]
*  and thought this way for a long time. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1838.32s)]
*  But for the first time, there's a genuine possibility [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1840.6799999999998s)]
*  that the president, that the people that work [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1843.1599999999999s)]
*  for the president might actually listen to these cranks, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1845.9199999999998s)]
*  these sort of authoritarian right-wing fucking cranks, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1849.04s)]
*  and it is really, really scary. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1852.04s)]
*  I also think it's important to note [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1853.62s)]
*  that before this ruling, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1855.04s)]
*  Trump was planning to openly defy the Supreme Court [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1856.72s)]
*  by deporting these men without giving them due process [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1860.64s)]
*  that was ordered by the Supreme Court. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1864.0s)]
*  And they were given a piece of paper in English only, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1866.04s)]
*  told to sign it, and then load it on buses. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1868.28s)]
*  And thank God the Supreme Court was working weekends [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1870.56s)]
*  this week, or else these men would almost certainly [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1873.88s)]
*  be in El Salvador right now. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1876.64s)]
*  God bless the ACLU, by the way, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1878.68s)]
*  for these lawyers sprinting through courtrooms [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1880.88s)]
*  and filing emergency injunctions [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1884.0s)]
*  and doing everything they can to protect these people. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1885.58s)]
*  I understand why there's been so much focus [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1887.6999999999998s)]
*  on Abrego Garcia, because that is the one case [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1890.02s)]
*  where the government admitted in court multiple times [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1892.8999999999999s)]
*  that it was an error. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1896.3999999999999s)]
*  But when you really dig into a lot of these folks [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1897.46s)]
*  who are getting deported under Alien Enemies Act [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1901.04s)]
*  to El Salvador, the administration's putting out like, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1903.1399999999999s)]
*  here are six people and all of the most horrible things [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1907.3s)]
*  they've ever done that we're sending there. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1910.78s)]
*  And it's like, okay, fine. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1912.06s)]
*  There was like 200 something that have been sent there. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1913.3799999999999s)]
*  And the New York Times did a story on this [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1916.58s)]
*  about what led to the late night ruling [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1919.5s)]
*  and sort of the scramble by the ACLU. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1922.22s)]
*  And they said one of the men, last name Prieto, said, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1924.3s)]
*  there had been no order for his deportation [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1927.4599999999998s)]
*  and that his immigration documents were in order. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1929.6599999999999s)]
*  He said, I have American children. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1931.62s)]
*  They brought me here and I'm innocent. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1933.4599999999998s)]
*  They arrested me without any warrant for nothing. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1934.82s)]
*  For nothing they brought me here. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1936.84s)]
*  And then they mentioned this story Tommy told [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1938.74s)]
*  about the guy who was forced to sign. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1940.62s)]
*  There's another guy who had TPS, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1944.02s)]
*  the ice broke into his house and was about to deport him. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1944.8600000000001s)]
*  They held him for a couple months. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1947.1000000000001s)]
*  We've talked about Andre, the Venezuelan makeup artist. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1948.18s)]
*  We've talked, and there's just so many stories like that [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1950.7s)]
*  that it's, and some of these people have even less [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1953.1000000000001s)]
*  of a connection than, you know, Garcia was alleged to have [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1956.6200000000001s)]
*  and you know, by some random cop somewhere. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1961.14s)]
*  The other sort of line of reasoning [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1963.54s)]
*  from some of these far right people is, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1967.1000000000001s)]
*  well, if we can't deport people, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1969.3400000000001s)]
*  well, we don't have a country anymore. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1973.92s)]
*  And first of all, Donald Trump can deport people [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1974.8799999999999s)]
*  has his will, he's allowed to deport a lot. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1978.76s)]
*  Tens of thousands every month so far. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1981.3999999999999s)]
*  The other part of this is, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1984.48s)]
*  why is he deporting people to a foreign Gulag? [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1986.0s)]
*  No one, no one on Fox, none of these people will grapple [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1991.0s)]
*  with the fucking Gulag part of this. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1995.02s)]
*  None of them will defend it. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1996.72s)]
*  They act like, well, we just dropped them off in El Salvador [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=1998.2s)]
*  and suddenly they ended up in the jail there, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2000.3999999999999s)]
*  which is just not what happened. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2003.1s)]
*  We're paying them to house them. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2003.94s)]
*  And that's what makes, I think, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2004.76s)]
*  and I talked about this a bit with Leah, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2005.6s)]
*  like sort of the legal aspects of it, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2007.6599999999999s)]
*  but it is extraordinary that the Supreme Court [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2010.86s)]
*  has done this because they're basically acknowledging [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2012.94s)]
*  the urgency of it, that doing it in the middle of the night, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2017.1s)]
*  that doing it before Alito could finish his own dissent, [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2019.34s)]
*  they are acknowledging that by the logic [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2021.82s)]
*  of the Supreme Court, which Wilkinson talked about [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2023.54s)]
*  in his ruling last week, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2026.1399999999999s)]
*  that if they deport someone in error to this prison, [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2029.08s)]
*  they can't get them back. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2033.22s)]
*  And the Supreme Court, which already said people have a right [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2034.0600000000002s)]
*  to a certain amount of time to respond, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2036.7s)]
*  is clearly saying here, this is so urgent, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2038.18s)]
*  this is so dangerous, we gotta shut this all down right now [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2040.5400000000002s)]
*  until we've had more time to examine [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2044.18s)]
*  what the Trump administration is doing [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2046.7800000000002s)]
*  and we can't take what the Trump administration says [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2048.54s)]
*  at face value. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2050.98s)]
*  We cannot believe them when they say that, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2051.9s)]
*  oh, there aren't gonna be any flights this weekend, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2055.58s)]
*  or they're not aware of any flights this weekend, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2057.3s)]
*  that the lawyers that are speaking to the court [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2059.62s)]
*  on behalf of the Trump administration [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2062.96s)]
*  either are not telling the truth [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2063.7999999999997s)]
*  or don't have all the facts themselves. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2064.8399999999997s)]
*  What's confusing about this is, politically speaking, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2066.72s)]
*  there seems to be a much easier, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2069.92s)]
*  much smarter path for Donald Trump, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2071.16s)]
*  which is to say that the border's locked down, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2072.48s)]
*  take the win there, and then slowly, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2075.04s)]
*  methodically deport people. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2076.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean, the proximate reason why they are deporting [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2078.3999999999996s)]
*  Venezuelans to El Salvador, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2080.74s)]
*  because Venezuela won't take back Venezuelans, right? [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2082.0s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that it has to happen tomorrow [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2085.12s)]
*  or the next day. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2087.64s)]
*  And I assume that they're shredding the Constitution [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2088.48s)]
*  because this is Stephen Miller's passion project. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2091.18s)]
*  Donald Trump cares a lot about it, too. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2094.5s)]
*  There's an element of their base that loves it. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2095.7s)]
*  But I do, and there's probably a deterrent effect [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2097.5s)]
*  for others who might come here if they see the United States [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2099.3599999999997s)]
*  being just unbelievably cruel to everyone, no matter what. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2101.4199999999996s)]
*  But, politically speaking, I do think there is some risk [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2105.22s)]
*  that people are gonna say, why are you doing this? [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2108.8599999999997s)]
*  Why are you so focused on this stuff? [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2110.68s)]
*  Why are we not allowing people a day in court? [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2111.8599999999997s)]
*  That doesn't seem that hard. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2114.58s)]
*  Like, JD Vance's fuckin' Twitter op-ed screed [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2115.7s)]
*  about how sometimes it's inconvenient to allow [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2119.9s)]
*  for due process or it costs too much [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2122.06s)]
*  or it takes too many resources. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2123.7400000000002s)]
*  Like, I don't think anyone believes that. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2124.6600000000003s)]
*  Well, it's true that there is a large backlog [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2126.7000000000003s)]
*  of immigration cases, because we don't have enough [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2131.14s)]
*  immigration judges and our system has been broken [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2132.92s)]
*  for a long time. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2136.34s)]
*  There's a way to fix that, which is pass legislation [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2137.7000000000003s)]
*  that funds more immigration judges. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2140.54s)]
*  Oh, by the way, that was the legislation that Joe Biden, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2141.9s)]
*  Democrats in Congress, and a bunch of conservative [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2145.46s)]
*  Republicans tried to pass, and then Donald Trump killed it [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2147.1s)]
*  because he wanted the issue, right? [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2150.58s)]
*  So that tells you a lot about if they're really interested [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2151.4199999999996s)]
*  in actually solving the backlog of immigration cases. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2152.9399999999996s)]
*  Also, there's plenty of ways to expedite deportations [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2154.9399999999996s)]
*  if you need to, if there's a public safety threat, you can. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2159.4199999999996s)]
*  Like, there's a million different ways to deport people. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2161.8199999999997s)]
*  They've done it before, Joe Biden's done it, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2164.4599999999996s)]
*  they're doing it now since they became president, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2166.8999999999996s)]
*  Barack Obama did it, George W. Bush did it. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2169.4599999999996s)]
*  It's complete bullshit, this whole, like, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2171.1s)]
*  if we cannot throw people in the gulag, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2173.54s)]
*  we don't have a country anymore. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2175.9399999999996s)]
*  If we can't, we're not gonna deport millions of people [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2177.46s)]
*  100 at a time on an airplane to a foreign jail. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2180.82s)]
*  Even all of this is still a sideshow. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2184.2200000000003s)]
*  There are millions and millions of people in this country [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2187.14s)]
*  who are undocumented. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2189.54s)]
*  They came here to work. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2190.46s)]
*  They came here to work because we built a system [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2192.1s)]
*  of second-class citizenship for people [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2196.14s)]
*  who can get to this country, they can be employed. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2197.86s)]
*  There are people that have wanted to do things [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2200.58s)]
*  like e-verify, which would require employers [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2202.06s)]
*  to make sure someone is a citizen before they are hired. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2205.3s)]
*  There are lots of, I think undocumented people, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2209.54s)]
*  I think we should have a path to citizenship. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2212.86s)]
*  I'm not saying that these are good ideas. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2213.98s)]
*  There are lots of steps you could take [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2216.34s)]
*  to address undocumented immigrants. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2217.94s)]
*  They have chosen to target, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2219.46s)]
*  people have received temporary protected status, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2220.98s)]
*  asylum seekers, right? [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2222.82s)]
*  Like, they are choosing this because, first of all, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2224.0600000000004s)]
*  I think they like the politics better. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2226.7000000000003s)]
*  And second of all, it doesn't make a lot of their biggest, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2228.3s)]
*  wealthiest donors angry when it cracks down on the people [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2231.1000000000004s)]
*  that work for agribusiness, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2233.74s)]
*  when it cracks down on the people [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2235.1s)]
*  that work for construction companies, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2235.9399999999996s)]
*  when it cracks down on the people that make our economy go. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2237.06s)]
*  Yeah, so like you said, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2240.9799999999996s)]
*  I mean, this is not just about our Braco Garcia. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2242.18s)]
*  It's not just about other immigrants [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2245.5s)]
*  who came here illegally. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2246.9799999999996s)]
*  So far, more than 1,000 foreign students [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2248.4599999999996s)]
*  have had their visas canceled, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2250.9799999999996s)]
*  including many who aren't political activists, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2252.4599999999996s)]
*  haven't even publicly shared their political views. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2255.2599999999998s)]
*  We're also seeing more horror stories [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2258.54s)]
*  about the government throwing people behind bars [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2260.14s)]
*  for doing nothing wrong. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2261.7799999999997s)]
*  We learned on Friday that Jose Hermosillo, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2262.94s)]
*  an American citizen from New Mexico, [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2267.46s)]
*  was arrested by border patrol while on a walk [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2269.1s)]
*  during a visit to Arizona, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2271.14s)]
*  and was then detained in an ICE facility for 10 days, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2272.58s)]
*  10 days until his family was able to prove his citizenship [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2276.14s)]
*  and get him out. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2279.26s)]
*  We also learned that in mid-March, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2280.7000000000003s)]
*  two teenage girls from Germany [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2282.06s)]
*  were detained at the Honolulu airport [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2283.86s)]
*  after saying that they hadn't booked accommodations [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2285.66s)]
*  for their entire five-week stay in Hawaii. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2287.7400000000002s)]
*  They were held overnight [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2290.3s)]
*  in what they said were appalling conditions, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2291.42s)]
*  and then deported to Tokyo. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2293.06s)]
*  DHS says they were kicked out [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2294.9s)]
*  because they said they told CPB agents [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2296.34s)]
*  that they planned to work while traveling, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2299.2200000000003s)]
*  which they didn't have the right visa for, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2301.02s)]
*  but the students say that when they were pressed on this, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2302.58s)]
*  they simply told the agents [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2305.1s)]
*  that they sometimes do freelance jobs online [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2306.26s)]
*  for customers back in Germany. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2309.34s)]
*  Feels like this probably isn't helping [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2312.7000000000003s)]
*  the huge drop-off in tourism to the US. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2313.94s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, in 2023, international visitors [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2317.34s)]
*  spent roughly $225 billion in the US. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2319.5s)]
*  So if a big chunk of that goes away, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2323.14s)]
*  that's gonna be not a tiny hit to GDP, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2324.46s)]
*  and it will have the potential to decimate [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2326.62s)]
*  specific communities that are tourism destinations. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2329.5s)]
*  And we're already seeing this with Canada [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2331.78s)]
*  because this precipitated immigration questions. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2333.66s)]
*  This was about Trump threatening to annex the country. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2335.5s)]
*  Canadian car trips to the US are down 32% last month [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2338.66s)]
*  compared to March 2024. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2341.86s)]
*  Air travel is down 13% year-over-year, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2343.58s)]
*  and airline bookings are down 70%. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2345.94s)]
*  And so if you sort of extrapolate that out, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2350.3s)]
*  if people around the world are just like, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2352.54s)]
*  I can't go to the United States. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2353.38s)]
*  They're gonna fuck with me or treat me horribly [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2355.2200000000003s)]
*  or God knows. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2357.1800000000003s)]
*  Goldman Sachs said there's a worst-case scenario [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2359.42s)]
*  where the US could lose $90 billion in revenue this year [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2362.62s)]
*  from a decrease in tourism [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2366.3s)]
*  and people just choosing not to buy American stuff. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2368.42s)]
*  I saw a couple of people pointing out [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2371.1400000000003s)]
*  that we're supposed to have an Olympics here [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2373.1800000000003s)]
*  in a couple years. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2375.98s)]
*  We're supposed to have the World Cup here. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2376.82s)]
*  Other countries are issuing travel warnings [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2379.38s)]
*  to the United States, like our allies or former allies. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2382.38s)]
*  And the soccer, the World Cup, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2386.7400000000002s)]
*  it's supposed to be a pan-North American games. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2388.7000000000003s)]
*  So if we're still fighting with the Canadians [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2392.42s)]
*  and fighting with the Mexicans, it's not gonna be good. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2393.94s)]
*  Be like when Carter didn't let the Americans go to Russia. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2396.7400000000002s)]
*  You know? [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2399.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2400.34s)]
*  Multiple US citizens now have gotten these random emails, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2401.78s)]
*  letters from ICE, from the CPB saying, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2404.9s)]
*  you have to leave the country now. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2410.2200000000003s)]
*  And maybe they were in error, maybe they weren't. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2412.1800000000003s)]
*  Another US citizen was detained in Miami for a while. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2414.54s)]
*  Four students at Case Western Reserve [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2419.02s)]
*  were told their visas were revoked [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2420.94s)]
*  and that they needed to leave [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2422.98s)]
*  and then they had to go to court. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2424.54s)]
*  And the government was like, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2425.42s)]
*  oh, maybe we screwed up, we're not sure. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2426.26s)]
*  The judge was like so angry. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2428.06s)]
*  He was like, this is Kafkaesque, I can't believe it. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2429.46s)]
*  He's like, the government's telling me [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2431.26s)]
*  they don't even know if these people are here legally or not. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2433.1s)]
*  You can't even tell me this, the government counsel, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2435.7s)]
*  but you just arrested them. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2437.18s)]
*  And the other thing that I think was happening here [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2440.7s)]
*  is these agents, whether they're ICE agents or CPB agents, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2443.2999999999997s)]
*  they're lying. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2447.58s)]
*  And I don't wanna impugn all of them, right? [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2449.18s)]
*  But like the Hermosillo, the guy who was detained in Arizona, [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2451.3399999999997s)]
*  like he was arrested in Tucson. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2455.2599999999998s)]
*  The agent says he was actually in Nogales, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2458.1s)]
*  which is an hour south of Tucson, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2461.66s)]
*  and that's where they picked him up. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2464.2599999999998s)]
*  So we know he was lying about that. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2465.42s)]
*  So the rest of the lie, which is like, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2467.06s)]
*  oh, he told them he was here unlawfully [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2468.42s)]
*  and that's why they detained him, [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2470.2999999999997s)]
*  which is now what fucking DHS is saying. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2471.54s)]
*  Trisha McLaughlin, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2473.42s)]
*  the spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2474.2599999999998s)]
*  tweeted that this 19-year-old American citizen [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2476.22s)]
*  walked up to a border patrol agent and said, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2479.3399999999997s)]
*  hey, I entered illegally from Mexico. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2482.5s)]
*  Did he offer up this information? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2485.18s)]
*  And she tweets this thinking that this is a credible story [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2486.3799999999997s)]
*  in any way, doesn't think that maybe, fact check it? [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2489.42s)]
*  It happens all the time. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2491.58s)]
*  You get caught by a federal agent, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2492.54s)]
*  you're like, I'm here illegally, I came from Mexico. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2493.7400000000002s)]
*  Throughout all of this, right, [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2497.42s)]
*  we've been saying this could come for US citizens, right? [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2498.78s)]
*  And the fact that the government is willing [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2501.86s)]
*  not just to do this without due process, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2504.6600000000003s)]
*  not just to repair it when a judge orders it, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2507.62s)]
*  but that the spokesperson [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2510.62s)]
*  for the Department of Homeland Security [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2512.06s)]
*  is actively lying about this case is, here it is. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2513.42s)]
*  This is an American citizen who was picked up. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2516.06s)]
*  They are clearly lying. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2518.3s)]
*  She is just passing along this fucking lie, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2519.42s)]
*  and what if he had been on a plane to El Salvador? [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2522.1800000000003s)]
*  The kid was in jail for 10 days [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2524.94s)]
*  before they sorted things out. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2527.5s)]
*  The government couldn't call the government [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2528.34s)]
*  to figure out if he was a citizen? [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2529.86s)]
*  It took 10 days? [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2531.26s)]
*  This is where it's like the kind of intellectualizing [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2532.46s)]
*  that like JD Vance and others are doing [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2535.1s)]
*  to defend this behavior. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2537.3s)]
*  It's so ridiculous and so just so false on its face. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2538.9s)]
*  Let's say every single sentence [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2543.46s)]
*  about what you're trying to do is true. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2545.42s)]
*  Why wouldn't you wanna fix mistakes? [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2547.74s)]
*  Why would you wanna lie about Americans? [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2549.5s)]
*  Why wouldn't you wanna get it right? [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2551.1s)]
*  Even on your own fucking terms, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2552.4199999999996s)]
*  why wouldn't you wanna get it right? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2554.22s)]
*  Because I think it was like what Tommy was saying. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2555.66s)]
*  I think they just wanna scare the shit out of people. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2557.66s)]
*  And I also think they have a one million deportee quota [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2560.06s)]
*  that Stephen Miller is pushing them to meet [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2563.74s)]
*  over the course of the year. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2566.7799999999997s)]
*  Minnesota, look, last week, [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2567.7799999999997s)]
*  there's a guy from Indonesia who's here on a student visa [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2569.58s)]
*  working at a hospital in Minnesota. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2573.02s)]
*  His student visa was revoked four days before his arrest, [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2575.82s)]
*  but he wasn't told, [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2579.9s)]
*  he wasn't notified that the visa was revoked. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2581.02s)]
*  And so then they just arrested him [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2583.02s)]
*  because he overstayed the visa for four days [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2584.1800000000003s)]
*  after not telling him. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2585.7000000000003s)]
*  They asked why, he doesn't understand. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2588.5s)]
*  He has an eight month old daughter, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2589.82s)]
*  American wife citizen, doesn't understand. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2591.26s)]
*  He's been here since 2015, came legally. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2593.2200000000003s)]
*  And they said, oh, he's a threat to public safety. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2595.9s)]
*  So then they looked into his background. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2597.7000000000003s)]
*  In 2022, he pled to a misdemeanor [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2599.9s)]
*  for spray painting graffiti on a bridge. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2602.3s)]
*  And then the big one, he was charged with unlawful assembly [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2604.82s)]
*  over a protest around George Floyd's murder [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2608.3s)]
*  that was later dismissed. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2610.7400000000002s)]
*  Not violent, not nothing, no property destruction, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2612.26s)]
*  no nothing, just showing up there. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2614.98s)]
*  And so I do think that on student visa stuff, [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2616.86s)]
*  they're starting with the Gaza stuff, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2619.6200000000003s)]
*  but they're just going after, [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2621.7400000000002s)]
*  and they're doing this with like AI too. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2623.26s)]
*  They're looking through anyone who's here on a student visa. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2625.5400000000004s)]
*  If you've ever had any run-ins with the law [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2628.38s)]
*  that aren't political, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2629.94s)]
*  or if you've ever shown up [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2630.9s)]
*  at any kind of political protest anywhere, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2631.7400000000002s)]
*  that's how they're targeting people now. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2633.6600000000003s)]
*  It's just gross. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2635.42s)]
*  Not January 6th. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2636.26s)]
*  Right, yeah, of course, of course. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2637.1s)]
*  One sign that the deportation stories [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2639.78s)]
*  are starting to break through [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2641.7000000000003s)]
*  in a way that the White House can't be too happy about [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2642.6600000000003s)]
*  is that they're losing Joe Rogan. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2645.26s)]
*  Here he is talking about it on his show. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2646.98s)]
*  The problem with things that are going [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2649.02s)]
*  in a radical direction, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2650.6600000000003s)]
*  and then there's an overcorrection. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2651.78s)]
*  So the overcorrection is lack of due process. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2654.26s)]
*  The overcorrection is like, round them all up, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2657.2200000000003s)]
*  ship them to jail. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2659.86s)]
*  That's like some things that you say [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2661.5s)]
*  when you're not thinking things through. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2663.2200000000003s)]
*  What do you do about all the criminals? [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2664.7400000000002s)]
*  Take them all, fucking send them to El Salvador. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2665.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2669.02s)]
*  What about due process? [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2669.86s)]
*  No, fuck that. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2670.78s)]
*  Well, here's the problem with fuck that. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2671.98s)]
*  What if you are an enemy of, [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2673.7400000000002s)]
*  let's not say any current president. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2676.98s)]
*  Let's pretend we got a new president, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2678.7400000000002s)]
*  totally new guy in 2028, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2680.6200000000003s)]
*  and this is a common practice now [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2683.58s)]
*  of just rounding up gang members with no due process [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2686.3s)]
*  and shipping them to El Salvador. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2689.18s)]
*  You're a gang member. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2691.54s)]
*  No, I'm not. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2692.4199999999996s)]
*  Prove it. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2693.2599999999998s)]
*  What? [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2694.1s)]
*  I gotta go to court. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2694.94s)]
*  No, no due process. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2695.7599999999998s)]
*  Joe Rogan making a lot of sense. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2696.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2698.94s)]
*  It's also like, to back to where we started, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2699.7799999999997s)]
*  like, do you wanna, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2701.4199999999996s)]
*  do you, like, this is breaking through for people. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2703.2999999999997s)]
*  Do you wanna be seen as fighting, [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2706.8599999999997s)]
*  as having a genuine moral conviction during this moment? [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2708.66s)]
*  Or do you wanna be out there saying it's a distraction [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2711.1s)]
*  and that we really need to be talking about [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2714.14s)]
*  the cost of living? [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2715.22s)]
*  There are people watching [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2716.5s)]
*  to see what people stand for right now. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2717.46s)]
*  I think Rogan weighing in on this really is meaningful. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2719.86s)]
*  I mean, it also just reflects the reality [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2723.9s)]
*  that there are, like, we hear the MAGA dead ender crazies [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2726.22s)]
*  that you read out. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2729.12s)]
*  Like, they get quoted, they get picked up in the media, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2729.96s)]
*  but most normies are like, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2732.22s)]
*  of course I believe in due process. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2733.66s)]
*  Of course you should have a day in court. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2735.3s)]
*  The idea of, like, hurting an innocent person, [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2736.96s)]
*  you can empathize with that easily, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2740.06s)]
*  and it's offensive to you. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2742.06s)]
*  And so, like, it's great to hear Rogan talking about this [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2744.2599999999998s)]
*  to his audience. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2747.62s)]
*  I hope he keeps doing it. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2748.46s)]
*  I also think it reflects the reality [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2749.2799999999997s)]
*  that Trump is good as an opposition leader, [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2750.38s)]
*  but he fucking sucks at governing. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2752.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and to your point, there's also this, like, well, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2754.08s)]
*  the Trump White House thinks they're winning the issue [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2757.54s)]
*  because they love talking about this. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2759.38s)]
*  One reason they might be talking about it so much [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2761.22s)]
*  is because they're worried [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2763.2999999999997s)]
*  that the narrative's gonna get away from them [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2764.14s)]
*  and that they're gonna lose the argument, [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2765.46s)]
*  and that's why they have to lie about everything [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2766.58s)]
*  and talk about it nonstop. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2768.22s)]
*  And that's why, like, Stephen Miller is screaming. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2769.42s)]
*  Which, by the way, did you hear the Strix Gruteney [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2771.2599999999998s)]
*  hosts call him Pee-wee German? [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2774.1s)]
*  Yeah. Amazing. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2776.02s)]
*  Amazing. Pee-wee German. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2777.02s)]
*  Well, one of the reasons they wanna be talking about this [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2779.36s)]
*  is the markets are tanking, [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2781.46s)]
*  that people are angry about the tariffs, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2783.7400000000002s)]
*  the cost of living is going up, not down, [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2785.9s)]
*  his approval on the economy is as low as it's ever been [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2788.02s)]
*  since he's been president, last term, this term. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2791.34s)]
*  So they have a real big problem on their hands. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2794.2200000000003s)]
*  But I also think that they are genuinely, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2796.98s)]
*  there is a concern [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2799.42s)]
*  that they're going to lose the narrative here. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2800.38s)]
*  And right before we recorded it, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2801.84s)]
*  I don't know if you guys saw that Trump posted [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2803.34s)]
*  about the court and the 7-2 decision. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2805.52s)]
*  And it was a very uncharacteristic Trump truth, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2807.56s)]
*  because he was like, I have great respect for the court, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2810.28s)]
*  but even the Supreme Court, I have great respect for, [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2813.04s)]
*  are now saying that I can't deport Venezuelans [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2815.6s)]
*  or anyone back to their country, even if they're violent, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2818.64s)]
*  and I don't like that, and blah, blah, blah. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2821.76s)]
*  But he's like, at least Alito understood. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2823.12s)]
*  Well, that's what he's, look, they're fucking all hyper, [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2825.52s)]
*  all the people that are around Donald Trump [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2828.8s)]
*  are like super online [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2829.96s)]
*  and reading all the same stuff we're talking about. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2831.16s)]
*  What Trump has been doing is saying, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2833.48s)]
*  like, Pam, we got to figure out what the law is, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2836.36s)]
*  got to follow the law. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2837.36s)]
*  I have great respect for the Supreme Court [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2838.2000000000003s)]
*  while they kind of play this sort of, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2839.52s)]
*  this game of breaking, kind of breaking, [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2841.36s)]
*  directly breaking the orders. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2844.18s)]
*  I do think you kind of get back to this sort of, [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2846.96s)]
*  you know, the Pope died, and there's this apocryphal, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2849.2000000000003s)]
*  maybe it's apocryphal, Stalin quote of like, [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2851.64s)]
*  oh, how many divisions does the Pope have? [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2853.7200000000003s)]
*  And you see a lot, you see Joe Rogan, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2855.8s)]
*  but you also see a lot of, I think, [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2859.0s)]

*  I think the Wilkinson opinion matters. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2866.6s)]
*  I think the intellectual conversation on the right [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2868.72s)]
*  does still impossibly matter. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2870.44s)]
*  I remember when Kennedy, senator from Louisiana, [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2874.1s)]

*  you got to follow court orders, right? [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2882.8s)]
*  That's what Schumer has been banking on. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2884.56s)]
*  And I don't know, but it does feel like they, at least, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2886.36s)]
*  in the White House, are not completely sure [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2889.4s)]
*  that they will get away with outright breaking, [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2892.22s)]
*  right now, a Supreme Court order. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2895.58s)]
*  Yeah, which is why I think you have Stephen Miller [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2897.06s)]
*  just like lying about the decision. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2899.06s)]

*  I value his friendship, and we accomplished a lot together. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2965.7799999999997s)]

*  it's, quote, totally unacceptable, [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2984.62s)]
*  and that Hegseth is, quote, acting like he's above the law, [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2986.58s)]
*  and that shows an amateur person. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2989.22s)]
*  Today, NPR reported that the White House [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=2991.3399999999997s)]

*  come out from the same media that peddled the Russia hoax, [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3027.54s)]

*  See, this is what the media does. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3034.62s)]
*  They take anonymous sources from disgruntled former employees, [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3036.8s)]
*  and then they try to slash and burn people [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3041.2000000000003s)]
*  and ruin their reputations. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3043.48s)]

*  He's going to the funeral with Melania [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3096.84s)]

*  that Hegseth shared here in both Signal and, [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3109.24s)]
*  I thought the op-ed from Politico was wild, [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3111.84s)]
*  but why don't you? [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3113.44s)]
*  I mean, it sounds like he was sharing [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3114.28s)]
*  the same basic information, [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3116.48s)]
*  like the F-18s are gonna bomb this target at this time. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3118.04s)]
*  It's a classic to share the same joke [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3122.08s)]
*  in multiple group chats. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3124.28s)]

*  whether or not to bomb Yemen. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3138.52s)]
*  This was a group started by Hegseth himself, [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3140.4s)]
*  and it was created on his personal phone, [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3142.88s)]

*  I mean, I think there's probably a half dozen [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3147.1200000000003s)]
*  intel agencies that have tried to break that phone. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3150.88s)]

*  and he's just sharing classified information on it. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3155.52s)]
*  Do you think he uses a really great password manager [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3158.6s)]
*  on his private phone? [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3161.56s)]
*  Hegseth, do you think Hegseth's got state of the art? [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3162.4s)]
*  Absolutely, absolutely. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3165.6s)]

*  Weekend. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3169.08s)]
*  Can we talk about the chaos in the Pentagon [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3169.92s)]
*  that this guy wrote about who used to be spokesman? [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3174.6s)]

*  as like a few anonymous sources, [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3178.96s)]
*  but it seems like there's like a mutiny going on in there. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3180.1200000000003s)]
*  What's weird about this is they've already purged [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3182.92s)]
*  the Biden-era professional people, right? [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3185.88s)]
*  C.Q. Prown, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, out. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3188.88s)]
*  Lisa Franchetti, who was the director of the Navy, out. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3191.2000000000003s)]
*  And they're slowly starting to replace them. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3194.6s)]
*  But the people we're talking about, Hegseth firing here, [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3196.48s)]
*  or they're getting pushed out [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3199.04s)]
*  in this leak investigation or whatever, are like his guys. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3199.92s)]
*  Like Dan Caldwell, the dude who was his senior advisor, [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3202.6s)]
*  he was his friend of over a decade. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3206.44s)]
*  They worked together at that nonprofit. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3207.7200000000003s)]
*  He was the point of contact [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3209.52s)]
*  on that original Mike Waltz signal gate, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3210.84s)]
*  being like, if I can't be around to talk about this issue, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3213.04s)]
*  Dan is my proxy. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3218.06s)]
*  And now they're forcing these guys out. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3219.2400000000002s)]
*  So Hegseth is missing. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3220.6600000000003s)]
*  Now he no longer has his senior advisor, [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3222.32s)]
*  his chief of staff, his deputy chief of staff. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3224.2000000000003s)]
*  And I think there's some other officials [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3226.0s)]
*  that have been pushed out. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3227.2000000000003s)]
*  So it just sounds like it's chaos over there. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3228.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, the spokesman says it's chaos. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3230.52s)]
*  And it is the Defense Department [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3232.04s)]
*  that he's running the US military. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3234.2000000000003s)]
*  Well, it's almost as if when people noted before [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3236.92s)]
*  that he'd run two tiny nonprofits. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3240.56s)]
*  Poorly. Poorly. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3242.32s)]
*  Couldn't do it. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3243.36s)]
*  Had a bunch of public intoxication, chaos, missing money, [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3244.88s)]
*  all kinds of problems in running these groups. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3249.56s)]
*  When people say- Salt allegations. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3251.2s)]
*  He wasn't up for the job of running these organs, [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3252.12s)]
*  the biggest bureaucracy in the federal government, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3255.52s)]
*  there might've been some fucking truth to it. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3259.06s)]
*  And that now, you can spin your way to it. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3260.48s)]
*  You can bully a bunch of Republican senators [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3264.64s)]
*  into going along with this, but now he has the job. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3267.7999999999997s)]
*  And it's a real job and he can't do it. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3271.2000000000003s)]
*  And shit could go down. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3272.2000000000003s)]
*  We don't know what's happening behind the scenes. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3274.8s)]
*  We don't know what debates might scare us [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3276.08s)]
*  if we were aware of them. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3278.7200000000003s)]
*  But you had C.K. Brown, the chairman of the Joint Chief, [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3279.56s)]
*  got pushed out. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3281.48s)]
*  The new guy, Dan Cain, was just confirmed. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3282.6s)]
*  Raising Cain. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3285.76s)]
*  The other day, Raising Cain. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3286.6s)]
*  And he had been retired for a year. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3287.44s)]
*  So he's getting back up to speed. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3288.84s)]
*  And also there is this battle in Republican foreign policy [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3290.84s)]
*  between the more isolationist wing of the MAGA world [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3294.32s)]
*  and the more traditional neocon hawkish types. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3298.88s)]
*  You're seeing it really play out in this debate [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3302.1200000000003s)]
*  over the Iran nuclear talks that are happening [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3304.6400000000003s)]
*  that Steve Wicoff, the actual Secretary of State, [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3307.48s)]
*  not make-a-wish Secretary of State Marco Rubio. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3310.0s)]
*  So, I mean, it's just interesting. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3313.56s)]
*  Like that's kind of the backdrop. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3315.1200000000003s)]
*  Is these guys are still figuring out what they believe [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3316.6800000000003s)]
*  and what they're gonna do. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3318.6800000000003s)]
*  And now the Pentagon was just purged. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3319.6400000000003s)]
*  And it does feel like we're once again in a situation [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3322.28s)]
*  where maybe if this didn't break in the news [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3324.36s)]
*  was all over the place that Donald Trump [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3328.6000000000004s)]
*  might like quietly get rid of him. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3330.48s)]
*  But of course, you gotta dig in. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3332.28s)]
*  Everyone starts, now who knows? [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3334.92s)]
*  Because like there was a room, [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3336.1600000000003s)]
*  the NPR had that one source that said [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3337.6000000000004s)]
*  they're looking for someone new [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3339.28s)]
*  and that everyone fake news to death. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3340.2000000000003s)]
*  But Donald Trump. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3342.2000000000003s)]
*  But the problem with being a bunch of liars [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3343.0400000000004s)]
*  is we can't take it seriously. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3344.76s)]
*  Nobody knows. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3345.96s)]
*  And by the way, Donald. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3346.8s)]
*  He could be out by the time we are done recording this. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3347.6400000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump has said about people he fired [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3348.6800000000003s)]
*  within days, if not hours, I'm not firing this person. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3351.0s)]
*  That's true. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3354.2000000000003s)]
*  So we will see. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3355.0400000000004s)]
*  But this, Donald Trump does not like, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3355.86s)]
*  this reflects very poorly on him. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3357.4s)]
*  It looks fucking bad. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3358.92s)]
*  He's getting nothing for it. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3360.04s)]
*  Terrible press. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3361.32s)]
*  I mean, well, what he's got, yeah. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3362.1600000000003s)]
*  What he needs is if he was gonna replace him, [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3363.12s)]
*  he's gotta find someone else who can get confirmed [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3364.6800000000003s)]
*  who will be absolutely loyal to Donald Trump [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3367.88s)]
*  over the Constitution, the military, and anyone else. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3370.08s)]
*  Yeah, that clip of Hex F was so unconvincing. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3373.6800000000003s)]
*  He's like shouting at a C-Span camera. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3377.84s)]
*  He's pointing to his own children, [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3379.6s)]
*  kind of like using them as a shield [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3381.04s)]
*  for the media in that moment. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3383.1600000000003s)]
*  And he just had the look and the feel of a man [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3384.72s)]
*  who was in so far over his head [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3387.72s)]
*  and he does not know how to get out of it. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3389.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm excited for him. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3391.2799999999997s)]
*  It seems like a bad dream. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3392.6s)]
*  You're at the Easter egg roll. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3393.44s)]
*  There's a bunny next to you. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3394.3199999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump is next to you. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3395.2s)]
*  You're being asked about these terrible mistakes [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3396.2s)]
*  that you made. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3397.68s)]
*  I will, the one that- [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3398.52s)]
*  And you got your spokesman out there being like, [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3399.3399999999997s)]
*  oh, there's so much worse stories [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3400.68s)]
*  are gonna drop this week. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3403.3199999999997s)]
*  And I say that as a friend. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3404.3599999999997s)]
*  That's very real housewives, by the way. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3405.8799999999997s)]
*  As a friend, Pete, I'm telling you, you're a piece of shit. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3407.2799999999997s)]
*  But the other, yeah, the other side of it is that [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3410.16s)]
*  the more Pete Hegseth is under siege, [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3414.0800000000004s)]
*  the more loyal he'll have to be to Donald Trump, right? [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3415.8s)]
*  The more weak- [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3418.5600000000004s)]
*  My boss. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3419.4s)]
*  My boss mentality. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3420.2400000000002s)]
*  So there is that aspect of it of like, [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3421.0800000000004s)]
*  can he hold on, get to the other side of a new cycle [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3422.36s)]
*  and still be there at Trump's largesse? [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3425.0800000000004s)]
*  But just to be crystal clear, [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3427.4s)]
*  if any uniform member of the military [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3429.52s)]
*  did what Hegseth did with Signal, [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3431.76s)]
*  they would be fired if not court-martialed. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3434.1200000000003s)]
*  Any normal administration would fire him on the spot [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3436.36s)]
*  and refer to DOJ for prosecution. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3438.84s)]
*  And the fact that we're even talking about this, [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3440.7000000000003s)]
*  there's also reports that Pete Hegseth [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3442.7s)]
*  was bringing his wife to his meetings [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3444.98s)]

*  So what is strange about this is it took a few days [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3740.2s)]
*  for us to find out that the administration [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3744.66s)]
*  is claiming this as a mistake, [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3746.64s)]
*  but if it was an actual mistake, [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3747.7999999999997s)]
*  they would have known instantly, [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3749.92s)]
*  and yet they spent a week freezing the funds, [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3751.54s)]
*  then adding this new threat to tax exempt status. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3755.1s)]
*  So they went forward as if it wasn't a mistake, fine. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3758.0s)]
*  The problem with the claim that this is somehow a mistake, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3762.28s)]
*  it would imply that these demands are materially different [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3765.0400000000004s)]
*  than the demands they put on Columbia [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3767.96s)]
*  when they're really not, right? [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3769.86s)]
*  That like these- [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3771.4s)]
*  The federal oversight of admissions and hirings? [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3772.6400000000003s)]
*  The set of it, that Columbia, [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3774.96s)]
*  I don't know exactly what Columbia ended up conceding to, [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3777.48s)]
*  but those were part of the demands on Columbia, [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3779.5600000000004s)]
*  up to and including a new provost [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3781.32s)]
*  to oversee a specific department, right? [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3784.5600000000004s)]
*  Like the demands that Columbia agreed to, [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3787.28s)]
*  which is why it was so pathetic that Columbia caved, [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3790.0800000000004s)]
*  basically in the same way this does, made Trump deem. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3792.64s)]
*  They're different, they're different, [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3794.92s)]
*  but like I think it's hard to claim [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3796.48s)]
*  that these are so much more extreme [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3799.6s)]
*  than what Columbia had already agreed to. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3801.34s)]
*  I thought they were much worse, but- [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3803.68s)]
*  I think some of them are worse, [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3806.36s)]
*  some of them aren't the same, they treated them differently, [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3807.64s)]
*  but like I think Donald Trump basically demanding [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3809.76s)]
*  a private university hire a specific fucking [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3812.48s)]
*  administrative official is crazy, right? [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3815.64s)]
*  Demanding that Columbia take greater control [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3818.32s)]
*  over student groups is crazy. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3820.2s)]
*  Maybe these demands are different, [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3822.48s)]
*  but this is exactly the plan, [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3823.96s)]
*  including them then threatening the funding after. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3825.64s)]
*  So like, all right, maybe this was sent in error, [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3827.88s)]
*  maybe it was sent too quickly, [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3830.0s)]
*  but like I partly wonder if this is clean up [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3831.08s)]
*  because the blowback was so much worse than they expected [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3834.7599999999998s)]
*  and all the other schools jumped in behind Harvard [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3837.0s)]
*  after Harvard went forward. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3839.16s)]
*  But it does sound like the sourcing on the story [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3840.0s)]
*  is the administration sent the letter in error [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3841.96s)]
*  and then someone from the administration called Harvard [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3844.2799999999997s)]
*  to be like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3846.36s)]
*  to delete that, delete that, delete that. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3847.68s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3849.48s)]
*  So it's confusing. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3850.66s)]
*  I mean, we should also be clear that the grant money [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3851.5s)]
*  that's getting cut off to Harvard, [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3854.06s)]
*  it's not going to like caviar for the kids. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3855.7s)]
*  It's mostly like research for medical, [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3858.3799999999997s)]
*  cancer research, Alzheimer's research, [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3861.46s)]
*  like cutting edge scientific research. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3863.62s)]
*  This is stuff that benefits all of us. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3865.5s)]
*  Well, and it's a contract. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3866.8999999999996s)]
*  It's a government contract. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3867.74s)]
*  The government pays our best institutions [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3869.14s)]
*  to help do medical research, scientific research [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3871.14s)]
*  to benefit the country. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3874.5s)]
*  That's the whole deal. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3875.5s)]
*  Anyone else notice that one of the lawyers [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3877.94s)]
*  that Harvard hired to deal with this is Robert Herr? [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3879.26s)]
*  Sure did. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3882.1000000000004s)]
*  Coming back for the new season. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3882.94s)]
*  Do we, hey, hey, Robert Herr, listen, [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3884.1000000000004s)]
*  you know, there's a lot of things were said last year. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3888.34s)]
*  2024 was an interesting time and, you know, [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3890.0200000000004s)]
*  we can look back on it. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3892.82s)]
*  I don't think we should look back. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3893.6600000000003s)]
*  I think we should just move forward. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3894.5s)]
*  So Robert Herr getting hired by them is interesting. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3895.94s)]
*  Clearly like a, you know, very conservative lawyer, [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3899.42s)]
*  well thought of, you know, worked at DOJ for a long time. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3902.5400000000004s)]
*  Though as a choice to make Donald Trump happy [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3905.5s)]
*  is an odd one because he did not prosecute Joe Biden. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3909.62s)]
*  Right, yeah, we remember he was, [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3912.78s)]
*  he wasn't a hero on the other side either. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3913.98s)]
*  No, they hated him too. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3915.34s)]
*  Yeah, well, whatever. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3916.38s)]
*  He called him old. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3917.78s)]
*  Cool, but didn't prosecute him. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3918.94s)]
*  Which we found at the time to be ridiculous. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3920.58s)]
*  All right, before we go, we're recording this [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3925.46s)]
*  on Easter Monday, less than a day [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3926.86s)]
*  after the passing of Pope Francis. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3928.3s)]
*  Francis took a visit from JD Vance on Sunday morning. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3930.3s)]
*  Whew, talk about your last day. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3933.62s)]
*  And apparently that was enough [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3934.9s)]
*  to put the ailing pontiff over the edge [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3936.1400000000003s)]
*  after allowing himself to be photographed [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3938.26s)]
*  shaking Vance's hand. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3939.82s)]
*  The Holy Father then blessed the crowd [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3941.26s)]
*  of tens of thousands in St. Peter's Square [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3942.78s)]
*  and had one of his deputies read [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3944.9s)]
*  what would be his final Easter address [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3946.38s)]
*  in which he implicitly blasted Vance and Trump to cry and quote, [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3948.78s)]
*  how much contempt is stirred up at times [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3952.3s)]
*  towards the vulnerable, the marginalized and migrants. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3954.98s)]
*  And saying quote, I appeal to all those [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3958.46s)]
*  in positions of political responsibility in our world, [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3960.42s)]
*  not to yield to the logic of fear. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3962.98s)]
*  He also reiterated calls for a ceasefire in Gaza [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3965.1s)]
*  and a return of all the hostages [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3968.54s)]
*  and for an end to the war in Ukraine. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3970.02s)]
*  A day earlier, Vance had a longer meeting [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3972.26s)]
*  with the Pope's number two Cardinal [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3974.7400000000002s)]
*  and the Holy See's readout of that meeting mentioned quote, [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3976.18s)]
*  an exchange of opinions on quote, [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3979.42s)]
*  migrants, refugees and prisoners. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3981.3s)]
*  That topic was not in JD Vance's readout of the meeting. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3984.62s)]
*  The Pope in the past had called Trump's [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3988.94s)]
*  immigration policies quote, a disgrace and not Christian. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3990.74s)]
*  Legend. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3995.22s)]
*  What did you guys think about the Vance interaction? [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3996.9399999999996s)]
*  We're all gonna make the same joke [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=3999.06s)]
*  because we deserve this, [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4000.8999999999996s)]
*  but there's gotta be a little piece of him who thinks, [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4002.14s)]
*  did I kill the Pope? [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4005.22s)]
*  Did I kill him? [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4006.14s)]
*  Right, like that would cross my mind. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4007.22s)]
*  I think anytime spent with JD Vance does kill the vibe. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4009.2599999999998s)]
*  My mother went on, it was we didn't call it this [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4014.14s)]
*  but it was not to their faces, [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4019.14s)]
*  but it was a farewell tour to visit [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4021.22s)]
*  some of her oldest relatives before they died. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4023.5s)]
*  And we had a great uncle, Jerry. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4025.7s)]
*  And just before he died, [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4029.14s)]
*  my mother brought him a blueberry muffin [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4031.58s)]
*  and he ate the whole thing and he never been so happy. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4033.3799999999997s)]
*  He was dead in 48 hours. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4035.54s)]
*  I will say I loved this Pope, first Jesuit Pope. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4041.2599999999998s)]
*  I remember Tommy us being in the Senate office in 2005 [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4045.18s)]
*  when Benedict stepped down and Francis picked [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4049.74s)]
*  and I was like, a Jesuit from South America? [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4053.66s)]
*  Who was like all about social justice. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4057.02s)]
*  I'm like, is this real? [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4059.18s)]
*  Is the church gonna make him now [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4060.06s)]
*  now that he's gonna be Pope? [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4061.62s)]
*  Is he not gonna be like that? [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4062.54s)]
*  And he ended up being every bit the person he was [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4063.54s)]
*  when he was in South America. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4067.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I'll always call him Ratzinger, but yeah, after. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4069.62s)]
*  Ratzinger, yeah, he was a tough one. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4072.46s)]
*  I'm just like very much hoping [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4074.46s)]
*  that we don't go back to that. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4076.8599999999997s)]
*  And I don't know that anyone can fill the shoes [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4079.6600000000003s)]
*  of Pope Francis, but. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4081.38s)]
*  Still need a woke Pope. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4083.06s)]
*  We need a woke Pope. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4084.14s)]
*  We also need like one world leader insulated from politics [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4085.46s)]
*  who is willing to speak about compassion [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4089.7000000000003s)]
*  and empathy and justice in a way that, you know, [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4092.94s)]
*  JD Vance's of the world and the right [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4096.38s)]
*  will probably shit on that person, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4098.3s)]
*  but at least they can do so [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4099.9400000000005s)]
*  with some sense of moral authority. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4101.1s)]
*  Yeah, look, I'm Episcopalian, so I'm a lazy Catholic [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4103.5s)]
*  and I'll be honest. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4106.46s)]
*  I don't love the Catholic Church as an institution. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4108.14s)]
*  No, me either. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4111.9800000000005s)]
*  I don't feel like it's always been a force [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4112.820000000001s)]
*  for good in this world, [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4113.660000000001s)]
*  especially some of their social views, [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4114.700000000001s)]
*  but I think like Benedict, [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4116.860000000001s)]
*  Cardinal Ratzinger was like, he was kind of, [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4119.9800000000005s)]
*  he had that Opus Dei vibe, you know, [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4123.9800000000005s)]
*  that was when that Dan Brown book was really big. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4125.700000000001s)]
*  He had those expensive red shoes. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4127.740000000001s)]
*  Right, he was like a kind of scary guy. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4129.34s)]
*  And then Francis came along [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4131.740000000001s)]
*  and a lot of what made people love him was his tone. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4133.1s)]
*  He couldn't fully moderate the church's anti-LGBT views, [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4137.98s)]
*  but he could be decent when he talked about them. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4140.94s)]
*  As you mentioned, he cared about poverty. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4143.82s)]
*  He cared about refugees. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4145.26s)]
*  He cared about migration. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4146.5s)]
*  He cared about climate change. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4147.5s)]
*  He was a huge critic of all wars, [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4148.78s)]
*  including the war in Ukraine. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4151.54s)]
*  He helped facilitate the Cuba normalization deal [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4153.0199999999995s)]
*  between the US, the Obama administration [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4155.26s)]
*  and the Cuban government. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4157.099999999999s)]
*  So he used his office to bring about change [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4158.54s)]
*  and facilitate good works. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4162.139999999999s)]
*  And he was from the global South [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4163.58s)]
*  and I think brought that perspective to the job [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4165.3s)]
*  of understanding the horrors of colonization [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4167.860000000001s)]
*  and when great powers act in ways [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4171.46s)]
*  that are brutal and selfish. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4175.5s)]
*  And I don't know, I think we will miss him [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4177.3s)]
*  on the global stage. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4179.9400000000005s)]
*  It's a guy who washed the feet of AIDS patients [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4180.780000000001s)]
*  back when it was not a very popular thing to do. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4184.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, like there was that moment a couple of weeks ago [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4188.74s)]
*  where JD Vance was talking about [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4190.820000000001s)]
*  what the golden rule means [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4193.18s)]
*  and he seems to have not fully understood it. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4195.62s)]
*  No. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4198.0599999999995s)]
*  And there was, again, I'm so Jewish, [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4198.9s)]
*  but there was always just something beautiful [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4201.9s)]
*  about a pope that even in an institution [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4205.26s)]
*  that yes, that does not acknowledge the rights [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4207.86s)]
*  of LGBT people, that does not allow women to be priests, [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4211.42s)]
*  that he gave voice to the beautiful parts [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4214.78s)]
*  of Christian values, [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4217.18s)]
*  like the parts that everyone ought to appreciate. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4218.0199999999995s)]
*  And that is so absent from American politics, [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4220.66s)]
*  so much of the time, [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4226.38s)]
*  there is such a vicious and cruel version of Christianity [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4228.139999999999s)]
*  represented to be the one true path. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4232.18s)]
*  And then you had this pope, this undeniable pope, right? [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4233.82s)]
*  Moments before he dies telling JD Vance [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4237.42s)]
*  in not so many words to fuck off before he dies. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4239.7s)]
*  But also, the other thing he did was [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4242.9s)]
*  some people thought that he was gonna snub JD Vance. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4245.94s)]
*  That was the first thing [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4247.86s)]
*  because JD Vance got the number two the day before. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4248.7s)]
*  And then Pope Francis was like, I will meet with him. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4251.74s)]
*  It's the Vice President of the United States. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4254.5s)]
*  I will meet with him. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4255.78s)]
*  I will criticize mentally people, [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4256.62s)]
*  but because I show compassion to everyone, [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4257.82s)]
*  I'm also gonna meet the Vice President, which was nice. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4260.46s)]
*  There's this beautiful video of a young kid, [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4262.139999999999s)]
*  I don't know, he's like five, six years old, eight years old. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4266.66s)]
*  He had just lost his father [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4268.58s)]
*  and he was so nervous to ask Pope Francis a question [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4270.38s)]
*  and he goes up to him and Pope Francis [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4273.099999999999s)]
*  was like whispered in my ear. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4274.78s)]
*  He whispers it in his ear. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4276.22s)]
*  He goes and sits down and the Pope said, [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4277.18s)]
*  his father's an atheist even though he baptized [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4278.860000000001s)]
*  his three children, he wants to know [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4281.22s)]
*  if his father's gonna go to heaven. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4282.66s)]
*  And he gives this whole speech about how, [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4284.3s)]
*  he's like the God that I believe in has a father's heart [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4286.3s)]
*  and a father's heart would never want [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4288.62s)]
*  to keep his children too far away. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4290.34s)]
*  And it was like a really, [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4292.900000000001s)]
*  because the Catholic church I grew up in, [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4294.14s)]
*  you go to church and my mother was Greek Orthodox [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4296.18s)]
*  and they'd be like, if you are not Catholic, [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4298.780000000001s)]
*  do not come up for communion, sit in the bench. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4300.700000000001s)]
*  Ratzinger's like, sorry kid, he's burning. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4304.18s)]
*  No, it is, it's like that, you know, [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4305.86s)]
*  and it just being able to do that in an institution [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4307.38s)]
*  that's hard to change is laudable. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4310.139999999999s)]
*  Remember when the Pope called gay people [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4312.74s)]
*  fragguccinis though, that was funny. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4314.62s)]
*  Fragguccinos. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4316.139999999999s)]
*  You're fragguccinos. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4316.98s)]
*  I can't believe he said that. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4318.78s)]
*  I love everybody, even the fragguccinis. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4319.98s)]
*  And he's like, you can't say fragguccinis, [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4322.259999999999s)]
*  all right, I'm gonna say it one more time. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4323.86s)]
*  Fragguccinis. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4326.259999999999s)]
*  It was a real Bidenism right there. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4327.5s)]
*  It was awesome. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4328.66s)]
*  It was awesome. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4329.5s)]
*  I will say next Pope, you're right, [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4330.339999999999s)]
*  we're gonna have all the speculation of who it may be. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4331.179999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of choices out there. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4334.26s)]
*  There's one who is the, who would be like the first [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4336.26s)]
*  Asian Pope from the Philippines, [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4340.54s)]
*  and he like spoke out a lot against Duterte. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4342.26s)]
*  Probably doing horse racing. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4345.06s)]
*  Right? [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4345.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4346.820000000001s)]
*  And he would be like. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4347.66s)]
*  Where is he with the swing? [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4348.5s)]
*  Where is he with the swing cardinals? [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4349.320000000001s)]
*  Well, Tommy, I'm good. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4350.42s)]
*  And so he's like the furthest left I think he'd go. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4352.02s)]
*  But then there's, the only one that really scares me [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4354.62s)]
*  is there's one from fucking Hungary who Orban likes, [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4356.740000000001s)]
*  and conservatives all like, [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4360.26s)]
*  and he thinks that they need to like [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmdl3TbN4yA&t=4361.62s)]
