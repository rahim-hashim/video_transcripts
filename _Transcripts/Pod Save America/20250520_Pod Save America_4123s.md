Video Description: President Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer—news that lands in the middle of a media cycle already consumed with questions about Biden's decline thanks to a buzzy new book and the release and of the audio from Biden's special counsel interview. Jon, Lovett, and Tommy unpack the fallout: the questions, conspiracies, criticisms, and some truly disgusting reactions. Plus: Trump's "excellent call" with Putin,  his new attacks on the media and Kamala Harris's celebrity endorsers, and Kash Patel and Dan Bongino disappoint MAGA's conspiracist base.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Trump And MAGA Fall Into Insane Conspiracies Over Biden's Cancer Diagnosis
**Pod Save America:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0)
*  When we head towards 2028 and we're trying to nominate other presidential candidates, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=0.0s)]
*  there is a whole conversation to be had about how 2024 was handled. We've had it before. We [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3.92s)]
*  can have it again. It's okay not to have it the day after the guy gets a cancer diagnosis. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=8.08s)]
*  There's no rush. Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Jon Favreau. I'm Jon Lovett. I'm Tommy Vitor. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=13.44s)]
*  Lots to get through today. Trump's call with Putin, America's credit downgrade, Republicans making [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  even deeper Medicaid cuts, another Supreme Court ruling against Trump, Cash Patel and Dan Bongino [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=23.36s)]
*  being compromised by the deep state, and Trump lashing out at everyone from Bob Iger and Taylor [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=28.8s)]
*  Swift to Bruce Springsteen and Beyonce. But we should start with the very sad news that Joe Biden [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=42.56s)]
*  In a normal world, everyone would react to this news by sending thoughts and prayers to President [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=47.92s)]
*  Biden and his family, and that would be that. That is obviously not the world we live in. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=53.2s)]
*  Biden's diagnosis comes in the middle of a news cycle about the extent of his decline in office [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=58.56s)]
*  and his decision to run for reelection in 2024, which is chronicled in Original Sin, the new book [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=62.96s)]
*  by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson that is now out today. On Friday, the Trump administration also [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=68.48s)]
*  released the full audio of Biden's interview with special prosecutor Robert Herr as part of the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  investigation into his handling of classified material. And even though we didn't learn anything [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=79.36s)]
*  new that wasn't already in the transcript, it is striking to hear how frail and tired and sometimes [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=84.16s)]
*  confused Biden sounded. All of this is to say that when the news broke about Biden's cancer, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=90.48s)]
*  it led to all sorts of questions, conspiracies, criticisms, and some pretty gross reactions. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=96.8s)]
*  Don Jr. and plenty of other MAGA pundits have accused Biden and the First Lady of covering up [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=101.84s)]
*  the diagnosis while he was in the White House. Our old pal Dean Phillips, the Democrat who mounted [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=107.12s)]
*  a late primary challenge to Biden, told the New York Times that he doesn't think it's [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=111.84s)]
*  quote coincidental that this was announced the week that Jake and Alex's book dropped. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=116.0s)]
*  And Donald Trump, who posted an uncharacteristically supportive message wishing, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=120.56s)]
*  quote, wishing Joe a fast and successful recovery, end quote, right after the news broke, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=125.76s)]
*  changed his tune when asked about it on Monday. I think it's very sad, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=131.36s)]
*  actually. I'm surprised that it wasn't, you know, the public wasn't notified a long time ago, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=135.36s)]
*  because to get to stage nine, that's a long time. I just had my physical, you saw that, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=141.84s)]
*  you saw the results of that particular test. I think that test is standard to pretty much anybody [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  getting a physical, good physical. We had the doctors at the White House and over at Walter Reed, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=153.36s)]
*  which is a fantastic hospital. I did a very complete physical, including cognitive test, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=159.68s)]
*  I'm proud to announce. I aced it. I got them all right. The auto pen is becoming a very big [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=165.44s)]
*  deal. You know, the auto pen is becoming a big deal because it seems like that maybe was the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  president who ever operated the auto pen. But when they say that that was not good, they also, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=174.32s)]
*  you know, you have to look and you have to say that the test was not so good either. In other [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=179.76000000000002s)]
*  words, there are things going on that the public wasn't informed. And I think somebody's going to [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=184.8s)]
*  have to speak to his doctor if it's the same or even if it's two separate doctors. Why wasn't the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=189.2s)]
*  cognitive ability? Why wasn't that discussed? It's a great topic to riff on. They're just [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=195.6s)]
*  sad and terrible all around. Do you think you get hazard pay for being the military doctor [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=203.04s)]
*  has to put a finger in Trump's butt? That's how complete the physical is. Wow. It would be part [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=207.6s)]
*  of it. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. There is of course, you know, stage nine, stage four. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=212.88s)]
*  It was a Gleason score of nine. But, you know, we won't nitpick Trump's statement there. Details. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=219.92s)]
*  All right, guys, what are your reactions to both the news and the fallout so far? I already talked. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=226.0s)]
*  You can go. Yeah, obviously, it's scary and awful for his family. And I hope the treatment's [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=231.92s)]
*  effective. And I also hope the story pushes other men to get prostate exams because it's very [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=236.72s)]
*  important. I think days like this are when you wish social media never existed and didn't [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=240.72s)]
*  currently exist, right? You get the narcissist sort of saying the shittiest things they can imagine [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=246.08s)]
*  to make it about themselves and then argue with people. You have the instant experts. We got half [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  of Twitter. We have the amateur oncologists who are certain they know how to interpret the diagnosis. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=254.64s)]
*  And then you have the conspiracy folks who I would include our president, I guess, who are trying to [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=259.36s)]
*  decide if the diagnosis was covering up the Her report or the Tapper book or but they're positive [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=265.2s)]
*  it's a cover up of something. And, you know, obviously, the lack of trust here around the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=272.4s)]
*  diagnosis and with President Biden talking about his health is self-inflicted because people feel [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=277.2s)]
*  like there was a lack of candor around his health going into the reelection. One good that could [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=282.56s)]
*  come from this, I'm trying to think of something that could come from this, would be if there was [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=287.28s)]
*  some sort of reform or law that was passed that mandates some sort of independent disclosure from [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=291.44s)]
*  the president's position. Like it's a joke that we are relying on these letters from Trump's doctor [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=296.08000000000004s)]
*  that say he is the height and weight of an NFL wide receiver, right? Like I know that there's [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=301.92s)]
*  a lot of sensitivity here about a president's relationship with their position. Would that [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=307.36s)]
*  create disincentives to get care if you thought it had to be released? But I don't know. There [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  should be a form that is standardized that it goes out that tells us the health of our president [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=316.32s)]
*  or maybe even major party nominees. There are these two reactions. You see, one is a kind of [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=320.88s)]
*  performative offense and saying this diagnosis means that anyone that was critical of Biden's [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=325.76s)]
*  decision to stay in the race or anyone who believes that the conversation we need to have [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=333.68s)]
*  is being ghoulish and disgusting, which is a performance of empathy and claiming something [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=337.12s)]
*  is disgusting because you are showing that you are disgusted. And then you have on the other side [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=346.48s)]
*  I don't know, a way of proving your bona fides by demonstrating you don't have compassion as if [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=355.12s)]
*  compassion is some kind of concession to Joe Biden's politics or policies. I think that's [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=360.96s)]
*  what you see with JD Vance who it is a part of his view that the left uses emotion and empathy [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=366.88s)]
*  as a cudgel and as a weapon. And so you demonstrate your seriousness by proving that even now, even in [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=375.28s)]
*  this first 48 hours after learning this information, we need to have this conversation about Joe Biden's [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=379.91999999999996s)]
*  fitness. And to me, it's like, okay, like, is it that hard to just sort of step back and say, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=386.47999999999996s)]
*  this is a sad moment and this is a debate we still have to have, but you can also reflect on the fact [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=394.64s)]
*  that there's a human being and a family and it's a serious thing. A lot of people are going through [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=401.11999999999995s)]
*  cancer and they will see themselves in the coverage of this story and there's nothing wrong with [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=404.64s)]
*  taking a moment to be kind of circumspect about that without allowing the fact that there is a [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=408.24s)]
*  real person involved to mean we can't in the coming days, weeks and months make sure that we [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=413.68s)]
*  are learning the lessons of what happened in 2024. Yeah, I think it's also important just to go [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=419.03999999999996s)]
*  through what we know and what we've been told by oncologists and experts in the Biden family. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=425.28s)]
*  Because there are all these conspiracies out there. Did he have the cancer? Did they know about [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=433.76s)]
*  this diagnosis while he was in the White House? That is a question a lot of people are asking. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=440.08s)]
*  And some people have just decided that he obviously did, right on the right. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=445.28s)]
*  Zeke Emanuel, who's Rahm's brother and was an Obama-Biden administration official and [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=450.8s)]
*  is a specialist in breast cancer, so he's an oncologist, I'm not prostate. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=458.56s)]
*  He said, he's like, oh, there's no doubt that a cancer this aggressive has been there for a [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=464.24s)]
*  while and Joe Biden had it while he was in the White House. Well, that can be true, but also [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=469.12s)]
*  he could not have known about the diagnosis. And in fact, men over 70 often don't get the prostate [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=474.96s)]
*  exam. They just don't test them for that, partly because they're getting up an age and if they [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=480.96s)]
*  find one cancer, then they might have to treatment and the treatment may be worse. There's a whole [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=487.6s)]
*  series of medical explanations. Benjamin Mazur, who's a physician, wrote in the Atlantic Today, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=491.84000000000003s)]
*  he said, it's not surprising, he said, that this happened because many cancers have just discovered [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=496.72s)]
*  out of the blue. We talked to someone, our producer has a friend who's an oncologist at Sloan Kettering, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=504.32000000000005s)]
*  who said, yeah, they just wouldn't have tested for that. Now you can ask, well, he's the president [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=511.76000000000005s)]
*  of the United States, why wouldn't they have tested him for that? But it's not completely [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=515.76s)]
*  surprising. My view on all the discussion, the diagnosis is I'll pass. I don't know. And I'm [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=519.84s)]
*  not going to judge and I'm not asking you to take the White House's word for it. And I'm not asking [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=524.72s)]
*  you to, I'm not trying to disabuse anyone. I just think like if Biden was trying to spin away damaging [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=529.04s)]
*  reports about his health, I'm not sure releasing a cancer diagnosis would be the most effective [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=534.88s)]
*  tactic. I think people should just investigate that theory of the case. Yeah, I want to say that. I [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=538.8s)]
*  have no idea either, right? Like nothing at this point would surprise me about anything, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=543.36s)]
*  but you just have to like think to yourself. It's a little illogical. Yeah. So the nodule was found [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=547.6800000000001s)]
*  six days ago. There were reports about that. It was last week that there was a nodule and they [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=553.2s)]
*  were going to test further, right? So they released the information that there was a nodule found in [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=556.64s)]
*  an exam. Then six days later they had the biopsy and they gave us the results. Also remember, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=560.64s)]
*  I forgot about this, but in February of 23, he had a cancerous lesion on his chest. He had a [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=565.04s)]
*  basal cell carcinoma that was removed and that was immediately released and told everyone. So [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=570.24s)]
*  it just, I don't know why you would cover up your cancer diagnosis to keep serving as opposed to [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=576.32s)]
*  just getting treatment right away for your aggressive cancer. Yeah. What treatment? It also sounds [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=582.16s)]
*  like the White House is trying to use this as a pretext to invalidate things that Joe Biden did, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=586.5600000000001s)]
*  because they're suggesting that having undiagnosed or diagnosed prostate cancer means you thus use [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=591.52s)]
*  the auto pen more often. He's just using it as a hook. He's using it as a hook to get back to his [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=597.04s)]
*  claim that, you know, that worst case, right? Let's say we learn actually Joe Biden was diagnosed [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=601.28s)]
*  with cancer and didn't tell anybody and that's terrible. That doesn't make him more or less fit [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=605.8399999999999s)]
*  to do the job while, I mean, it would certainly be an indictment on his decision to run again, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=609.68s)]
*  but it has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not he was copus mentis and signing the [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=613.68s)]
*  documents. Right. But this is why you have to just dig like an inch into this before you're like, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=617.1999999999999s)]
*  the prostate, no one is suggesting that the prostate cancer has anything to do with decline [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=623.04s)]
*  or making you unable to like, that's, that's not what people are suggesting, right? He's flailing. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=628.8s)]
*  Yeah. It's just, I think, look, it's an entirely separate conversation that people were having [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=633.84s)]
*  before this diagnosis about his decision to run again and potential decline over the last couple [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=638.9599999999999s)]
*  years in the White House for sure. But like not everything has to be connected. Not everything [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=644.0s)]
*  has to be connected and not everything has to be about the set of issues or topics you're [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=648.88s)]
*  interested in and talking about every single day. And you know, and, and I just like this idea that [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=653.36s)]
*  like you, that you prove how assured you are and powerful and strong you are in your views by like [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=658.24s)]
*  saying like, you know, every, I'm going to piss on Joe Biden's grave. That's how much I care about [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=665.68s)]
*  Gaza. It's like, what are you fucking talking about? Like, what does that prove? What does that prove [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=670.64s)]
*  to anybody? Right. And again, like there is a, especially as when we head towards 2028 and we're [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=674.0s)]
*  trying to nominate the presidential candidate, there is a whole conversation to be had about how [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=680.8s)]
*  2024 was handled. We've had it before. We can have it again. It's okay not to have it the day after [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=684.4s)]
*  the guy gets a cancer diagnosis. There's no, there's no rush. Yes. I think that's right. And also there [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=689.28s)]
*  is a, like a certain kind of like, it reminds me of when, whenever there were like mass shootings, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=694.56s)]
*  there would be this kind of clutch of conservatives that would be like, how dare you talk about gun [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=699.12s)]
*  control. The bodies are not yet buried you ghouls. And there was a strain of that on the left of like [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=702.8s)]
*  trying to basically like silence views they already disagreed with that have been kind of [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=707.92s)]
*  beating their chest about for weeks before this. Yeah. I have no, the, the like, why are we talking [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=711.92s)]
*  about this when we should be talking about that takes driving me crazy. It's like we can do both. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=717.8399999999999s)]
*  There's unlimited tweets. It doesn't come with a cap of governor. But also it does bring out the [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=722.0799999999999s)]
*  performative edgelords like you are referencing there. I love it. And it's usually from people [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=727.8399999999999s)]
*  who are trying to build an audience on the back of their self-righteous preening about a cause [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=732.08s)]
*  that is very important, but will in no way be advanced by whatever it is. They're actually [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=736.5600000000001s)]
*  saying in that moment. And I'm not trying to tone police. Anyone like say what that will say what [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=740.72s)]
*  you want about politicians. We certainly do, but like the people who live on the internet, I think [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=744.24s)]
*  get used to speaking about other human beings in a way that is dehumanizing and detached from reality [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=750.08s)]
*  and that they would never say in person. And you end up saying things that I think chip away at [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=756.24s)]
*  your soul and your humanity. And I would just ask, like look inward, say whatever the fuck you want. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=761.36s)]
*  I don't care. You do you also like, come on. Humans are complicated and life is complicated. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=766.88s)]
*  And it is completely okay to say that you are genuinely sorry for someone and hope that they [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=772.5600000000001s)]
*  recover and are wishing them the best and have deep disagreements with their policies or their [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=778.48s)]
*  behavior. That's okay. It's possible to do all of those things. Yeah. By the way, like I feel that [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=783.6800000000001s)]
*  conflict like I have made just, just, I have made some pretty awful jokes today, but just to get [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=787.76s)]
*  them out before we start recording. Jesus. Deal with it. You heard him. You laughed. It's all right. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=794.24s)]
*  I'm not going to share him just for us. Now you get the, you get the downside of people knowing [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=800.72s)]
*  you make jokes without the upside of them hearing the funny. That's where the best, that's where the [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=804.96s)]
*  best. I don't know how big that upside is. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Same, same. I don't know what you're talking about. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=808.48s)]
*  Oh yeah. All right. Let's talk about Biden's successor, who is the president. He had a newsie [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=814.16s)]
*  Monday Trump announced in a truth social post that he'd just concluded a two hour phone call [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=818.7199999999999s)]
*  with Vladimir Putin. And that the result was that Russia and Ukraine will now begin peace negotiations. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=823.52s)]
*  Though he didn't offer any real details. He just went on about the U S doing lots of business in [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=829.4399999999999s)]
*  Russia and in Ukraine. Once the war is over, that's what's important. Ending the post, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=834.0s)]
*  let the process begin. Tommy, what's your, what's your sense of how real this is? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=839.12s)]
*  I mean, I mean, my takeaway was that he was just kind of wiping his hands of the whole thing, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=844.64s)]
*  being like, all right, you guys, uh, he's gone from, I will end the war in 24 hours to you guys figure [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=849.5999999999999s)]
*  it out. Maybe the Vatican can help. Maybe JD will come over again. I don't really care what he's up [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=854.56s)]
*  to, but do you. Um, and then if you read the Putin readout, he is talking about the need to quote, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=859.04s)]
*  eliminate the root causes of this crisis, which is code for him regurgitating all his [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=865.12s)]
*  maximalist demands, like denazification of the Ukrainian government, uh, territorial demands. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=869.12s)]
*  I mean, he wants to, uh, the Russians attended at a much lower level, a set of peace talks with [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=874.5600000000001s)]
*  Ukraine in Istanbul last week. And basically they're saying we want to continue to occupy [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=880.32s)]
*  and fully control the 20% of Ukrainian territory. So, you know, it's just, it's just, we're noting [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=885.12s)]
*  that like Trump has not ended the war in Ukraine. Things are actually worse because we've not sent [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=890.96s)]
*  them additional military funding. The Russians are, you know, watching these barrages of missiles [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=896.08s)]
*  and drones every single night. They're killing civilians every single night. When you look at [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=901.6s)]
*  Gaza, things are as bad there, uh, if not worse than they've ever been. Gaza has been under siege [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=905.2s)]
*  for two months. The airstrikes are relentless. The IDF is now starting a ground invasion. So, uh, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=910.24s)]
*  he solved none of the international problems he told us he would solve within hours of taking off. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=914.96s)]
*  It's, uh, you know, you're Pope Leo, you're still figuring out how your email works, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=920.4s)]
*  still figuring out which is the best bathroom to use when you're on your way to the office. And you [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=924.48s)]
*  get, you're like, I'm sorry, what am I supposed to solve for you now? It is amazing, right? He said, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=927.76s)]
*  I can solve this in 24 hours. Then he said, Oh, that was just hyperbole, but I'm still the one to [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=931.92s)]
*  solve it. He does a two hour phone call, two hour phone call. He comes out of, he's like, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=937.28s)]
*  geez, this is fucking complicated. He actually says like, honestly, they need to work it out [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=941.6s)]
*  themselves because some of this stuff is so complicated. Only they know the details. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=945.36s)]
*  And maybe the Vatican can handle it. Just throw it like, I just, that is wild. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=948.48s)]
*  It's like when he, uh, you know, the only pressure he's got, Putin has gotten from Trump is [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=952.4s)]
*  Vladimir stop. Yeah. One tweet in a, yeah. In a true social post from a couple of weeks ago. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=957.84s)]
*  That's so that I don't know why Putin would really change his behavior. Yeah. Start. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=962.32s)]
*  And, uh, and just the other part of it too, is that right? There's a word that Vladimir Putin [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=967.36s)]
*  started. The only reason Ukraine has been able to survive is because of us backing. He, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=970.96s)]
*  Donald Trump is not saying that the U S will continue to support Ukraine until there's peace. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=976.08s)]
*  He's not saying anything to show that he would have Ukraine's, Ukraine's back. That's a great [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=980.8000000000001s)]
*  sign for Putin. Who's now making these outrageous demands. So he's just giving up the game and [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=985.6800000000001s)]
*  walking away. Do we think the fact that Zelensky and, um, JD Vance met without JD Vance screaming [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=988.96s)]
*  at him, uh, at the, uh, at the Pope's inaugural mass is a, is a good sign. Maybe I'd kind of doubt [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=996.24s)]
*  it though. I mean, I do think they're going to walk away. I mean, Marco Rubio has been saying [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1001.84s)]
*  this for a couple of days. It's like, well, they won't, you know, get serious and start these talks [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1004.96s)]
*  and we're just going to move on to things that are more important. It's like, well, have you tried [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1008.32s)]
*  pressuring both sides and not just the Ukrainian side that might help things. Vance also called it, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1011.36s)]
*  I think it's on the plane today. He called it, uh, Biden's war, uh, which is I think a really, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1016.08s)]
*  uh, dispiriting, uh, sign. Yeah. Certainly one thing you can't pin on Biden. Today's presenting sponsor [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1021.0400000000001s)]

*  the US's credit rating, citing our country's rising deficit. Collect them all. Fitch, we got the Fitch [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1175.36s)]

*  eat the tariffs in a true social screed where he warned the company, quote, I'll be watching. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1203.76s)]

*  experts. We went through something similar in the Obama administration in 2011. Yeah, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1248.48s)]
*  I think we've revealed ourselves to be experts on it. Look, I don't. It's what the impact is of a [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1256.16s)]
*  specific ratings downgrade. Like it's not a surprise that the House Republicans are on a path to [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1262.48s)]

*  not the US is a reliable country to lend money to? But I do think it's part of a bigger problem, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1277.6s)]
*  which is Donald Trump is just spending our credibility. He's just spending it. And [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1284.56s)]
*  we have some protection from the fact that we are an incredibly wealthy country, that we have a lot [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1291.04s)]
*  of goodwill, that we have a lot of countries that have trusted us for a long time, and it's very [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1298.24s)]
*  difficult to unwind a relationship with the United States in a variety of ways, whether you're a [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1301.6799999999998s)]
*  business or a country, but it's imperiling us in the long term. And I think we talk a lot about [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1305.44s)]
*  the chaos that Donald Trump has caused and the volatility that Donald Trump has caused. But [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1311.1200000000001s)]
*  what we're seeing Republicans do right now is the same thing that they've done for decades, which is [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1316.88s)]
*  clamor about deficits, clamor about debt. Well, but when they get into power, they [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1322.56s)]
*  pass massive tax cuts. They don't want to pay for them, and they leave the mess for others to clean [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1327.44s)]
*  up in the hopes that it forces cuts to government spending by more responsible people that'll come [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1331.36s)]
*  later. And what this downgrade says, what a lot of experts say is there's only so long you can do [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1337.52s)]
*  that. You can't do that forever. We are not in a financial crisis right now. We are not in a moment [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1342.08s)]
*  where we need the government to spend a vast amount of money to prop up the economy in an emergency, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1347.1999999999998s)]
*  but that could come, that could come, and it'll be harder and worse if we are living in a deficit [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1352.4799999999998s)]
*  created by massive tax cuts for the rich. And the other part of it that I do think is important is [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1357.44s)]
*  it's another, we are, like Republicans took this information and started lying about it. So you [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1361.76s)]
*  have Steve Scalise, who's right now one of the people running point to pass this massive [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1367.04s)]
*  reconciliation bill that will balloon the deficit by $3 trillion. And he's saying this moody's [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1372.0800000000002s)]
*  downgrade is a reminder about why we have to pass this bill. We have to get our fiscal house in [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1376.56s)]
*  order, which is exactly what we're trying to do. And so he is just going out to the cameras and [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1380.88s)]
*  fucking lying about what they're doing. Yeah. I mean, I'm personally a Fitch guy. So [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1384.48s)]
*  what Moody's is doing is they are looking at the credit worthiness of the U S government to pay back [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1391.6s)]
*  debt. And I guess Scott Besson doesn't think the slide from AAA to AA one is a big deal, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1396.88s)]
*  but in practice, riskier bonds have to pay higher yields, which means they cost us more [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1403.92s)]
*  to issue. And I think the 30 year treasury is now over 5%. So it'll cost the United States more to [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1408.4s)]
*  borrow money. And that also pushes up the benchmark that is used for banks when they issue mortgages [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1413.04s)]
*  or car loans. So just going to make everything more expensive for everyone. And certain financial [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1418.3999999999999s)]
*  institutions or pension funds can only invest in the lowest risk assets. And that can have a ripple [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1423.84s)]
*  effect. And I think right now the annual cost of servicing the U S debt, like the interest payments [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1429.68s)]
*  we pay on our debt is $952 billion in 2025. Like our debt is really expensive right now. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1435.68s)]
*  It is a very, very bad situation. I think. Right. The downgrade itself, what's the impact of that? [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1443.44s)]
*  Who knows. But it reflects a growing problem, which is we are going to borrow more money and [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1449.5200000000002s)]
*  it's going to cost us more to borrow more money as people doubt whether or not in the long run, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1454.0800000000002s)]
*  they can trust us to be a country that repays our debts. Especially when you have all of these sort [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1457.3600000000001s)]
*  of right wing kind of intellectuals running around claiming there's a secret method to Donald Trump's [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1461.3600000000001s)]
*  madness. And there's going to be something like the Mar-a-Lago records and he's going to try to [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1466.16s)]
*  downgrade, you know, get, get a deal on our debt and downgrade our debt to kind of [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1470.64s)]
*  do this massive realignment and all this crap and all of it adds up to more good rates being higher. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1475.2s)]
*  So on the Walmart thing, it seems like Trump's strategy to deal with the higher prices that are [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1481.1200000000001s)]
*  directly related to his trade war is going to be to just blame U S companies. How well do you think [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1487.1200000000001s)]
*  that'll work? It's a lot of phone calls. So I think there's like two, so there's the just sort of [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1493.44s)]
*  like kind of obscene, like hypocrisy of Republicans claiming that Democrats are going to do price [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1499.8400000000001s)]
*  controls and Donald Trump trying to kind of browbeaten buttonhole these companies and keeping [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1506.8s)]
*  their prices lower. But this is the kind of thing where if Walmart does pass on the price to [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1510.96s)]
*  consumers, that's terrible for consumers. That's just a terrible thing. It's a self-inflicted wound. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1516.72s)]
*  It makes life worse for the American people. It raises costs when he promised lower cost. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1520.64s)]
*  But let's say it works. Let's say he does successfully bully some giant companies into [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1524.0s)]
*  eating some of the costs because they can afford to do it. Great. What about the small companies [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1529.3600000000001s)]
*  that can't do that? What about all the companies that are going to deal with the rising cost of [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1533.2s)]
*  tariffs that don't have the market power of a Walmart or an Amazon to go to the suppliers [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1537.04s)]
*  and kind of force them to eat the cost? They'll just be at a greater disadvantage to the big [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1541.6000000000001s)]
*  companies than what they already were kind of dealing with for years, if not decades. So to me, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1545.68s)]
*  this is just like there's no winning. They do what he says we lose. They don't do what he says we [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1551.36s)]
*  lose. It just seems completely impractical. I mean, you can't do this every time someone has [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1556.1599999999999s)]
*  to increase the price of something because of a tariff. What are you talking about? Also, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1560.56s)]
*  I saw people suggesting that what Trump is doing here is the same as what Democrats were saying [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1564.1599999999999s)]
*  during COVID about companies price gouging. I was waiting for someone to make that point. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1568.08s)]
*  I hadn't seen that. I saw it everywhere. I was waiting for that. Except guys, in this case, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1572.24s)]
*  the government took an action, in this case, tariffs that is causing prices to go up. And [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1575.6799999999998s)]
*  Trump is saying, okay, you eat the costs, Walmart or whatever. Whereas during COVID, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1580.88s)]
*  prices went up because of supply chain disruptions. And then the supply chain [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1585.68s)]
*  disruptions went away. But the prices stayed up. So Democrats said, you're price gouging. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1589.1200000000001s)]
*  They're very different things, in my view. Yeah. And the big difference in the first one was [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1593.2800000000002s)]
*  it happened everywhere in the world. Right. And this is just solely due to Donald Trump, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1598.0800000000002s)]
*  who by the way, I remember hearing from him and everyone in the administration, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1602.88s)]
*  that tariffs are not taxes on anyone in the US. Tariffs are just about hitting China with tariffs [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1607.44s)]
*  or hitting other countries that are ripping us off. And they're going to have to pay, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1614.8s)]
*  and these other countries are paying us so much. But I guess now Trump is acknowledging that it is [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1617.68s)]
*  a tax on US companies. And when you raise taxes on US companies, they're either going to respond by [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1621.3600000000001s)]
*  cutting into their profits, not hiring as many people or raising prices. Or probably some [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1628.56s)]
*  combination of all three of those things. Yeah. The suppliers will bear some of the costs. The [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1634.48s)]
*  companies like Walmart will bear some of the costs and consumers will bear some of the costs. What's [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1640.4s)]
*  the ratio going to be? I don't know. That's what Becson's basically admitting, that that's the only [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1644.24s)]
*  way that this can go. And we don't know how it will shake out. Do I think it's probably a little bit [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1647.3600000000001s)]
*  effective for Donald Trump to yell at these companies? Probably. But somebody's going to [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1652.64s)]
*  pay. It's going to happen. Yeah. And I think in terms of voters, I don't think that voters are [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1657.28s)]
*  suddenly going to be like, oh yeah, Walmart's really screwing us right now. Everyone knows [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1662.8s)]
*  about the trade war. Trump has made it his signature economic policy. And he has the power to [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1666.6399999999999s)]
*  lower the prices by ending the tariffs. I don't remember Joe Biden getting a lot of largesse when [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1673.44s)]
*  prices were up because of a once in a generation, once in a century global pandemic. People hold [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1678.8s)]
*  the administration accountable for the economy. Also, I think this became public because the CEO [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1684.08s)]
*  or someone at the company said it during an earnings call. Yeah. Right. So the CEO has to [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1689.52s)]
*  disclose this on a quarterly earnings call. Donald Trump calls, yells at him and says, oh yes sir, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1694.8799999999999s)]
*  of course sir, no problem sir. And then a week or two later, he just quietly raised prices. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1698.8s)]
*  Right. Don't announce it. Give me a break. They're a corporation. Yeah. One thing that certainly [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1702.56s)]
*  won't help bring down deficits or prices, Trump's big beautiful bill that finally passed the House [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1707.36s)]
*  Budget Committee after Republicans made it worse in order to appease the hardliners in their caucus [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1711.6s)]
*  who had blocked the bill from moving forward last week. They basically, the changes are they moved [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1716.72s)]
*  up the timeline to kick people off Medicaid. They increased some fees for people on Medicaid [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1721.8400000000001s)]
*  and they cut even more clean energy investments that Biden had passed and Democrats. Of course, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1727.2s)]
*  the hardliners say they're still not happy. So negotiations are continuing, though the House [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1733.44s)]
*  is still aiming to pass this thing by Memorial Day. Trump's apparently going to be meeting with [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1739.2800000000002s)]
*  congressional Republicans at the Capitol on Tuesday as you're listening to this. So I want [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1743.76s)]
*  to know what happened to all those House Republicans and competitive districts who were worried about [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1749.52s)]
*  Medicaid cuts. They just going to swallow all these changes now? They should remain worried. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1753.2s)]
*  I mean, there's a CNN poll the other day that 76% opposed major spending cuts in Medicaid. That [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1758.72s)]
*  includes 79% of independents and 55% of Republicans. And the reason is, 60% of Democrats and Republicans [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1763.44s)]
*  were on Medicaid or knew someone close to them who are on Medicaid. It's a very personal thing [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1772.08s)]
*  for people. Yeah, four Republicans voted present, which would be enough Republicans to sink it. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1776.1599999999999s)]
*  Those are the hardliners, but those would be enough to sink it on the House floor. Right now, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1781.04s)]
*  it is a like you had Massey posting earlier today about just how much this adds to the debt. He's [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1788.1599999999999s)]
*  saying it adds, I think he said 10 trillion. It's like, that's like a, that's double even what the [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1794.8s)]
*  estimates would be if you fully extended it, but whatever. The fact that it's $3.3 trillion in [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1800.16s)]
*  deficits before you add the, what happens if you extend the provisions they sunset, which means [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1804.8s)]
*  they've written this bill to claim it only adds over 3 trillion to the debt over years. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1811.28s)]
*  But in reality, they have a bunch of stuff that just goes away after three or four years, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1816.72s)]
*  because they assume political pressure will force it to be extended in the future, just like what [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1820.56s)]
*  they're trying to do. Now, if you add that, it's, I think over $6 trillion in deficit, all of which [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1824.3200000000002s)]
*  basically is extending the Trump tax cuts paid for in part by cutting Medicaid dramatically and [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1830.4s)]
*  accelerating the cuts to the Inflation Reduction Act, which are a bunch of clean energy projects, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1836.64s)]
*  many of which are actually already happening, right? Like they're coming in to say, to stop [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1840.72s)]
*  projects that are or to disincentivize projects that are already happening. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1844.48s)]
*  It's such a farce because say they get this through the House, they're going to get it over [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1848.88s)]
*  to the Senate. Senate Republicans are not going to be able to pass a bill that's as crazy [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1853.52s)]
*  as this one because they have people like Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski in their caucus. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1859.12s)]
*  And so I think the real question comes when whatever the Senate passes, they're going to [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1863.52s)]
*  send it back to the House and try to jam the House. And then are you going to get people like [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1867.52s)]
*  Chip Roy and some of these hardliners to just say, sure, I'll take it because Donald Trump yells at [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1872.32s)]
*  them? Or are they going to be like, no, fuck off? I mean, if I was betting, I bet on them passing [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1877.6s)]
*  something because I just the risk of catastrophic failure of getting nothing done legislatively, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1882.08s)]
*  of Donald Trump sort of being on the hook for the tax breaks expiring and thus everyone getting a [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1888.8s)]
*  tax increase. He seemed a little bit disengaged so far. I would imagine he will go ham on these [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1896.1599999999999s)]
*  guys at some point in the near future. Here's what I don't know how you square. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1902.56s)]
*  The Chip Roy's of the world, they've been extremely clear about what they want. They [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1907.04s)]
*  have never wavered. They have been honest and direct about what they expect. They've never [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1911.44s)]
*  said otherwise. And this bill dramatically increases the deficit without enough cuts. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1915.6s)]
*  Then you have the salt people that I'm sorry, but you do have the Roy boys and the salt people. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1920.8799999999999s)]
*  You got the Roy boys and the salt people and the salt people know that if the Trump tax cuts expire, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1926.1599999999999s)]
*  the salt credits go back up. So it really is like an impossible political situation that I [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1930.7199999999998s)]
*  guess they get to yes on by just creating a ramming down their throats. But I don't, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1936.7199999999998s)]
*  what I don't understand is I can see how you can get yeses from the moderates by basically having [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1944.0s)]
*  it balloon the deficit more. That's how you get them. You get rid of some of the negative politics [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1949.12s)]
*  around Medicaid and some of these other cuts and you can get them back. I just don't know how you [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1953.4399999999998s)]
*  get enough of the right wingers back. That's what I don't understand. Yeah, I don't either. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1957.9199999999998s)]
*  And they're just going to be taking heat from a bunch of people on the right who are saying this [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1960.8799999999999s)]
*  is going to add trillions to the deficit. And then Democrats who are going to rightly be saying [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1964.56s)]
*  millions of people are going to lose their health insurance so that you can give, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1969.84s)]
*  make sure that people with estates over $30 million can pass on their estate tax free to their heirs. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1974.56s)]
*  I mean, and give like an average of a million dollars in tax cut to small business owners who [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1982.72s)]
*  were doing pass throughs. You have Holly, by the way, saying he's against any Medicaid cuts. He's [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1989.84s)]
*  on the record. He'll do whatever. He'll say anything. But I don't know how you get to a yes [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1995.28s)]
*  on him. And the other part of it, too, is it is amazing how much it is just pure greed because [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=1999.76s)]
*  they could just extend the middle class Trump tax cuts. Like there is a popular version. I mean, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2004.4s)]
*  it would still be unpopular because of the cuts, but there is a less egregious version of this on [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2008.32s)]
*  the politics and on the merits. But they just will not entertain it. They will not change the [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2012.48s)]
*  truth of the talking point that they are going to give a trillion dollars in tax cuts just to the [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2018.56s)]
*  top 1% of people in this country, people who make over a million dollars, a trillion dollars goes to [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2025.28s)]
*  them while they kick over 10 million people off their health insurance. Yeah, the CBO says by 2034, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2030.08s)]
*  it could kick between 9.7 and 14.4 million people off of their health care. So that's pretty terrible. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2036.08s)]
*  And also this bill, like these guys, when they get a tax bill in front of them, they just can't help [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2042.16s)]
*  larding it up with whatever special interest bullshit came before them. Right. So only 10% [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2046.56s)]
*  of tax filers actually itemized their deductions, but they're loading this thing up with new [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2051.2s)]
*  deductions, including a billion dollar tax break for gun silencers. Very important. There's up to [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2054.96s)]
*  a $10,000 deduction for car loan interest payments available to people who buy cars, vans, campers, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2061.04s)]
*  RVs, ATVs, and motorcycles. And then there's ATVs in there. This is a Trump campaign promise. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2066.32s)]
*  And then there's a multinational corporations could get an $800 million tax cut on income [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2071.92s)]
*  in the Virgin Islands. So lots of good stuff in here for everybody. If you want to help with [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2076.8s)]
*  pressure on those Republicans with tough races in 26, who will be voting on the bill, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2080.0s)]
*  sign up for vote, save America. You can go to the website. We have plenty of opportunities for [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2085.28s)]
*  people to get involved. Very important. All right. Quick update on Trump's war on the constitution and [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2090.24s)]
*  due process. On Friday, the Supreme Court extended its hold on the administration's use of the alien [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2096.4s)]
*  enemies act to deport people without them being able to challenge their removal. Only Thomas and [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2101.84s)]
*  Alito dissented on process grounds, but the decision affirmed that even undocumented immigrants [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2106.8s)]
*  have due process rights. And one of those rights is being given sufficient warning. Here's a key [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2112.6400000000003s)]
*  quote from the ruling, quote, notice roughly 24 hours before removal, devoid of information about [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2118.6400000000003s)]
*  how to exercise due process rights to contest that removal surely does not pass muster. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2124.0800000000004s)]
*  Trump responded with a truth social post and all caps saying the Supreme Court won't allow us to [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2130.4s)]
*  get criminals out of our country. He also reposted a suggestion from one of his advisors, Mike Davis, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2135.28s)]
*  saying that the Supreme Court's ruling is, quote, illegal and that the president should, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2142.1600000000003s)]
*  quote, house these foreign terrorists near the Chevy Chase Country Club with daytime release. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2146.32s)]
*  That is a country club in Maryland where both John Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh belong. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2152.4s)]
*  So the court is- No bad ideas in the bridge. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2157.52s)]
*  The court isn't stopping Trump from deporting criminals or deporting any non-citizens so long [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2159.12s)]
*  as the administration follows the law and provides due process. Why do you think that Trump and Steven [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2168.4s)]
*  Miller and Mike Davis and the rest of the goons just continue to lie about that? So the Cato [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2173.3599999999997s)]
*  Institute, not a bunch of squishy libs over there, pretty conservative organization, they published [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2178.72s)]
*  a review of the 240 or so Venezuelans the US sent to prison in El Salvador. They found 50 of them [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2183.44s)]
*  came to the US legally, never violated any immigration law, but were sent there anyway. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2190.08s)]
*  I think that speaks to the reality of the MAGA immigration project, which is to get rid of [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2195.6s)]
*  legal immigrants, people welcomed here as refugees, people seeking asylum, people granted TPS, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2200.32s)]
*  because it's not about gangs, it's not about bad apples, it's not about people who broke the law. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2205.92s)]
*  The policy is that white people from South Africa can come and be refugees and everyone else has to [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2209.76s)]
*  go home and all of this rhetoric is an extension of that. Yeah, it's the fact that they could pursue [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2215.36s)]
*  under what the court has already said, what every district and circuit court has already said, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2225.44s)]
*  a plan of mass deportations. They want to force this specific issue. Steve Bannon has been talking [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2229.36s)]
*  about this. All these guys are talking about they want to force the constitutional crisis. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2237.84s)]
*  They want an opportunity to violate a Supreme Court order. Who knows, but it seems to me to be [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2241.76s)]
*  in service of some kind of a round of deportations that allows them to grab tens of thousands, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2248.2400000000002s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of people without them ever seeing a judge, without them ever having [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2256.96s)]
*  to deal with the ramifications of it. I don't know how else you can make sense of it other than to [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2260.7200000000003s)]
*  think that that's where they want to take us. Yeah, there were a lot of calls again for what [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2267.2s)]
*  Stephen Miller suggested last week, two weeks ago, I can't remember, suspending habeas corpus. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2271.8399999999997s)]
*  Mike Davis was tweeting about this because he was on Steve Bannon's, he was on the war room with [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2277.6s)]
*  Steve Bannon and they were both talking about specifically they should do it. The administration [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2281.7599999999998s)]
*  has got to do right at the end of June when the Supreme Court justices after they go home for a [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2285.4399999999996s)]
*  couple months and let's you know let's suspend habeas corpus in this country. Do you guys see [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2290.0s)]
*  that LA Times story that had more details about the people who are going to get sent to Libya? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2296.0s)]
*  So there was a Vietnamese construction worker who has lived in LA for decades with his wife and [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2301.76s)]
*  teenage daughter. I think he had you know years and years and years ago some criminal conviction on [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2308.88s)]
*  his record. Same thing, there was another Filipino who was told he was going to go back to the [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2313.92s)]
*  Philippines and be deported there. He was in detention as well and these people were so the [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2320.0s)]
*  construction worker he showed up at his immigration check-in as he regularly does because he wants to [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2325.84s)]
*  follow the the rules and the laws that are here and he goes there they detain him, they send him [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2332.32s)]
*  to Texas and then they tell him wake up you're going to go to Libya. He's like what? The lawyer [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2339.04s)]
*  was like so confused even one of the correction officers when the lawyer called was like that [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2345.44s)]
*  can't be, that can't be. Libya? And they were going to send all of these people, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2349.36s)]
*  most of them Asian nationals, Cambodia, Philippines, Vietnamese to Libya for to just rot away in some [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2356.2400000000002s)]
*  detention center run by a warlord in eastern Libya. Yeah it's as if they just sit around they [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2365.36s)]
*  think what is the cruelest thing we could possibly do? What's the scary, I mean I think a lot of it is [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2371.36s)]
*  that this is their idea of a deterrent. I was going to say- [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2376.08s)]
*  We're going to send people to Libya but Libya is not really a nation governed by any political entity [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2378.56s)]
*  right now. It's like split in half, there's competing warlords, there's weapons everywhere, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2383.92s)]
*  there's extremist groups, like these people would all get killed. And to that study that you [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2388.8s)]
*  talked about Tommy, like those people came here via a port of entry which you're supposed to do [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2393.44s)]
*  when you claim asylum. You come, you see the officers say I'm here to claim asylum or they [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2399.6s)]
*  had an appointment or they already had refugee status in some cases, they were already approved [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2403.68s)]
*  to be refugees or somewhat one of them at least was here on a tourist visa. These are the people [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2409.68s)]
*  that got sent to CICOT. The people showing up for their appointments and then being grabbed, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2414.48s)]
*  being ruled so dangerous they can't be let out again, even though they were free and in between [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2420.64s)]
*  appointments they'd already had, they already touched the federal government. And then not [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2424.96s)]
*  just being deported but sent to a foreign jail of some kind or prison or detention facility. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2428.4s)]
*  I think the Supreme Court acknowledged this and the fact that they are being sent to foreign [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2435.12s)]
*  prisons from which the government by its own admission has no ability to kind of seek any [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2438.88s)]
*  recourse raises the stakes even further. Donald Trump is claiming that he has secured the border, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2443.52s)]
*  that the border is now we have locked it up, Joe Biden left it open, I've locked it up, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2449.52s)]
*  and they were under the threat- And he's right about that by the way. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2453.84s)]
*  Yeah. There's zero border crossings happening basically. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2456.96s)]
*  And we're in the middle of an invasion despite the fact that the border is closed. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2460.16s)]
*  And there are people that are so dangerous that even though we know who they are and they are free [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2464.64s)]
*  in our country, once they come and talk to us we will grab them and ship them off to a foreign [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2472.7200000000003s)]
*  prison without recourse even though they no longer have the ability to get back in the country [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2477.44s)]
*  because the border is closed if we deport them. It's in one of these cases that [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2483.04s)]
*  we deport people and then the court rules they need to be brought back and they can fly back. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2491.04s)]
*  You can go and buy a plane ticket and you can fly back or the government can fly you back. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2495.2s)]
*  The idea that these people that may have been here undocumented or may have been [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2500.8s)]
*  seeking some kind of refugee or asylum status are then not just being deported, [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2505.52s)]
*  not just being deported to a country that is not their own, but being deported to some kind of a [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2510.72s)]
*  foreign prison for a sentence without end. They just skip right over that. Oh, look, [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2515.3599999999997s)]
*  all these right wingers, all these Trump goons, they're all like, oh, we can't have a country [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2522.3999999999996s)]
*  anymore because the court is stopping us from enforcing our immigration laws. Nobody's stopping [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2526.3199999999997s)]
*  them from enforcing our immigration laws. Nobody. They have created something so heinous [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2530.48s)]
*  that every court is forcing them to stop and then claiming that is preventing them from doing [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2535.4399999999996s)]
*  anything beneath that legally to address what they view as an undocumented immigration crisis. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2539.52s)]
*  These prisons, by the way, like the people are tortured, beaten, sexually assaulted. It's like, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2546.08s)]
*  it's horrific. Also remember that we're also apparently the Trump administration's plan is [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2552.0s)]
*  to send one million Palestinians in Gaza to Libya. Right. Oh, yeah. We locate like the entire Gaza [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2556.88s)]
*  strip. So someone I saw a report that that in terms of like population proportion, that would be like [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2562.8s)]
*  relocating 40 or 45 million people to the United States. Like it's completely [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2568.56s)]
*  unworkable. There's no infrastructure. There's no way to take care of that number of people, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2573.52s)]
*  but this is a serious plan that's being considered. Now it's been rejected by there's two, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2577.92s)]
*  there's like a Western government in Tripoli and then there's an Eastern government run by this [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2582.0s)]
*  warlord. They're both like, no, this is crazy. We're rejecting this idea, but the Israelis seem [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2585.44s)]
*  down to do it. And all the people that they're, they're sending to these prisons from here, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2589.28s)]
*  you know, they, the, the right wing is like, well, but they're all terrorists or gang members. It's [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2594.64s)]
*  like, it says you says the Trump administration without ever proving it in a court of law. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2598.88s)]
*  They do not offer any evidence. They do not go see a judge. They don't do any of these things. They [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2604.72s)]
*  just say, we say that they're terrorists. We say that they're gang members. And of course, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2609.92s)]
*  there are some gang members. There are some criminals. There are some violent people that [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2613.76s)]
*  they are deporting in this country. And they use those deportations and those stories to say like, [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2617.2s)]
*  well, that means it's everyone. And, and, and there was, and they've just been caught in so [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2623.2s)]
*  many fucking lies. Like the spokesperson for the department of Homeland security, a job that in [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2627.2s)]
*  many cases would be one where in a serious crisis would need to tell you information about what is [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2631.9199999999996s)]
*  happening is a fucking liar. She just lies all the time from that podium. She, we've been caught [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2638.0s)]
*  over and over again. They've lied about Andre Hernandez, Romero. They have lied about all these [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2642.48s)]
*  people. So you can't take them and forget, forget not proving it. They are lying about it. They [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2646.3999999999996s)]
*  don't care about the truth. Yeah. The Supreme Court did rule in Trump's favor on another [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2650.4s)]
*  immigration issue Monday. The administration can proceed for now with revoking temporary [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2654.88s)]
*  protected status TPS for Venezuelans here, legally putting nearly 350,000 more migrants [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2660.48s)]
*  at risk of deportation. Only Katanji Brown Jackson dissented on that one. But the [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2669.76s)]
*  administration's rationale for invoking the alien enemies act to quickly remove Venezuelans who [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2675.52s)]
*  the government says belong to the Trende Aragua gang is really falling apart. Last week, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2680.56s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard fired the two members of the national intelligence council who wrote a report that [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2686.1600000000003s)]
*  concluded the government of Venezuela is not directing the activities of Trende Aragua, [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2690.7200000000003s)]
*  meaning it's not an invasion, meaning Trump can't invoke the alien enemies act. The New York Times [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2695.52s)]
*  reported that after the report was leaked, one of Tulsi Gabbard's top aides asked the national [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2700.6400000000003s)]
*  intelligence council to quote, rethink its analysis and issue a new assessment. But their [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2705.52s)]
*  assessment didn't change. So Gabbard fired the two top members of the national intelligence council [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2710.56s)]
*  with the stated reason being that she's trying to end the quote weaponization and politicization [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2716.4s)]
*  of the intelligence community. I'm sure she nailed that one. That sounds that's an interesting way [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2721.6s)]
*  to stop weaponization. Yeah. And this is some of those brazen politicization interference in the [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2727.04s)]
*  intelligence community since the Iraq war. I mean, the rock was Dick Cheney and his goons, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2731.44s)]
*  cherry picking intelligence that fit the narrative they wanted to sell about Iraq having WMD or [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2735.76s)]
*  whatever. And that meant elevating intelligence that we believe with low confidence and presenting [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2741.04s)]
*  it as dispositive while downplaying dissenting opinions. This is her having a person be like, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2746.08s)]
*  Hey, I know you said you think this, but what if you thought that? And when they disagreed, [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2752.96s)]
*  they fired them like that is, I don't know that it's like a new level of shocking. And also [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2756.4s)]
*  Laura Loomer was behind this one. Laura Loomer tweeted on April 20th, the NIC senior officials [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2762.2400000000002s)]
*  should be fired. And then it happened. Remember Laura Loomer is this white right wing freak who [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2768.0s)]
*  chained herself to the Twitter offices in New York city. And, and I was wearing a star of David [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2772.8s)]
*  because she said she was being persecuted like the Jews during the Holocaust. I just, the United [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2777.04s)]
*  States is not currently under invasion by Venezuela. I just think that's a kind of the words have me [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2781.44s)]
*  meaning like the trend, their Agua, I don't think, I think any, if we have gang members that are [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2786.32s)]
*  committing violent and terrible crimes in our country and are here illegally, they should be [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2793.84s)]
*  arrested and deported, of course. But the word invasion has meaning. We're not being invaded. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2797.1200000000003s)]
*  America's we're not being invaded. Like dancing on the head of a pin here, like, well, technically, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2804.56s)]
*  if we can prove that someone in the Venezuelan government is in contact with someone from [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2809.36s)]
*  Trenderrego, then we can call it an invasion. It's ridiculous. The Supreme Court hasn't yet [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2812.56s)]
*  ruled on the, whether it's appropriate, whether it's lawful for Trump to invoke alien enemies. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2816.24s)]
*  They keep pushing that off. In the latest ruling, they basically kicked it back to the fifth circuit [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2821.92s)]
*  to tell them to roll and then it will, it will come back to the Supreme Court at some point. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2827.36s)]
*  This Tulsi stuff, the intelligence, this is, if their case wasn't, wasn't great before the [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2831.2s)]
*  administration's case on alien enemies act, but this is going to really fuck it. But also like in [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2837.2s)]
*  the near term, this means it justifies the deportations of these Venezuelan migrants. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2841.36s)]
*  What if Trump decides, you know what, we got to take the fight to Maduro, this invasion, we got [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2848.0s)]
*  to cut it off, you know, we're at the head and invade them, right? Because remember in the first [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2852.56s)]
*  Trump term, John Bolton famously went to the press briefing room with like a little note that was [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2856.8s)]
*  visible on his folder that said 5,000 US troops to Columbia, where he was trying to like beat the [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2862.4s)]
*  drum of war with the Venezuelans. Like Marco Rubio is very much on board with this sort of hardline [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2867.76s)]
*  anti-Maduro, anti-Venezuela worldview. I don't know, like it just, this is, it could get so much [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2874.5600000000004s)]
*  worse than this. And it's setting a precedent that no one in Congress seems to care about on [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2882.1600000000003s)]
*  the Republican side. Also, it may be lawful, at least that's what the Supreme Court rules, that [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2886.5600000000004s)]
*  Trump can revoke temporary protected status for 350,000 Venezuelans, but it is a horrific policy. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2892.56s)]
*  And imagine those, imagine if you're in this country legally and you've been settling here [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2900.96s)]
*  because you were granted protected status and you have legal status in your Venezuela and you wake [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2906.24s)]
*  up today and you realize like now I could be, and it's not just deported back to Venezuela, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2909.84s)]
*  which would be bad enough. Who knows what these people will do with you? Who knows if you get [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2915.2799999999997s)]
*  to sent to CICOT or you get sent to fucking Libya or wherever else. You had a DUI and suddenly you're [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2918.8s)]
*  in a detention facility without end. It is bad enough just from a human [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2924.8s)]
*  standpoint to revoke the status from people that are desperately fleeing political instability and [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2928.6400000000003s)]
*  violence. Revoking the status from Afghan refugees who were allies, who by many accounts would be [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2933.76s)]
*  basically facing death if they go back to Afghanistan. Revoking the status of those [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2944.48s)]
*  people who worked with special forces, who worked with American troops, who risked their lives [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2950.96s)]
*  and helped our military. You're going to send them back while bringing in a bunch of fucking [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2956.8799999999997s)]
*  white South African refugees to kind of stoke the erogenous zone of your right-wing racist base. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2962.7999999999997s)]
*  This is disgusting. And as with the US government policy in Venezuela is like just to [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2969.68s)]
*  destroy their economy with as many sanctions that we can possibly layer on. So we're sending people [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2973.68s)]
*  back. There's no life you can build from yourself in Venezuela if you're trying to get a job. If [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2978.24s)]
*  you're an asylum seeker, if you're seen as a political dissident, you will face persecution, [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2982.56s)]
*  violence or just economic destitution. Pod Save America is brought to you by Zbiotics pre-alcohol. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2987.68s)]
*  Let's face it, after a night with drinks, I don't bounce back the next day like I used to. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2993.6s)]
*  Gotta make a choice. Either have a great night or a great next day. That is until I found [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=2997.44s)]

*  FBI Director Cash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino, what a duo, sat down on Sunday for a Fox [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3163.44s)]
*  interview where they made clear that they've been compromised by the deep state. When asked about the [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3169.68s)]
*  truth behind the Trump assassination attempts and the death of Jeffrey Epstein, here's what they said. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3174.96s)]
*  In some of these cases, the there you're looking for is not there and I know people, I get it, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3179.76s)]
*  I understand. It's not there. If it was there, we would have told you. As someone who has worked [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3185.92s)]
*  as a public defender, as a prosecutor who's been in that prison system, who's been in the Metropolitan [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3193.84s)]
*  Detention Center, who's been in segregated housing, you know a suicide when you see one and that's what [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3197.92s)]
*  that was. They killed himself. Again, you want me to, I've seen the whole file. He killed himself. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3203.44s)]
*  Who got to them? Maybe they were already, look, who better to protect the deep state than two people [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3210.7200000000003s)]
*  that had claimed to be outsiders all along? Two people that these, that the conspiracy theorists [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3217.76s)]
*  they could trust, who now once finally in their position to do the ultimate cover up. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3222.8s)]
*  It's incredible work. It's incredible work by the Jews. I thought you were going to say Hillary [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3231.92s)]
*  Clinton. Yeah and Hillary Clinton. Yeah. Someone tweeted the other day, why does Cash Patel always [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3235.6800000000003s)]
*  look like he just shit his pants? It's really spot on. Isn't it a little bit strange? Like I was [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3240.0800000000004s)]
*  talking about this with Tim because we did a short YouTube thing about this but they seem to be, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3245.52s)]
*  acting almost responsible in this conversation. Like it's weird. Well they're getting attacked. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3252.72s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. The MAGA people are very upset with them but you know I've had this thought and in [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3258.24s)]
*  this interview really brought it back up for me which is there are a lot of just awful, awful [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3263.68s)]
*  people in the cabinet but I thought that Cash Patel and Dan Bongino would be at the very top [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3269.12s)]
*  of the list and there's still plenty of time. I don't want to count my chickens here but they are [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3275.12s)]
*  not, they're not the worst ones so far. It's so strange. We have no idea what they're pursuing. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3279.68s)]
*  We have no idea what kind of unholy investigations they're launching, planning to launch, what's [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3288.24s)]
*  going on behind the scenes but the fact that- Maybe they're like we got the last two years. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3292.24s)]
*  This is like- We're going to go nuts on the last two years. We're two hours into an eight hour [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3296.56s)]
*  drive and you're like I can't believe there's no traffic. This is going to end in disaster man. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3300.3199999999997s)]
*  I would just also point out these are clearly guys who went from being right wing podcasters who would [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3305.52s)]
*  just spew conspiracy theories in service of building an audience like January 6th was an inside job, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3310.96s)]
*  Cash Patel played footsie with QAnon. He was threatened to prosecute the media for reporting [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3316.48s)]
*  on January 6th. He talked about selling supplements that can detoxify you from the COVID vaccine. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3322.24s)]
*  Every conspiracy theory was just an opportunity to grift and build an audience. Now they have [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3327.3599999999997s)]
*  responsibility. They're getting attacked for not releasing the obscene files and I think clearly [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3332.96s)]
*  they're flailing a bit but what is remarkable from that interview is this is the shit they're [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3337.84s)]
*  spending most of their time on. You can just tell. They are managing right wing fever dreams [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3343.36s)]
*  and you have to wonder what does the opportunity cost here? What is the FBI not doing? What are we [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3349.2s)]
*  espionage case? Are the Chinese just fulfilling to their wildest dreams? [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3356.56s)]
*  Yeah they can't believe their luck. They cannot believe their luck. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3361.36s)]
*  Yeah I also like the like I had the other reaction to this which is what are they hearing? What are [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3364.2400000000002s)]
*  they seeing that makes them feel so chastened by this role? Like the seriousness of this role [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3371.1200000000003s)]
*  that they feel like they need to go out there and basically defend the bureau. Maybe they're just [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3375.84s)]
*  straight shooters you know like you. Calling them like they see it. They're awful. I would not have [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3381.1200000000003s)]
*  imagined that like if you had heard that that Pam Bondi and Kristi Noem would be making headlines [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3386.32s)]
*  for doing more evil shit so far in the Trump administration than Dan Bongino and Cash Patel. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3394.0s)]
*  Like I wouldn't have taken that bet. Yeah I just think the nature of the job. I mean like when do [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3398.8s)]
*  you hear from the deputy FBI director normally? Never. It's weird that they're doing these [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3402.2400000000002s)]
*  interviews in the first place and they're also kind of mopping up shit that Pam Bondi spilled [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3405.52s)]
*  on the ground because she went out there and gave all these right-wing influencers these [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3409.6000000000004s)]
*  phase one binders. That was supposed to be a surprise for everyone. It was a big surprise. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3412.88s)]
*  Like even Marco Rubio has done some horrible shit compared to these days. Yeah there's turtles all [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3418.48s)]
*  the way down with these people. So Trump over the weekend just reposted this conspiracy video from [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3425.04s)]
*  2016 of the Clinton body count of all the different. Hillary Clinton, I don't know if you're [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3432.32s)]
*  dear listeners as surprised to me as it might be to you, one of the most prolific serial killers [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3437.6800000000003s)]
*  basically. Just a spree for decades and I wonder if he posted that. It's like the conspiracy theory [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3442.08s)]
*  version of his Medicare EO where he's like he knows he's about to see. He knew that Dan Bongino [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3449.7599999999998s)]
*  and Cash Patel were about to say that Epstein killed himself so he needed to get out in front [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3456.4s)]
*  of it and put out some fucking fringe conspiracy content about Hillary Clinton because there's [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3460.08s)]
*  just no there there. He's doing interviews where he's talking about how I'm putting out the RFK [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3464.64s)]
*  file and putting up the JFK file and putting out the MLK file and putting out the alien file but [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3468.48s)]
*  there's no there there anywhere. None of this is leading to the kind of grand. They're not coming [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3472.4s)]
*  to completion. The right wing conspiracy theories are not finishing and Trump has just kind of been [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3477.44s)]
*  edging these people for fucking a decade and I think he genuinely doesn't know what to do. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3482.72s)]
*  Right? I couldn't have said it better myself. He also has siloed communication channels where he's [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3489.12s)]
*  allowed to just chum the water over on Tooth Social and then be like semi-normal and public. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3494.56s)]
*  Yeah. No, I think that's another point too. I mean, I think there's still hope for Cash Patel [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3499.7599999999998s)]
*  and Dan Bongino from some of the MAGA base if they're disappointed because they were also asked [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3505.7599999999998s)]
*  about January 6th and specifically whether there were undercover FBI agents in the crowd egging [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3510.08s)]
*  people on. Something that Cash Patel has mused about in the past. He seemed really excited to [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3515.12s)]
*  tell Maria Bartiromo that the bureau is sending documents to Congress right now full of new [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3521.44s)]
*  answers on this and then Bongino stepped in to kind of throw a little cold water on that saying [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3526.48s)]
*  that when we do get information everyone needs to remember the difference between an FBI agent [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3532.7200000000003s)]
*  and an FBI source. Just Dan Bongino, voice of reason again. Deputy Dan kind of bigfoot in his [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3537.2000000000003s)]
*  boss there. Well, it's funny because when Bongino was being, yeah, when Bongino was, I know it was [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3542.96s)]
*  during the hearing or when he was being interviewed about his different role, he talked [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3547.92s)]
*  about how when you're a podcaster it's one role and I've had serious roles in my, and it does [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3552.96s)]
*  genuinely seem like he views them as fundamentally distinct. What a world. Well, I mean, they do have [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3559.04s)]
*  a workforce, right? They have to go wake up the next day and work with a bunch of FBI officials [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3565.2000000000003s)]
*  and look them in the eye in meetings. And those are serious fucking guys that don't suffer fools, [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3570.0s)]
*  that are probably pretty intimidating. Yeah. And you know, I think everyone kind of gets captured [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3575.2s)]
*  by the building you work in to some extent. You go a little bit native in these jobs. And so [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3579.04s)]
*  what I think they're setting up is the fact that there were probably people in the crowd on January [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3583.4399999999996s)]
*  6th who had been FBI sources. Yeah. There were right wing conspiracy theories always been that [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3588.48s)]
*  the FBI sent those people out into the crowd and they told them like, let's go do it. Let's storm [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3593.04s)]
*  the Capitol. And they were kind of like fomenting the violent part of the day. And then the FBI is [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3597.6s)]
*  directly responsible for it in some way. And that's obviously not true. And it's never been the case, [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3603.52s)]
*  but they're kind of clearly alluding to that. And what they're trying to tell the audience is [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3608.32s)]
*  be satisfied when what we tell you is that there were FBI sources in the crowd that day and not [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3612.64s)]
*  necessarily undercover agents. Yeah. Well, there was a, I think there was an IG report, an inspector [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3618.96s)]
*  general's report in 2024 about this. And I think there were around like 20 sources, FBI sources who [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3623.68s)]
*  were in or in and around the Capitol that day, including like the Proud Boy leadership. Right. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3630.48s)]
*  But there was only, but they were, and they were like three or four that the FBI had asked to go [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3634.32s)]
*  there to monitor domestic terrorism. So I am sure that there are going to be things that had been in [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3640.0s)]
*  that report already that will be revealed as like, it's suddenly new information and all that kind [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3645.28s)]
*  of shit. It's also so stupid. It's like, it's not far from the trend, the Agua thing, like, oh, [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3650.48s)]
*  they're trying to find a connection to trend or Agua. We haven't been invented by Venezuela. No [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3656.48s)]
*  report can change that. Okay. Let's say there was, let's say there was an FBI informant somewhere [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3660.48s)]
*  there on January 6th. If an FBI informant is standing next to you and he's like, Hey, you want [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3665.68s)]
*  to go rob this fucking bank? You're not like, there's no, you're still robbing a bank. You still have [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3669.2s)]
*  to say no. If all your, if all your FBI enforcements were to jump off a bridge, would you do that too? [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3673.28s)]
*  Yes. It's not, it's not, it's not an absolution. I mean, we just, apparently today they decided [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3677.92s)]
*  the Trump administration is going to give Ashley Babbitt's family $5 billion. They're going to [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3681.92s)]
*  settle that. Taxpayer money. That's your money going to go into the family of someone who tried [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3685.28s)]
*  to break into the Capitol and injure police officers. Yeah. I suspect this will be similar [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3690.32s)]
*  to the Epstein case in that a lot of this information's in the public domain already [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3693.52s)]
*  and they're going to repackage it. Yeah. Like if you talk to really the smart journalists who have [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3696.96s)]
*  really covered Jeffrey Epstein and his various horrific crimes and prosecutions, et cetera, [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3700.48s)]
*  over the decades, they'll tell you like, there's not a little black book waiting to be released [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3706.8s)]
*  by the FBI. Like a lot of this information has been in the public domain. It's been in court [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3710.48s)]
*  filings. It's been reported out by journalists and people are waiting for a smoking gun that [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3714.32s)]
*  probably does not exist. Trump also spent a good chunk of his weekend posting time [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3718.48s)]
*  threatening a variety of public figures. He called Bob Iger and ABC news sleazebags and gave them a [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3722.88s)]
*  quote, fair warning that quote, they must not say that Qatar is giving me a free plane because [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3728.88s)]
*  it's actually a gift to the defense department that Trump is taking with him when he leaves office. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3736.2400000000002s)]
*  It's actually, it's a Frankenstein was the doctor. That's what we're talking about here. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3741.12s)]
*  Then on Monday, the president of CBS news, one of Trump's other targets became the latest to resign [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3746.4s)]
*  from the network as CBS's parent company Paramount is moving towards a settlement with Trump over 60 [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3751.2s)]
*  minutes editing an interview with Kamala Harris. Trump's also threatening to investigate Kamala's [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3756.4s)]
*  celebrity endorsements, believe it or not. His claim is that Harris paid millions of dollars to [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3761.92s)]
*  Springsteen, Beyonce, Oprah, Bono and others for their endorsements, which she did not. But Trump [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3768.4s)]
*  said he's calling for a quote, major investigation and that the endorsements represent quote, an [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3774.56s)]
*  illegal election scam at the highest level. This all started last week after Trump posted on the [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3780.4s)]
*  way home from the middle East quote, has anyone noticed that since I said, I hate Taylor Swift, [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3786.48s)]
*  she's no longer hot. Then, then after Bruce Springsteen criticized Trump from the stage [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3791.36s)]
*  during a concert in England, Trump called the boss a quote, dried out prune of a rocker. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3797.12s)]
*  Springsteen responded the next night with this. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3803.12s)]
*  My home, they're persecuting people for their right to free speech and voicing their dissent. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3808.3199999999997s)]
*  A majority of our elected representatives have utterly failed to protect the American people [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3815.2799999999997s)]
*  from the abuses of an unfit president and a rural government. The America I've sought to you [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3824.24s)]
*  about for 50 years is real and regardless of its many faults, it's a great country with a great [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3832.8799999999997s)]
*  people and we will survive this moment. Yeah, I'm already still out on that. Just checking guys, [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3841.2s)]
*  is it illegal to say that Trump got a free plane from Qatar or to run for office with celebrity [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3848.16s)]
*  endorsements? You think those are illegal? Good question. I wish I knew that before we did the [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3853.52s)]
*  Cash Patel segment. Trump is doing, he's trying to intimidate people because if ABC was willing [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3857.92s)]
*  to settle with Donald Trump over what George Stephanopoulos said, which was completely and [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3868.4s)]
*  eminently defensible, he thinks he can threaten people into not referring to this as a gift to [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3873.6s)]
*  Donald Trump because it's technically a gift to his library. A library at this point, which would [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3878.72s)]
*  I think would be a plane. I don't know what else exists. Not any books, are they going to put the [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3883.7599999999998s)]
*  books in the plane? It's a flying library. It's going to be all over the world. Document retention [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3887.9199999999996s)]
*  over there either. The location is going to be wherever Trump is. It's also interesting that [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3891.7599999999998s)]
*  he's back to threatening ABC because he does these deals with the law firms and then he starts [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3896.08s)]
*  demanding that the law firms represent his skeezy friends. He does this deal with Columbia. Then he [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3902.4s)]
*  tries to put Columbia under receivership. He's now back to threatening Disney even though he did this [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3909.52s)]
*  filthy deal with Disney. At the same time, when he was in Abu Dhabi, he was talking about a great [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3914.88s)]
*  meeting he had with Bob Iger where Bob Iger showed him the plans for Disney Emirates. I don't know [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3922.48s)]
*  what they're going to call it. It seems to be like a carrot and stick thing with Disney. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3928.64s)]
*  I like that he says Taylor Swift is no longer hot after she just wrapped up a $2 billion tour [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3933.7599999999998s)]
*  and had people turning into the Super Bowl to see her. That doesn't seem like it tracks. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3940.0s)]
*  He really is just the most casual news consumer. I haven't heard much about Taylor Swift lately. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3944.08s)]
*  Everyone must know that like her. It's like whatever pops into his mind. He wraps up this [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3949.8399999999997s)]
*  whole trip in the Middle East. He's on the plane home. This is what he's posting. Then he's like, [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3956.16s)]
*  I'm going to investigate. Who cares? Why is he investigating in Calhoun? You beat her. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3960.96s)]
*  You won. You beat her. What was Beyonce worth? Not enough. Not enough. He turns on the television [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3966.16s)]
*  in Palm Beach and he sees a clean Eastwood and an escape from Alcatraz. Next thing we know, [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3972.7999999999997s)]
*  we're sending federal officials back to Alcatraz to reopen that bad boy. He's just riffing. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3977.3599999999997s)]
*  He's just riffing. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3982.88s)]
*  Okay. Before we go, just a few quick things. Mark your calendars on June 6th. Love it. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3984.1600000000003s)]
*  In the Bulwark's, Tim Miller and Sarah Longwell are hosting a big gay live show and fundraiser [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3989.44s)]
*  at the Lincoln Theater in DC. Love it. You guys tell us a little bit about the fundraiser. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3994.32s)]
*  It's at World Pride. We'll be at the Lincoln Theater. We're raising money for the Immigrant [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=3998.96s)]
*  Defenders Law Center, which represents Andre Hernandez-Ramero, who we talked about and a [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=4003.6800000000003s)]
*  bunch of the other people being held in El Salvador. All the proceeds will go to that [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=4007.04s)]
*  organization. It's a serious cause. It's going to be a very fun show. It'll be me. It'll be Tim. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=4013.36s)]
*  It'll be Sarah. It'll be a real test for her to see how many words can a lesbian get in edgewise. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=4018.08s)]
*  That's sort of the theme of the show. Drink every time Sarah gets to finish a sentence. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=4023.84s)]
*  But it's going to be really fun. We're lining up some great guests. If Tim and I can share a stage [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=4028.32s)]
*  and if a lesbian can share a stage with us, what can't we do? What can't we do together? [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=4034.08s)]
*  That Tommy and Dan and I and JVL are going to do counter-programming. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=4040.96s)]
*  Oh really? You're going to do a straight Pride? That's great. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=4045.44s)]
*  Yeah. It's going to be us. We're going to have some of the Afrikaners on. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=4050.08s)]
*  Well, it sounds like a really fun event. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=4056.88s)]
*  We're doing an immigrant event too. Outside of a PGA event. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=4058.64s)]
*  That's going to be a really nice time. Anyway, crooked.com events. That's the tickets. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=4066.96s)]
*  Right. Everyone go get some tickets. I think I want to fly across the country just to go. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=4071.2s)]
*  All right. Also, the Crooked Store has a bunch of great new merch, including new designs for [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=4076.56s)]
*  our classic Friend of the Pod T. This is part of a big upgrade at the Crooked Store. All crooked [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=4080.72s)]
*  merch is now made from higher quality, more durable materials with updated fits and more [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=4086.24s)]
*  sustainable manufacturing practices. The site got an upgrade too. See the new site and grab [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=4090.64s)]
*  a new Friend of the Pod T at the same old URL, crooked.com slash store. That's our show for today. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=4095.52s)]
*  Dan and I will be back with a new show on Friday. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujK5KDQaat0&t=4100.32s)]
