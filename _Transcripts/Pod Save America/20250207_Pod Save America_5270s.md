Video Description: Donald Trump and Elon Musk continue their all-out assault on the federal government, shuttering USAID, rooting out and firing workers linked in any way to diversity initiatives, and breaking and ignoring laws as they go. Jon and Dan hash out all the latest, including Trump's plan to have the US "own" and redevelop Gaza, Democratic pushback, and whether federal judges will step in to stop—or at least slow—the madness. Then, Tommy talks with Sen. Brian Schatz about Democrats' all-night floor fight against Trump's OMB pick, what they think is working, and how they're gearing up for the big battles ahead.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Donald Trump and Elon Musk's Shocking New Attacks to Dismantle Government
**Pod Save America:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc)
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Jon Favreau. I'm Dan Pfeiffer. On today's show, we'll talk about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump's new proposal for the United States to quote own Gaza. His continued destruction of our [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4.72s)]
*  own government that's being led by Elon Musk. And he may finally be hitting some legal roadblocks, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  so we'll talk about that. The Democrats are also now using what little power they have to fight [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=16.48s)]
*  back. And later you'll hear Tommy's conversation with Senator Brian Schatz about why he and his [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=20.64s)]
*  colleagues gave speeches all night to oppose Trump's nominee for OMB director and what else [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=24.72s)]
*  they're planning. But first, Trump attended the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday in Washington, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=29.28s)]
*  which you don't want to miss when you've been chosen by God to save America, as Trump has. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  In the spirit of our Lord and Savior, he gave a speech filled with his trademark humility and [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  grace. Let's listen. And as the Bible says, blessed are the peacemakers. And in that end, I hope [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=45.6s)]
*  my greatest legacy when it's all finished will be known as a peacemaker and a unifier. I hope [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=52.08s)]
*  that's going to be true. The opposite side, the opposing side, and they oppose religion, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=57.84s)]
*  they oppose God. I don't know if you've been watching, but we got rid of woke over the last [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=62.88s)]
*  two weeks. Woke is gone, so I'm sure you've seen it. The water comes down from the Northwest, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=67.04s)]
*  parts of Canada, I guess. And but the Pacific Northwest, and it comes down by millions and [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=72.4s)]
*  millions of barrels a day. And I opened it up. It wasn't that easy to do. But I opened it up, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=79.68s)]
*  and it's pouring down. And it's a beautiful thing. You know, it is it is pouring in Los Angeles has [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  been the last couple of days, and I assumed it was rain. But apparently, it's water from our Lord [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  and Savior, Donald Trump. Barrels of water from Northwest Canada via Donald Trump. Yeah, he just [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=100.72s)]
*  opened up the spigots and it's just been flowing from the skies because that's how water travels [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=106.0s)]
*  from north to south on our heads. That's how gravity works. So much to unpack here. But let's [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=110.96s)]
*  start with Trump's aspiration to be known as a peacemaker. Since we haven't had the pleasure of [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=117.44s)]
*  discussing his plan to turn Gaza into what he calls the Riviera of the Middle East, a phrase he [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=123.92s)]
*  blurted out during a press conference with Bibi Netanyahu on Tuesday, Trump did not rule out sending [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=130.16s)]
*  American troops into Gaza, which he said the US should quote own, but not before the forced [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  relocation of two million Palestinians, the very definition of ethnic cleansing. Trump later walked [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=142.4s)]
*  back the part about sending US troops. But aside from Israeli politicians and Trump surrogates, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=148.16s)]
*  just about every other observer is a mix of very confused and very opposed. Does this fall into the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=154.48s)]
*  watch what he does, not what he says category? Or is this one to take seriously? What was your [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=163.12s)]
*  reaction to this? We've talked a lot since Trump has been sworn in about how to modulate our [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=167.92s)]
*  reaction to certain things. We don't want to be at an 11 all the time and you want to try to separate [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=175.6s)]
*  just him just having verbal diarrhea on the stage from the things he's actually doing hurt [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  people's lives, many of which we're going to talk about in this podcast. But I do think that's at [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  times a false dichotomy. What the president says matters. Especially in foreign affairs. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=190.96s)]
*  Especially in foreign affairs. And so do I think that Donald Trump is going to be able to put [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=196.56s)]
*  together a plan to forcibly relocate two million people who do not want to go to countries who do [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=201.84s)]
*  not want to have them against the wishes of everyone in the region and do so without the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=208.16s)]
*  US troops so we can build luxury condos in Gaza? No, I think that's unlikely to happen. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=211.92s)]
*  But the fact that he said it and Tommy pointed this out, matters because that is a massive [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=216.16s)]
*  recruitment tool for Hamas and groups like Hamas. This is exactly what they have talked about. The [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=224.0s)]
*  idea they're going to be moved from their home so the United States of America can own Gaza [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=228.88s)]
*  for a resort, right? For a series of Trump resorts on the waterfront. That's a damaging [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=233.67999999999998s)]
*  thing to say. Oh, is it? Yeah, well, we are like we have this like everyone is like we're having [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=239.76s)]
*  like concern policing. Like, oh, you can't be worried about this. You have to be worried [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  about this. You're not worried enough about this. And like one of the ways we concern police is [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=250.16s)]
*  there's things he says that he's never going to do. And there are things that he's doing that he [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=254.88s)]
*  never talks about. Sometimes the things he says he's never going to do matter. And as you point [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=258.72s)]
*  out, particularly in foreign policy. So all the reporting and it was confirmed by the White House [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=263.12s)]
*  is was that this wasn't just off the cuff. He had been thinking about this for a while. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=267.04s)]
*  He's had this plan for a while. And Axios had a story. I think the headline was like, what was [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  in Trump's mind and what Trump was thinking with this? And so I said, Oh, I'm interested to learn [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=278.96000000000004s)]
*  this. And there was a source close to Trump that told Axios he is a disruptor and he wanted to [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=283.52s)]
*  challenge the discourse. That story made me want to throw my phone against the wall. He's a [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=290.08s)]
*  disruptor. He's just, you know, it's a war torn country with starving people in a in the middle [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=298.64s)]
*  of a conflict that has just been going on for hundreds of years, if not more, that is sort of [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=306.8s)]
*  a solution has evaded presidents and leaders. But you know what? Donald Trump's a disruptor. He's [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=316.56s)]
*  just wanting to he wants to challenge the discourse by saying that we should own Gaza as a country. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  We got Greenland, Canada, the Panama Canal, Gaza, we're going to forcibly displace 2 million [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=328.72s)]
*  Palestinians. But then he said, Oh, well, then they're gonna have new homes, new homes and just [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=337.04s)]
*  a nice life. And then maybe modern new homes, modern new homes, modern new homes, they're [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=342.16s)]
*  gonna have. Yeah. So like, clearly, I think what happened here is, someone told him that a very [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=347.04s)]
*  real problem right now is how are the people of Gaza going to live in a country that because of [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=351.92s)]
*  Hamas and the Israeli government is just absolutely fucking destroyed. There's people starving. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=358.8s)]
*  There's like, it's just it's horrible. Hamas has still not been completely rooted out, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=364.8s)]
*  either. And what are you gonna like? How are you going to rebuild? What are people going to do [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=369.20000000000005s)]
*  while you rebuild? Like, these are real questions. And it's a real challenge. And I think he didn't [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=373.52000000000004s)]
*  want to know more than that. And all he wanted to think of is like, well, why don't we do it? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=378.8s)]
*  Why we're buying up everything else? We're getting Greenland getting the rest of it. We'll do it. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=383.20000000000005s)]
*  It'll be great. We'll send troops. It'll be fine. They'll be fine. And then he just said it. I think [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=387.2s)]
*  that's probably he wants to be the guy who is seen as fixing the hard problems. But he doesn't want [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=392.32s)]
*  to do any of the difficult or unpopular things required to solve the hard problems. Look, if [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=397.76s)]
*  there is one situation in a history of world where it makes sense to just start spitballing ideas, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=403.12s)]
*  it's Middle East peace. Yeah, that's where you do it. That's where you want to freelance. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=408.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's where you want to freelance. As you also heard in the clip of the prayer breakfast, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=413.04s)]
*  woke is gonzo. We've talked about Trump and Elon trying to root out and fire federal workers [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=417.76s)]
*  who've had anything to do with any diversity initiatives. They also are trying to cancel all [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=422.96s)]
*  diversity programs. I think we've said this before, but there was even a lunar new year event [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=427.84000000000003s)]
*  at a public university that was canceled. Pam Bondi, who is now our attorney general. So [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=433.36s)]
*  congratulations, Pam Bondi. She has already released a memo instructing the Civil Rights [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=439.12s)]
*  Division of the Justice Department to quote, investigate, eliminate and penalize illegal DEI [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=444.32s)]
*  and DEIA preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities in the private sector [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=450.71999999999997s)]
*  and in educational institutions that receive federal funds. In case you don't know, DEIA, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=456.24s)]
*  the A is for accessibility. So we are also making sure that people with disabilities [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=462.88s)]
*  cannot have any initiatives or help or anything like that. We don't want to do anything [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=468.56s)]
*  for folks with disabilities as well. They got added to the DEI for Trump. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=472.48s)]
*  Bondi is also heading up a new task force to quote, eradicate anti-Christian bias, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=478.08000000000004s)]
*  which Trump also announced at the breakfast. And on Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order to [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=483.28000000000003s)]
*  ban trans girls from participating in girls sports, which will almost surely be challenged [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=487.76s)]
*  in court, though apparently the NCAA has already moved on this and is abiding by the order. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=493.12s)]
*  So the 10 athletes that that applies to in the NCAA. So we got that problem covered. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=499.76s)]
*  Promise is kept, right? The reaction from MAGA fans on social media suggests that this is the [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=508.88s)]
*  stuff they're most excited about. They're all high five and they're celebrating these moves. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=515.04s)]
*  Question is, are these performative? Are they real? And are some of them seemingly just too [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=519.84s)]
*  an excuse to fire and harass people who aren't Trump loyalists? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=527.6800000000001s)]
*  In everything Trump and his minions do, harassing people who are different than them is always, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=532.4s)]
*  that's the benefit of all of it, right? That is what that is. That is to them what cutting Medicare [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=541.0400000000001s)]
*  was to Paul Ryan, right? It's the thing they talked about when they were sitting by the keg in college. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=546.88s)]
*  Like that is the truth. These things are somewhat performative in the sense that there are always [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=551.04s)]
*  questions about the legal authority they are using here. Does it exist? Will a court uphold it? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=557.8399999999999s)]
*  Is the bizarre interpretation of various regulations they're using for these sorts [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=564.3199999999999s)]
*  of things truly give them the authority to do stuff? But they have real world effect, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=569.04s)]
*  right? Even like there's a very real chance you point out that the executive order on banning [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=573.28s)]
*  trans participation in sports is going to be held up by a court. That didn't stop the NCAA, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=578.24s)]
*  they did it. Half the country has laws in the books that ban trans participation in sports. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=583.6s)]
*  That does not, what's going to happen to half the country does not have those laws, right? Do you [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=588.16s)]
*  think our high school and rec leagues going to really take that, take a fight on, we want to take [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=592.48s)]

*  to unilaterally just get rid of the power of the purse to not spend money, Congress appropriates, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1258.1599999999999s)]
*  that would be a massive change in the balance of power in this country that is extended for centuries. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1262.6399999999999s)]
*  You could see them ruling, and they've been hinting at this for a while, and there have been some [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1269.4399999999998s)]
*  other rulings that pointed this direction, that the president does have more power than [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1272.8s)]
*  the president suggests in terms of firing civil servants or all that kind of stuff. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1279.6000000000001s)]
*  The Schedule F stuff, again, though, the way that Elon has gone about it, the whole thing about the [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1287.8400000000001s)]
*  payment systems and having random doge bags access the payment systems, I don't think they're [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1293.76s)]
*  going to get away with that one, but on some of the federal workers, I do wonder about the USAID [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1301.28s)]
*  stuff because I don't imagine that you can just eliminate an independent agency that was [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1305.68s)]
*  created due to a law that passed Congress. They're, of course, trying to get away with [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1312.48s)]
*  saying that they are reorganizing it, but just before we recorded the news is that only 290 of [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1317.8400000000001s)]
*  the 10,000 USAID employees worldwide will keep their jobs. That has to be illegal. Obviously, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1325.8400000000001s)]
*  the courts can decide what is truly legal or not, but as you pointed out, an agency created by [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1333.52s)]
*  Congress, funded by Congress, you do these things, and you can't just unilaterally fire all the [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1337.36s)]
*  people and make it go away and not spend the money. That clearly is a violation of something. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1341.68s)]
*  Yeah, it is. The USAID thing, and again, we all know that foreign aid doesn't pull well, get it, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1348.32s)]
*  but what is happening to USAID? Some of the employees at USAID have been serving their [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1357.76s)]
*  country for decades. They are some of the most apolitical, nonpartisan people you'll ever meet. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1364.96s)]
*  They're in dangerous areas all over the world trying to keep people alive with food and with [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1371.44s)]
*  medicine, and since this freeze, and Rubio's out there bullshitting that like, oh, the freeze is [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1377.68s)]
*  over and we've made exceptions and now everything should be fine, and if you can't get your grant [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1384.48s)]
*  back, then that's your problem, and maybe you're doing it on purpose to make us look bad, which is [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1388.8s)]
*  all bullshit, but since the freeze, and since the freeze has been ended, or at least there's been a [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1393.04s)]
*  carve out for life-saving assistance, it hasn't really worked. HIV patients still aren't getting [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1398.64s)]
*  their medicine in Sudan, where there is a genocide according to the United States government. Half the [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1404.96s)]
*  population of 50 million is starving, needs food, famine is spreading, and two-thirds of the soup [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1411.28s)]
*  kitchens in Khartoum, the biggest city, are closed because of this. I saw Samantha Power, the former [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1418.0s)]
*  USAID director, our friend, on Colbert the other night saying that this is how bad it was. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1424.0800000000002s)]
*  In some places in Africa, kids were in line for their TB medication, their tuberculosis, and three [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1431.2s)]
*  kids got theirs, and then the rest of the line had to go home because the freeze happened and [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1437.28s)]
*  they couldn't legally provide anymore. In Zambia, there's medical supplies to stop [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1441.92s)]
*  hemorrhaging pregnant women and life-threatening diarrhea in toddlers, and those are all gone now. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1448.16s)]
*  So it's just going to be like people around the world are going to die, and by the way, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1453.36s)]
*  the money that it costs for malaria nets or some of these life-saving HIV drugs is like [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1459.52s)]
*  a small, small amount of money. We're not saving as money. Money that's already been appropriated. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1466.48s)]
*  So don't fucking tell me that we're going to take this money and now give people tax cuts [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1471.52s)]
*  in America, which most people still probably wouldn't prefer, but this is just a waste now. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1476.16s)]
*  These USAID employees, they have families in foreign countries. Suddenly they've been told, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1483.1200000000001s)]
*  you've got to go home. They don't know how to go home. They don't know who to contact. They're [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1488.96s)]
*  taking their kids out of school. They've given their life for this. They are also, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1491.84s)]
*  I've talked to some people at USAID, they are threatening to investigate the senior officials [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1495.84s)]
*  at USAID for some of this DEI stuff or whatever, and the reason they want to do this is to try to [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1502.24s)]
*  fire them for a cause so they can make sure that none of these people have a severance, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1509.6s)]
*  none of these people have healthcare after they leave. So just like cut them off immediately and [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1514.08s)]
*  send them out the door. This is truly insane. It is a fraction of the government's budget, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1517.12s)]
*  and you can argue about individual programs or whatever else. It is a fraction of the [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1523.52s)]
*  government's budget. Maybe the reason they're going after this is because Elon Musk is mad [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1527.76s)]
*  at the USAID inspector general for investigating Starlink, or maybe because they recognize [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1532.32s)]
*  politically that foreign aid is the weakest of the herd. It's the easiest to go after, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1537.36s)]
*  the hardest to defend. You get Democrats in position where they're defending foreign aid. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1541.92s)]
*  I think Democrats should defend foreign aid in this case. We should defend the point of it. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1545.2s)]
*  We should defend the fact that we view it as our responsibility in the world to do good things. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1548.56s)]
*  It's just the way that it is ruthless, it is cruel. It's truly sociopathic the way they are [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1554.48s)]
*  doing this, just like targeting these people who did nothing. USAID isn't even really part of some [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1561.84s)]
*  crazy mega conspiracy like the FBI or the DOJ. It's a new one. They just discovered. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1570.16s)]
*  They just... As a scholar of Trump insanity or [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1576.8s)]
*  MAG insanity, you can understand we're going after Jack Smith people or the FBI agents who've [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1584.0s)]
*  investigated January 6th, even if they were just asked to do so by the superiors. That is also [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1588.0s)]
*  wrong and terrible. But this one just seems so random and the ruthlessness of it is... [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1591.52s)]
*  It's truly crazy. It's hard to fathom how insane this is. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1600.96s)]
*  Another possibility is that Elon and the DOJ bags are just... They're looking at programs that [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1604.24s)]
*  they're finding online and they are in some cases outright lying about them or taking it out of [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1610.8s)]
*  context or they don't know what the fuck they're talking about so it seems nefarious. They could [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1616.64s)]
*  have just seen a couple of those programs at USAID and decided, oh, that's where we're going to start. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1620.64s)]
*  Again, these people, because they have no experience in government, because they don't [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1625.1200000000001s)]
*  bother to learn anything, because they think they're the smartest fucking people in the world, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1628.24s)]
*  because everyone in government's bad and everyone's a tech is a fucking genius who's [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1632.0s)]
*  going to save the world. That's how they think out there, a lot of them, unfortunately. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1635.28s)]
*  They are now just... They're going on a website, USAspending.gov, and all the [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1639.4399999999998s)]
*  Elon fanboy accounts on Twitter are doing this too, and they're looking at publicly available [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1646.3999999999999s)]
*  information about government spending and acting like they are making some incredible discovery [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1652.8s)]
*  about corruption that has been hidden. The website is there because George W. Bush [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1661.6s)]
*  signed it into law thanks to a law that was sponsored by Senator Barack Obama and Republican, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1668.4799999999998s)]
*  extremely conservative Republican, Tom Coburn, to make sure that all the government spending [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1674.0s)]
*  and the entire budget is online for everyone to see. That's the only reason that they're all [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1677.9199999999998s)]
*  finding all this fucking spending, that they're like, oh, this is the greatest scandal in history, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1682.4799999999998s)]
*  and they just stumbled over it because they weren't fucking paying attention to anything [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1687.36s)]
*  the government did up until now, unless it had something to do with their companies and making [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1690.64s)]
*  sure they couldn't make more billions of dollars. I can't stand these... [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1695.2s)]
*  It does make me wonder if transparency is a mistake. It's just, you have people with massive [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1699.8400000000001s)]
*  megaphones just pushing out out of contact misinformation to large-scale people at a time [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1707.6000000000001s)]
*  which the media does not have the capability or the reach to push back. It's not particularly great. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1712.48s)]
*  There's so many examples of this, but the one that really took off this week is a real, a huge [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1718.32s)]
*  scandal, huge scandal. Here's Donald Trump describing it at the prayer breakfast this morning. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1725.12s)]
*  Did you see what happened yesterday where they found hundreds of millions of dollars of money [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1729.2s)]
*  was fraudulently given to newspapers and I guess Politico? I don't know. I hope you're [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1734.96s)]
*  enjoying your breakfast. No, they gave money to all this out of out of U.S. aid. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1744.48s)]
*  So, again, huge scandal. Trump also truth about it early on Thursday morning saying that billions [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1757.68s)]
*  of dollars had been stolen, quote, much of it going to the fake news media as a payoff for [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1762.4s)]
*  creating good stories about the Democrats. What a scandal. What a scandal. I mean, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1767.6s)]
*  well, think of all the good stories they've read about Joe Biden. Money well spent. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1772.24s)]
*  Just in case you think this is Donald Trump, no, the brain rot is now Trump, Elon Musk, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1776.24s)]
*  just dozens of fucking MAGA Doge accounts online, Musk fanboys, Trump fanboys, everywhere. They all [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1781.36s)]
*  think the right-wing media, they vote Fox, it's everywhere. The federal government purchased [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1789.36s)]
*  eight million dollars worth of Politico Pro subscriptions. Politico Pro is separate from [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1796.64s)]
*  regular Politico and it's for CEOs and companies and governments. And it's basically, I don't know, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1803.12s)]
*  you learn information about legislation and analysis and very complicated. It's like a [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1810.24s)]
*  Bloomberg terminal. It's like a Bloomberg terminal. And it's like $7,000 a year for a subscription to [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1815.28s)]
*  it. Pretty expensive. Look, if I saw a bunch of Politico Pro subscriptions in our budget, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1821.12s)]
*  I'd be like, Hey, do we really need that? Maybe we should cut those down. But like the idea that [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1827.4399999999998s)]
*  that was turned into the government, USAID is secretly funneling money to Politico to get good [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1832.56s)]
*  stories for Democrats. First of all, not getting their money's worth. I don't know if you've read [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1840.4799999999998s)]
*  Politico last couple of years, not getting their money's worth on that one. And there's also, then [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1847.28s)]
*  they go through and all of these Republican Senate offices, house offices also spending [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1852.56s)]
*  government money on a subscription to Politico Pro. In fact, in 2017, the executive office of [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1859.44s)]
*  the president under Donald Trump paid $97,000 to Politico Pro. You're, you are missing one key part [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1866.0s)]
*  of this conspiracy theory that is very important, which is on the day this sort of came up, it was [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1877.04s)]
*  reported by Semaphore that because of a glitch, Politico failed to pay their employees. So the [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1883.84s)]
*  theory is not just that the government was giving all this money to Politico. It's that once Elon [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1890.1599999999999s)]
*  Musk in the doge bags, which I assume he made up and it's quite impressive. Very good. That's [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1898.56s)]
*  just genius at work. You know what guys, I'm just a little behind the scenes. Reed didn't want me to [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1904.24s)]
*  call them nerds because he thought that was, you know, he said, and I quote in his, where he comes [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1908.3200000000002s)]
*  from in his social circle, nerds are cool. That's what he said. You know what nerds, I was a nerd, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1914.0s)]
*  nerds are cool. I'm not making fun of nerds. I get it. But fuck these people. Yeah. Yeah. The [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1918.48s)]
*  problem is not that they're nerdy. That is not, or that they're young or that they're smart or that [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1924.0s)]
*  they're like, great. I want young, smart people in government. And that's amazing. Want that. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1927.76s)]
*  To go back to this, the point here is, is people believe that Politico was unable to make payroll [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1934.8799999999999s)]
*  because Elon Musk in the doge bags shut off the fountain of money. And this one really is, this is [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1938.96s)]
*  like the chef's kiss apotheosis of perfect right-wing conspiracy theories. You have a [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1946.32s)]
*  shadowy government agency that helps foreign countries and foreign people funneling money [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1954.48s)]
*  to a Washington DC based outlet. That's owned by a German billionaire to write, to write good [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1962.32s)]
*  stories about Joe Biden and Democrats and bachelors with Donald Trump. That is like, that is everything. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1970.6399999999999s)]
*  It just, if you could just get Anthony Fauci's name in there, it would be just perfect. Like you would [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1974.8799999999999s)]
*  It's also perfect for like the anti-Anti-Trump sort of the former anti-Anti-Trump since they're [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1979.36s)]
*  all on board now, because they're all out there like, look, obviously the craziest conspiracy is [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1984.32s)]
*  wrong, but that is so much money. And the fact that everyone's defending this much money. It's like, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1988.48s)]
*  no, if you don't like the government spending this much on Politico pro subscriptions, go talk to [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1993.12s)]
*  your fucking Republican senators and congressmen, go through the normal process. So talk to your, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=1998.24s)]
*  talk to the fucking like, fine, cut it. I don't give a shit if anyone. Yeah. If Donald Trump wants [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2003.28s)]
*  to cancel all the Politico pro, that's his. Do it. Yeah. Do not cut those message box ones though. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2007.2s)]
*  I'd be very clear. Do not. I'm sure there's a lot of those in the federal government right now. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2014.4s)]
*  One more thing about the doge bags before we moved on. So of course everyone is like, what are these, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2018.48s)]
*  what are these kids helping Elon who haven't been vetted, don't have security clearances. They're [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2024.72s)]
*  trying to, I don't know, shut off millions of dollars of payments that have been appropriated by [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2030.56s)]
*  law. This is concerning. And then you get this from the Silicon Valley assholes who are on [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2035.12s)]
*  Twitter now, the Musk fans. And they're like, we should want, this is ridiculous. These are young, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2041.9199999999998s)]
*  smart, brilliant people. I know this one and he's brilliant. He's a coder, but it's like, great, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2047.6799999999998s)]
*  fine, whatever. That's not our issue. Well, wall street journal right before we recorded, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2052.24s)]
*  here's the lead, a key doge staff member who gained access to the treasury department's [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2058.0s)]
*  central payment system resigned Thursday after he was linked to a deleted social media account [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2061.92s)]
*  that advocated racism and eugenics. And you're thinking to yourself, well, what were the tweets? [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2067.28s)]
*  What do you mean by racism and eugenics? How bad could it really have been? Well, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2073.36s)]
*  here's a quote, just for the record, I was racist before it was cool. The account posted in July, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2077.12s)]
*  according to the journals review of archive posts, another one, you could not pay me to marry outside [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2082.48s)]
*  of my ethnicity. The account wrote on X in September, another one, normalize Indian hate. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2088.56s)]
*  And then this was in December, it was just a couple months ago, 99% of Indian H1Bs will be [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2095.36s)]
*  replaced by slightly smarter LLMs, AI. They're going back. Don't worry guys. To me, that's just [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2101.52s)]
*  that. That is the right. We're going to replace immigrants, people of color, ethnicities we don't [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2109.04s)]
*  like with the machines, with the robots. That's the vibe. That's the vibe there. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2114.88s)]
*  I hate to tell this to this Doge guy, but who do you think the LLMs are coming for next? [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2119.92s)]
*  I thought, look, there was another one. There's another one whose name had been out there. And I [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2126.48s)]
*  went to his Twitter account. He's retweeting fucking Nick Fuentes. I know he had dinner with [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2130.0s)]
*  Donald Trump, so I guess that's fine now. But like what? It's unfucking believable. Anyway. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2136.08s)]
*  Anyway. All right. Now it's time to talk about the Democrats again. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2142.48s)]
*  You know what? It's getting better every time we do this section. Lawmakers have been more vocal, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2146.88s)]
*  trying new legislative tactics, as we'll discuss in a minute. There's also been protests, rallies, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2152.16s)]
*  went to treasury, went to USAID. They are still working on landing the perfect sound bite. Let's [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2158.8s)]
*  listen. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2164.72s)]
*  We won't rest. Thank you, everybody. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2194.72s)]
*  Okay. Okay. So I just want to say, poor Chuck Schumer. He's gotten a lot of shit online for that. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2198.48s)]
*  And yeah, do you cringe listening to it? Sure. Is Chuck Schumer the most eloquent speaker? Is [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2206.16s)]
*  he going to rile up a crowd? Probably not. Could you not understand what the crowd said when they [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2213.52s)]
*  said, what do we want? Me neither. Me neither. But you know what? They're trying. They are out [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2221.28s)]
*  there trying and they are doing their best with what they got. And I am going to give them credit [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2226.2400000000002s)]
*  for that. And I realize it's cringe and I realize it's not great. But you know what? It's all hands [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2232.32s)]
*  on deck right now and everyone's just throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks and we're [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2238.0s)]
*  trying. And I encourage that. Well, we were on this podcast last week or the week before [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2241.52s)]
*  some other time in the 12 years when Donald Trump has been president. We talked about how [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2246.0s)]
*  Democrats have to get out there and make noise, just start talking, stop worrying about what [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2250.8s)]
*  exactly it is you're going to say and just be out there. That clip makes me question that advice, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2254.96s)]
*  I would say. No, in all seriousness, look, is it perfect? Don't worry about everything you're [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2259.44s)]
*  going to say, but do say something. That's right. I mean, the clip of [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2264.88s)]
*  Maxwell Frost asking what do we want and then they probably be unable to answer is kind of [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2269.44s)]
*  like the moment that we'll... It's on the nose. How we lost this election to Timecast, so that'll be it. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2273.84s)]
*  Look, let's give credit where credit is due is they are out there. They are making noise. They are [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2278.56s)]
*  raising hell. We'll talk about it in a minute. They are doing... They're fighting back now in ways [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2286.0s)]
*  they were not in the first couple of weeks and we should give them credit for that. And just the [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2290.24s)]
*  mere fact that there is an opposition presence raising hell about the bad things that are [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2294.8s)]
*  happening is a huge change from where we were two weeks ago and it's a net positive for sure. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2300.08s)]
*  And again, let's talk about Chuck Schumer. He's got this Democratic caucus. He's got [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2305.28s)]
*  John Fetterman in the caucus. He's got some other people who are probably telling him, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2309.6800000000003s)]
*  we want to vote for some of the nominees because that's good politics in my state and he has to [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2313.52s)]
*  balance all the needs of the caucus. And to Schumer's credit, they came up with a strategy [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2317.0400000000004s)]
*  this week. They said, can we stop any of these nominees? No, we don't have the votes because we [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2321.6800000000003s)]
*  don't have enough senators. And so what can we do? Well, we can slow them down. We can hold the floor [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2326.32s)]
*  and give a bunch of speeches so that we delay these nominations already. I think Cash Patel now [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2334.08s)]
*  is not going to be voted on for another week because of Democrats delay tactics. So they're [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2338.56s)]
*  gumming up the works. They're doing what they can and they decided to hold the floor Wednesday night [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2343.8399999999997s)]
*  into Thursday for the nomination of Russ Vogt for Office of Management and Budget, the budget [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2348.7999999999997s)]
*  director. And Brian Schatz, who you're going to hear in a bit, talked to Tommy and Schumer's [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2355.6s)]
*  office and everyone, you know, they reached out to us and said, look, we're going to hold the floor. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2362.4s)]
*  We want to make some noise. You guys were talking about making noise. Well, how about you guys do a [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2365.6800000000003s)]
*  live stream and, you know, we'll have all the senators who are on the floor or a bunch of [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2369.6s)]
*  senators on the floor, Democratic senators come talk to you guys. And, you know, we did it. It [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2373.76s)]
*  was great. And, you know, they sat down, they were there all night. They popped into the live stream. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2376.96s)]
*  And again, it's like we're people are trying here. People are trying and we have limited power. And [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2382.48s)]
*  that doesn't mean that people who aren't good or bad messaging, whatever, gets a pass. Like we can [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2388.48s)]
*  all improve. But they're trying. They're trying. And so now Schumer has also got the whole caucus [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2392.96s)]
*  to oppose or he's asking the whole caucus to oppose all of the remaining Trump nominees [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2400.0s)]
*  as a protest. Again, probably not going to do anything because unless we get Susan Collins [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2406.32s)]
*  and Murkowski and McConnell and someone else to vote against them. So it's probably not going to [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2411.04s)]
*  happen. But good for him. And then Hakeem Jeffries, a Democratic Minority Leader in the House, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2414.56s)]
*  he had a letter earlier this week that made clear that House Democrats won't be helping [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2421.12s)]
*  Republicans deal with government funding or the debt limit unless they undo Trump's federal [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2425.2799999999997s)]
*  spending freeze and potentially other concessions. What do you think about that? That strikes me as [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2430.32s)]
*  the most the most effective move because it's probably the one piece of leverage the Democrats [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2436.0s)]
*  have. Yeah, I this is Rod's very counter to everything I've ever said before in my career, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2441.2s)]
*  but Democrats should absolutely, in my view, hold the debt ceiling hostage. Me too. Me too. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2446.72s)]
*  We're in a new we're in a new time. But it's also it is different to be fair before all the people [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2453.4399999999996s)]
*  who yelling hypocrite at us come at us is Democrats are not in the same position that McCarthy was [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2458.56s)]
*  with Biden or Boehner was with Obama. Democrats don't control the floor. And there are enough [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2462.96s)]
*  Republican votes to extend the debt ceiling. Yep. They do not need a single Democratic vote. If Mike [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2468.4s)]
*  Johnson and Donald Trump are unable to get the votes they need and they want a Democratic vote, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2473.28s)]
*  they're going to have to give us something very significant for this is on them. It's not by the [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2477.6800000000003s)]
*  way, we're not saying give us something like give us universal health care and we'll raise that. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2482.4s)]
*  Right. Like stop fucking shutting down payments. Yes. That Congress lawfully appropriated. Yes. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2486.32s)]
*  This is a very important point. Stop letting 25 year old racists access to the fucking treasury [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2493.7599999999998s)]
*  payment system. You assholes. Yeah, there's some. This is not Ted Cruz demanding the defunding of [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2499.7599999999998s)]
*  the Affordable Care Act. This is asking for the government to spend the money appropriated by [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2506.24s)]
*  Congress the way Congress wanted it to be appropriate in mind you bipartisan budget deals. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2512.16s)]
*  Right. This is not we are not even asking, although we could to to for Donald Trump to [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2516.72s)]
*  spend all the money that Hakeem Jeffries, Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden sent his way. That's not [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2522.56s)]
*  even it. These are all deals signed off on by Mitch McConnell, Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2526.56s)]
*  Mike Johnson. Like that's all we're asking. But no Democrat should vote for the debt ceiling absent [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2532.72s)]
*  a significant set of concessions from the Republicans. Yeah. You want the debt ceiling [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2539.2799999999997s)]
*  votes? Go talk to Chip Roy, who's probably not going to give you a yes vote on that because it [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2543.84s)]
*  doesn't cut enough and which is for him most of government like go yell at him. Go talk to the [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2548.48s)]
*  Freedom Caucus. They're going to be they're the ones who are going to vote no on this. Don't [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2553.36s)]
*  fucking talk to Democrats when you are like violating the law and refuse to be held accountable by [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2556.48s)]
*  anyone. I think Democrats should adopt as a general approach, essentially a no layups rule. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2562.16s)]
*  Everything you want to do, we're going to make harder. Yes. Right. Even if like it may it may [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2569.36s)]
*  see like you guys did this live stream, the senators were out there, they're they're eating [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2573.76s)]
*  up clock and say, well, what did that actually get? He is going to get confirmed. You know what [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2577.52s)]
*  it gets us is every single minute. Sorry, every single minute that we that we're Donald Trump and [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2581.52s)]
*  and the Republicans unable to do what they want to do. So a minute they're never going to get back. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2587.84s)]
*  Yeah. Right. We are burning clock here. And we should do on everything you delay it, we use every [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2591.28s)]
*  tactic we have. And it's frustrating to people there are we don't have a lot of leverage, you [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2597.28s)]
*  don't have a lot of power. But everything we do have you do to delay to obstruct to make it because [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2601.04s)]
*  there are no other checks. Yeah. Right. There's there is no one in the public. There are not a [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2606.48s)]
*  people in the Republican Party here going to stand up to him. The media cannot do it. The Supreme [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2610.48s)]
*  Court is on his side. He is they are trying to run roughshod over how our government works. And [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2614.64s)]
*  we have to use every tool we have to fight back in every way possible. And it may it's not always [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2619.76s)]
*  gonna be satisfying. But every single little bit helps that delay that is one week that cash Patel [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2623.92s)]
*  is not going to be able to prosecute Donald Trump's investigate Donald Trump's political enemies. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2629.84s)]
*  Right? Yeah, that seemed like a lot. It's going to seem like a lot to the people in that who were [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2635.52s)]
*  going to prosecute that one week. Like that's it's not the end. It's not going to solve all of our [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2638.88s)]
*  problems. But it's the right approach. No lamps. And again, the rest of us don't have to be [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2642.88s)]
*  spectators here. In fact, we shouldn't be spectators. Like the other the other tool we have is to make a [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2647.7599999999998s)]
*  lot of noise about this. And we don't have the megaphone that Donald Trump and Elon have. But [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2653.44s)]
*  we you know, we have some numbers. And everyone has you always say this, everyone has the potential [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2659.68s)]
*  in their own life to talk to friends and colleagues and post and we all have platforms. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2664.88s)]
*  And doesn't matter how big your following is, like we got to get up off the mat here and actually [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2669.6s)]
*  start fighting. And I know that like, you know, there was an Axios story that Democrats were [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2674.56s)]
*  getting like deluged with calls and to like ask them to fight. And I think that some of the [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2680.6400000000003s)]
*  Democratic politicians like, okay, we are what else do you want us to do? Like, call some of the [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2686.1600000000003s)]
*  Republicans, the House Republicans in vulnerable districts, so we can take the House back, call [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2690.96s)]
*  their offices, go go protest outside their offices. Because like, you know, we got to the Democrats, [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2695.7599999999998s)]
*  they get it now, they don't have much power because they didn't win. And you know, if they're [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2702.48s)]
*  backing off and not even putting up a fight, then yeah, we should yell at them. But right now they're [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2706.72s)]

*  of the podcast, Hawaii Senator Brian Schatz. How are you, Senator? [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2966.24s)]
*  I'm doing fine. We're mobilized. We're motivated. We're a little tired from the overnight, [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2969.6s)]
*  but we're doing fine. I was going to say, you're fresh off a democracy bender. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2975.3599999999997s)]
*  Senate Democrats held the floor for about 30 hours, I believe. First question is just how [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2980.64s)]
*  you're feeling, but also can you explain to listeners who didn't catch our live stream [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2985.3599999999997s)]
*  yesterday what you and other Senate Democrats have been up to? Well, we're maximally delaying [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2988.7999999999997s)]
*  the vote on Russ Vote to run the Office of Management and Budget. In order to do that, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=2994.24s)]
*  we took to the floor and basically haven't relinquished it. It will be done in a couple [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3000.8799999999997s)]
*  of hours. All Democrats are united against Russ Vote. I don't think anybody in the public has [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3004.8799999999997s)]
*  ever really paid attention to OMB, but the reason that this guy is so important is he's one of the [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3011.52s)]
*  authors of Project 2025. Part of Project 2025 specifically talks about how they think the job [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3016.64s)]
*  of OMB should be especially powerful, that it should be representing, quote, the president's [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3024.8799999999997s)]
*  mind in all things, like just weird stuff. The person who wrote that is Russ Vote. Now, the [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3030.64s)]
*  person who is going to assume that position is Russ Vote. This guy is the architect of the federal [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3036.96s)]
*  funding freeze. He's the architect of illegally dismantling agencies. He's quite a dangerous [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3041.28s)]
*  character. For those people who thought they were going to get like, we're going to shake up [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3047.52s)]
*  Washington and maybe we'll get some mean tweets, they are setting about to dismantle the American [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3051.6800000000003s)]
*  government's capacity to solve basic problems, not like new programs, but Medicaid, Medicare, [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3059.28s)]
*  Head Start, federal firefighters, VA home loans, the Small Business Administration. So this is [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3065.76s)]
*  deadly serious. We are fighting back. And even today, I think there were at least two positive [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3072.32s)]
*  results in the federal courts. So part of what we're trying to say to everybody is we will fight [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3078.08s)]
*  where we can. We are in the minority, which means that we're going to, frankly, lose some of these [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3083.76s)]
*  battles because it's going to be 5347 a lot. But we're starting to see a mass movement out there [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3089.84s)]
*  in the world that is standing up for democracy. And by the way, we are starting to see that, [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3095.84s)]
*  yes, the things that he is doing are illegal, and they are being found to be illegal, and they are [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3102.0s)]
*  being stopped by the courts. So one of Trump's magical sort of political powers is to get people [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3108.48s)]
*  to believe things that are flatly not true about him. And he's trying to EO his way around the [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3115.28s)]
*  fact that the stuff that he's doing or the stuff that he wants to do is so unpopular, there's no [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3121.92s)]
*  way it would get through any legislative body. They can't pass a bill. So they just like write [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3126.96s)]
*  it down as if that makes it law. That's not actually how it works. That's not in the [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3131.52s)]
*  Constitution, just jot it down. Will it to be? Yeah. Well, you were telling me yesterday [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3136.1600000000003s)]
*  that Russ Vogt kind of thinks of himself as the hand of the king. Is that in the Constitution [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3142.48s)]
*  as well? I mean, there's just, I was ready for Trump 2.0 to be bad. But this whole element of [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3147.6s)]
*  setting up this Doge team under Elon Musk and having this young group of people that I don't [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3155.12s)]
*  even know if they work for the government or not. They've never been vetted. We don't know [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3159.44s)]
*  their names necessarily. They're just kind of rampaging through agencies, I guess, trying to [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3163.12s)]
*  cut whatever they can whenever they feel like it. And it's just, it's taken us all, I think, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3168.56s)]
*  a minute to catch up with how radical that is. Yeah, that's right. I mean, but also it's so [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3174.4s)]
*  radical that it sort of benefits us because it's not the frog being boiled, right? It's the frog [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3179.52s)]
*  being fried. And so everybody's kind of like, okay, I'm out of my slumber now. There is no [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3187.36s)]
*  there is no ability to relax. There is no ability for anybody to claim, well, why don't you guys [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3193.04s)]
*  give him a chance? Or there's no ability for even the punditocracy to like stroke their chins and [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3198.56s)]
*  say, they're the Democrats go again. I believe they're overreacting. This is no big deal. He's [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3204.48s)]
*  basically a normal Republican, and they're complaining about outcomes. But they don't like [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3210.48s)]
*  the outcome. So they're saying democracy is at stake. Nobody can credibly claim that what's [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3215.44s)]
*  happening is, is legal. And they have a very specific theory of action, which is, you know, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3221.12s)]
*  as they talked about, you know, muzzle speed, flood the zone. But you know, that's a fancy [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3228.56s)]
*  way of saying we're gonna do a ton of illegal stuff at the same time, and see if like one or [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3234.4s)]
*  two of them will stick. And, you know, I thought Ezra Klein last Sunday wrote a very nice piece [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3239.92s)]
*  called Don't Believe Him. And I think he got criticized, you know, by the internet for [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3245.84s)]
*  for being for like being too casual about the Trump presidency. And that's not how I took it. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3253.2000000000003s)]
*  I think we should be totally alarmed. But we also shouldn't concede our power away, either our [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3258.6400000000003s)]
*  people power, or our ability to win in the courts or our ability to at least gum up the works [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3264.96s)]
*  legislatively. There's this sense that the coolest thing on the left to do is to catastrophize and [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3270.4s)]
*  say we've already lost, that the democrats are hopeless, that the movement is dead, and that [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3276.08s)]
*  ha ha ha ha ha. I'm so left that I don't even want to participate in the left anymore. And I think [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3281.36s)]
*  everyone's like normal people who want to fight for our democracy and fight for our country are [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3287.6s)]
*  saying, yeah, enough of that bullshit. Activism is not just getting into someone's replies and [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3292.0s)]
*  saying, why aren't you fighting harder? It's figuring out how you personally can fight harder. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3297.12s)]
*  And I think one of the places that I've seen over the last week, you know, real courage is within [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3302.0s)]
*  the federal government, a bunch of people are starting to disobey, or I should say, decline [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3307.6s)]
*  to execute illegal orders, to establish themselves as whistleblowers, to stand in front of federal [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3314.96s)]
*  buildings and protest, which is not risk free. But I think once you start to see each other, [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3323.2s)]
*  right, there really is strength and safety in numbers. And I don't want to get too philosophical [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3329.52s)]
*  about this, but I just do think there's something very important about showing up in real life when [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3335.7599999999998s)]
*  you start to see each other on the street and not just intermediated through an app that you go, [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3340.72s)]
*  okay, I got friends here, this is real. I'm in. Let's go. We're going to win this thing. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3346.16s)]
*  We may be getting our butts kicked for the next six weeks. But six weeks is not six years. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3353.04s)]
*  And other Americans have faced other challenges to the American experiment. And they did not simply [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3359.36s)]
*  tweet, we're cooked. They fought like hell. And they continued the experiment. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3366.7999999999997s)]
*  You and I both spend some time on Twitter. I think I know the kind of frustration you're [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3371.52s)]
*  feeling, the kind of tone you're talking about where people are somehow blaming the Democratic [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3375.76s)]
*  Party for everything that Donald Trump is doing. And it's exhausting. It's frustrating. But let's [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3380.6400000000003s)]
*  just sort of talk about the tension and the anger. I mean, Democrats are pretty angry right now. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3385.92s)]
*  We're angry at Trump, angry at what he's doing. We're angry at Joe Biden for putting us in this [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3389.76s)]
*  place. And as you mentioned, a lot of people are lashing out at Democrats in Congress for not doing [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3394.2400000000002s)]
*  more. So help me just set expectations a bit. What power do Democrats in the Senate actually have? [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3400.8s)]
*  What can we do to block some of Trump's actions? And what is just going to have to be messaging to [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3408.0s)]
*  create a political cost down the road to some of the things Trump is doing? [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3414.0s)]
*  Well, think of it this way. There are certain things that need, you know, 51 votes and certain [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3418.6400000000003s)]
*  things that need 60. So anytime it's 51 votes, all we can do is make our best case and delay [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3423.76s)]
*  them a little. And by a little, I mean 15 minutes, 27 minutes, 45 minutes, sometimes not at all. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3430.16s)]
*  And, you know, we can make a nuisance of ourselves in small ways, but that's not really changing [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3438.08s)]
*  either public opinion or the situation on the ground. They're not getting their cabinet any [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3442.64s)]
*  slower if we do minor procedural roadblocks. And by the way, we are doing all of the, you know, [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3447.44s)]
*  in and out of a quorum call or in and out of executive session. But there's no magic bullet [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3452.7999999999997s)]
*  called slow them down. Remember that the people talking about Mitch McConnell's obstructionism [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3457.92s)]
*  are talking about an era when the cabinet needed 60 votes. Now the cabinet needs 51 and they've [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3463.44s)]
*  got 53. So everybody needs to understand they're very likely to get their entire cabinet. And all [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3470.2400000000002s)]
*  we can do is scream bloody murder about how dangerous this is. Then there comes a point [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3476.96s)]
*  this year, and it's not that long from now, when they need 60 votes for regular legislation. And [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3481.52s)]
*  that's when Democrats are very relevant, because they need seven more than 53. And that's when the [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3486.88s)]
*  Democratic senators can exert some authority and use some leverage. I'm not prepared to sort of [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3492.8s)]
*  tell you exactly how we're going to do that, because, frankly, we have to become united. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3500.0s)]
*  And that's a leadership call. That's a joint decision. But we're not casual about those [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3505.76s)]
*  moments in time when we actually do have like raw leverage to push back on what's happening. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3513.12s)]
*  Right now, we have very little ability to stop them. And the best thing we can do is, as you say, [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3519.52s)]
*  make them own these votes. I do not think the RFK Jr. Yes vote is going to age well. I don't think [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3527.12s)]
*  the Pete Hegseth vote is going to age well, obviously, Kash Patel and all the rest of it. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3536.08s)]
*  But I'll also just say that, to be fair to folks who are frustrated, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3541.2799999999997s)]
*  they're not sure what we're supposed to be doing, but they know we're not supposed to be doing [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3548.72s)]
*  nothing. And so one of the reasons that people were, I think, fired up at this 30 hours on the [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3552.48s)]
*  floor is like, it was something. We're fighting, we're showing some fight, we understand the urgency [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3558.24s)]
*  of the moment. But it's like the old Steve Jobs used to say, people don't know what they want [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3563.2799999999997s)]
*  until you show it to them. It is not their job to say, why don't you put the Senate in a quorum [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3570.88s)]
*  call? Because I take that as a, I'm at the end of my rope, would you please tell me what you're [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3576.0s)]
*  doing here? And let me just tell you my theory of change here. Yes, we can come up the works and we [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3581.36s)]
*  should. Yes, we will have actual raw leverage on the vote count later. And we should use that [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3587.6s)]
*  as ruthlessly and aggressively as we can. I also think, you know, let's not underestimate [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3593.84s)]
*  the power of the federal courts to declare, and this is already born fruit, what the President of [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3600.1600000000003s)]
*  the United States is doing as flatly illegal, and to enjoin and stop those actions. And then I think [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3606.08s)]
*  we also have to, together, as citizens, build a mass movement. Because when you're fighting [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3614.7200000000003s)]
*  autocracy, and you know this as well as anybody, you need the legitimacy of people on your side. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3620.32s)]
*  So it's not just us fighting and then people either cheering us on or not cheering us on, [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3627.52s)]
*  you know, on social media. People need to see each other in three dimensions. It has to be [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3633.04s)]
*  tens of thousands of people. It has to be peaceful. We have to have the moral high ground. But the way [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3637.36s)]
*  to beat autocracy is not just like legislative maneuvering, it's actual people power. And let's [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3643.52s)]
*  not forget that. Yeah, that's well said. And I agree with you. I think that RFK vote is going to [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3650.56s)]
*  age like a vat of raw milk that might be available on store soon. Let's talk about you personally. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3656.48s)]
*  One way you have used your power is you've put a hold on all of Trump's State Department nominees [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3662.08s)]
*  over this Elon Musk led effort to illegally gut USAID. Can you give listeners just a quick [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3667.2s)]
*  explanation of what does that mean in practice? And also, like, what are you asking Trump to do [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3674.16s)]
*  that will get you to release these holds going forward? A lot of these nominations are mandatory [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3680.64s)]
*  two hours. And so that doesn't sound like a long time, but there are, you know, hundreds and hundreds [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3687.9199999999996s)]
*  of them. So when, for instance, Tuberville held up all the military nominations, these are like a [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3694.0s)]
*  two star becoming a three star, or a thousand of them. And some folks were like, why don't you go [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3699.36s)]
*  to the floor and just start plowing through them? And the answer is because it's 1000 nominations [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3704.8s)]
*  times two hours, we would have been in the Senate for a year and a half confirming a bunch of, [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3710.32s)]
*  you know, rear admirals, and literally have no time for anything else. And so it does gum up [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3716.88s)]
*  their ability to get ambassadors and assistant secretaries through but anyone they really want [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3722.8s)]
*  to get through, they just allocate the time and do it. And my I haven't actually said this anywhere [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3728.88s)]
*  else, because I just issued the press release sort of without going through too much of a [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3734.32s)]
*  internal policy planning program. Okay, I just very Trumpy interview. I like it. Well, [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3739.36s)]
*  wasn't quite Trumpy. I mean, with me when I just told him this is what I wanted to do. Look, [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3744.0800000000004s)]
*  I am actually a little more willing than people may know to have a negotiation about how USAID [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3749.6s)]
*  is done. And I think that it's not unreasonable to ask the question if we've got the Belt and Road, [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3757.68s)]
*  and everybody watches what China is doing, and says, wow, that's really smart that they're all [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3764.88s)]
*  around the world helping folks, but it's also aligned with their economic and, you know, [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3769.36s)]
*  geopolitical geostrategic objectives. USAID does some of that, but there's an argument, [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3773.92s)]
*  and it's been on a bipartisan basis that sometimes USAID is even at cross purposes with the State [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3780.32s)]
*  Department. So I'm open to better alignment. I'm also open to the idea that we should reduce [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3785.76s)]
*  overhead. I think wherever we can reduce overhead, we should. And I'm also open to the idea that, [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3793.84s)]
*  yes, there's some civil society stuff that we should be funding, but, you know, I'm not sure [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3799.44s)]
*  we should ever fund an opera overseas if we haven't gotten everybody who needs a mosquito net, [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3804.56s)]
*  a mosquito net. So I am actually open-minded to reforms if they're done through, you know, [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3811.2000000000003s)]
*  a regular legislative process. I've just told everybody I will only arrive at the negotiating [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3817.76s)]
*  table once the agency is reopened. And right now they're shuttering the whole place. I mean, [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3824.24s)]
*  just flatly, legally, it is an extraordinary thing they're doing. They are bringing, you know, [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3830.08s)]
*  thousands and thousands of patriotic Americans, skilled Americans, who have set up a life in [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3837.04s)]
*  wherever it is, right, in Asia or South America or Central America or Africa or wherever it is. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3843.68s)]
*  They brought their family there. And then they just got this email saying, [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3850.1600000000003s)]
*  you're coming home within the next 30 days. It's just a rotten thing to do to humans. But also, [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3853.76s)]
*  you know, we may end up with eight people from our primary development agency in all of Asia. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3859.84s)]
*  Like, this is nuts. There's, you know, Marburg's disease in Tanzania. There's Ebola in Uganda. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3866.7200000000003s)]
*  And so I actually think this is going to back up on Donald Trump. And I know there's some [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3875.2799999999997s)]
*  conventional wisdom knocking around that foreign aid people don't care about it. And I stipulate [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3880.72s)]
*  to the idea that if you took a poll, most people would not rank foreign aid as their top priority. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3885.6s)]
*  But it's one of those things where, like, also people wouldn't rank the FAA as their top priority. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3892.16s)]
*  People don't rank food inspections as their top priority until any of those things cause a [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3897.3599999999997s)]
*  disruption at home, a lack of stability and safety at home. And I think, you know, these diseases [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3903.8399999999997s)]
*  know no political or geographic boundaries. And this is a very serious situation. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3910.64s)]
*  – Yeah, no, look, I understand this. I have the same sort of tension in my head as you do where [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3916.96s)]
*  I worked in the national security world. I've seen the amazing good that organizations funded by USAID [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3922.7999999999997s)]
*  can do. I've also seen the agency as a whole feel bureaucratic and slow, and it can be frustrating [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3929.68s)]
*  at times. But you're right. I mean, there are specific examples of programs being run by USAID, [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3937.44s)]
*  like tracking highly contagious, deadly diseases all around the world. You mentioned, too, [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3943.9199999999996s)]
*  Marburg, which is like Ebola without a vaccine, basically, is sort of how it's been described to [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3950.7999999999997s)]
*  me. There's Ebola, there's this bird flu outbreak that seems to be everywhere all of a sudden. And [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3955.12s)]
*  if suddenly we're just flying blind to this stuff and you can trace it back to cuts to USAID, that is [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3960.4s)]
*  an incredibly powerful message. – Yeah, I mean, look, I mean, I'm not rooting for Donald Trump, [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3965.52s)]
*  but I am trying to solve this problem. And so, you know, one of the things I've said to Republican [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3972.08s)]
*  colleagues is like, I get that foreign aid is not on the top of your list, except when we have our [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3977.2799999999997s)]
*  first Ebola case, you know, in the United States. And so, and people are going to say, wait, what [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3982.88s)]
*  the hell, we don't monitor this anymore? Or, you know, PEPFAR is shut down, and PEPFAR is shut down. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3987.76s)]
*  The HIV AIDS Prevention Program, which has saved tens of millions of lives, is shut down. It's [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3993.28s)]
*  technically not, but the problem is that, you know, everyone's shut out of their email. Literally, [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=3999.52s)]
*  people can't even operate. They've been sent home, and nominally, in order to like pretend to [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4006.6400000000003s)]
*  not violate federal civil service laws and other laws, they're saying, we'll still pay you, please [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4013.04s)]
*  work from home. But then they shut them out of their emails, which I, by the way, is, you know, [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4018.6400000000003s)]
*  I'm not a lawyer, but I'm smart enough to understand this. It's one thing to send people [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4023.84s)]
*  home to telework, but if you don't have a reason to do that, and then you shut them out of their [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4028.7200000000003s)]
*  ability to work, then it's all a pretext, right? And then you are just de facto shutting down the [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4034.08s)]
*  agency. And that's why I'm very, very confident that this will also be found to be in violation [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4039.52s)]
*  of the law. But this one in particular, USAID, it's an arson job, right? The other ones, they're [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4045.28s)]
*  trying to see what they can get away with. NSF, Small Business Administration, VA, and it's really [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4051.68s)]
*  super damaging. This one, they want to, I think they know they only have a couple more days before [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4057.2s)]
*  the full freakout happens with the media and international attention. And by the way, we have, [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4062.08s)]
*  sorry to get all fired up here, but we have the Munich Security Conference next week. We have a [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4067.6s)]
*  bipartisan delegation of United States senators. JD Vance is going to be there. I'm assuming [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4071.92s)]
*  Secretary Rubio is going to be there. All we're going to spend our time doing is getting yelled [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4076.7999999999997s)]
*  at. Why did you shut off the primary arm of goodwill internationally? So usually the Munich [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4081.2799999999997s)]
*  Security Conference is a three-dimensional example of why America remains the indispensable nation. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4088.7999999999997s)]
*  Everybody's hanging on our every word. Everyone wants to know what direction we're going in. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4095.76s)]
*  And I think it's not going to be that. I think we're going to get, just, I mean, people will be [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4101.76s)]
*  polite, some of them. But whether it's Africa or Asia or Central Europe or anywhere else, [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4106.16s)]
*  people are just getting, the first item on their list when we have our bilateral meetings is, [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4113.68s)]
*  what the hell did you do to PEPFAR? What the hell did you do to disease prevention? What the hell [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4118.400000000001s)]
*  did you do to foreign military financing or any of the economic supports? This is such small money [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4122.96s)]
*  in the scheme of things that we need to understand it for what it is. It is not a budget or fiscal [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4128.96s)]
*  question. This is a, this is a America first policy, right? This, what they want is for us to [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4134.96s)]
*  recede from the rest of the world. They want our government to be about half as big. They want it [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4144.16s)]
*  to do way fewer things. And they want, I mean, it is a quite radical vision. They don't want FEMA to [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4150.0s)]
*  exist. They think the FAA should have AI doing air traffic control. I mean, it's a very creepy, [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4157.12s)]
*  radical vision. And I'm not sure Donald Trump cares one way or another about all this, but he [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4165.52s)]
*  is letting these, you know, combination of these sort of, you know, oligarch tech dudes and whatever, [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4171.6s)]
*  and some old school right wing think tank people just kind of have the run of the place. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4177.84s)]
*  Yeah. And just on the foreign APs, I mean, a lot of this is money that has been dispersed and is [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4184.64s)]
*  budgeted, you know, and if we are helping fund some major component of the government in Jordan, [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4189.4400000000005s)]
*  for example, we can like rug pull them once on actually providing that funding before we lose [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4195.28s)]
*  our influence with that government and in that country forever. So this is incredibly damaging [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4201.84s)]
*  no matter how it kind of ends. But you mentioned your Republican colleagues. I mean, look, they [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4206.64s)]
*  like foreign aid when it's in the form of bombs. They might not talk about, you know, USAID, [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4210.320000000001s)]
*  but they think they know it's valuable. And there's also some Republicans in the Senate that we know [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4216.400000000001s)]
*  hate Donald Trump, like Mitch McConnell hates Donald Trump, famously so. Not enough to do [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4221.360000000001s)]
*  anything about it, but he doesn't like him. Susan Collins is now complaining publicly about [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4225.76s)]
*  Elon Musk's role being inappropriate. In conversations with them, do you think this [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4230.72s)]
*  is going to shape up being like the first term where these guys kind of grumble on background, [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4237.280000000001s)]
*  but then refuse to use their power to change anything or people getting more worked up? [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4242.0s)]
*  Like, how do you read this? I don't know. I just don't know. I've certainly had conversations with, [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4247.12s)]
*  I mean, seven to 10 Republicans who have a real stomachache about this thing in particular, [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4254.160000000001s)]
*  because as much as I disagree with many of them about almost everything, a lot of them don't want, [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4261.360000000001s)]
*  you know, babies dying on their conscience. And the question is whether they're going to [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4269.4400000000005s)]
*  exert themselves. So this weekend, Republican senators are going to be meeting with the [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4274.320000000001s)]
*  president. And we'll see. I mean, you know, I think it's not a, I mean, it's probably a safe bet to [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4277.52s)]
*  assume, no, they will not step up. And even if like handicapping wise, maybe I still think [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4285.200000000001s)]
*  there will be instances where they stand up for, you know, what they think is important. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4291.280000000001s)]
*  I think there has to be more time elapsed. And one of the conversations I'm having with, [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4296.320000000001s)]
*  you know, some folks is, I don't think the question is time elapsed. I think it is [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4300.64s)]
*  damage done. And if they're doing the damage super quickly, you may not have six months. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4305.28s)]
*  But I think there's also a human psychology element, which is, if it sort of piles up over [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4311.599999999999s)]
*  six months, it's easier to get there to displaying your independence. If it all happens at once, [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4316.88s)]
*  it looks like to them, you know, you're immediately turning on the newly inaugurated president. So [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4322.0s)]
*  they've got a tightrope to walk. Some of them do that more skillfully and frankly, [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4327.28s)]
*  more honorably than others. And, you know, my job is obviously to articulate, to try to slow them [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4332.24s)]
*  down, to articulate to the public, you know, where I think the country is going in the wrong [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4338.8s)]
*  direction. And that part on some level is the easy part. But I still, you know, I'm still trying to [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4344.32s)]
*  find three or four votes for certain things, because that is the job. And I think we should all [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4349.92s)]
*  hope that our Democratic senators are in the business of describing how horrific all this is, [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4357.68s)]
*  in the business of trying to slow it down, but also in the business of trying to do the senator [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4363.2s)]
*  thing, which is to find four votes to stop all this crazy shit. And if it if it is if we're unable [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4368.48s)]
*  to do so, then then at least we know that we've exhausted the possibility and that we can go, [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4373.84s)]
*  you know, rhetorically speaking, full thermonuclear. Yeah, let's talk about the [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4380.72s)]
*  Democratic Party right now, because we don't have a leader right now. Right. Like we have former [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4384.4s)]
*  presidents, we have congressional leaders, but there's not like a single person guiding the party [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4387.759999999999s)]
*  on messaging and policy like you would have if there were a Democrat in the White House or a [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4393.04s)]
*  major nominee running for president. And on top of that, a lot of the Republican leadership [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4397.759999999999s)]
*  is getting up there. They don't seem particularly fluent in digital media platforms. The messaging [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4403.92s)]
*  can feel a little behind the eight ball. Now, I'm saying this to you because you're an exception [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4410.64s)]
*  to this. You are young and an effective communicator and someone who understands [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4414.64s)]
*  like how to communicate in twenty twenty five. And I'm just wondering for people who are like, [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4420.400000000001s)]
*  look, a lot of us are getting the cringy clips on the group chat. What do you say to them [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4425.92s)]
*  about the way you are pushing Democrats to evolve and get better and be more nimble? [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4430.88s)]
*  Look, I remember there was a lot of that kind of chatter about Nancy Pelosi as she was speaker. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4436.56s)]
*  And then there were various moments during which we went, ah, she's really very good at this. And I [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4442.080000000001s)]
*  just Chuck Schumer is really very good at this. Is it true that he's new to the Internet age? Sure. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4449.92s)]
*  But so am I, frankly. So I just worry about the theater criticism part of the job. Right. Like, [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4457.200000000001s)]
*  but like it's a theater critic. Look, there's good messaging and there's bad. Right. Like there's a [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4464.0s)]
*  the harder part is getting it to the people who need to hear it. And maybe if it's so cringy, [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4469.36s)]
*  it gets to them. That's good. But like, you know, there's like the corny ass chance. Like we can all [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4472.88s)]
*  just agree that maybe that's not going to cut it. Right. Well, let me let me answer the question [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4477.28s)]
*  this way. You know, Chuck has designated Cory Booker and Tina Smith to kind of get us to be [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4482.24s)]
*  better at digital. And look, I think you're exactly identifying the problem, which is [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4490.64s)]
*  we can say exactly the right thing, but if nobody sees it, it doesn't matter. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4499.4400000000005s)]
*  And the problem with the kind of battle tested way of doing things from the past is you pull a thing [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4502.96s)]
*  among the things on the list of things you pulled, you pick the one that's at 70 and not 67 and not [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4511.280000000001s)]
*  64. And then you say the thing that pulls the best. The problem with that model is it's very [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4517.44s)]
*  likely that the thing that pulls the best is also the thing that is the least offensive, [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4523.599999999999s)]
*  because that's why it pulls the best. So it's really a kind of lowest common denominator. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4528.48s)]
*  Which thing do you find least objectionable? And that might work if you're in the mode of making [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4532.5599999999995s)]
*  a television commercial and basically forcing it into the brains of a bunch of viewers, [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4538.4s)]
*  but it will not go viral because it's definitionally not interesting. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4543.84s)]
*  It's boring. Yeah. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4547.2s)]
*  And so that's where I think Trump is brilliant, right? They're eating the dogs, they're eating [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4548.96s)]
*  the cats. That was offensive. It hurt him in the short run, but he again surfaced the question [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4554.88s)]
*  of immigration. And what happens is he suffers for two days looking like an idiot. But then on [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4562.0s)]
*  the third day, people go, yeah, but you know, he's got a point about immigration. And then we're [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4568.24s)]
*  talking about the thing that he wanted us to talk about. So his ability to command attention [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4572.4s)]
*  is not a trivial thing. Now we have a structural problem, as you pointed out, [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4577.5199999999995s)]
*  when you're out of power, you just definitionally don't have a leader until you have a nominee, [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4581.28s)]
*  right? We could say it's the Democratic Party Chairman, we could say it's Chuck, [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4585.5199999999995s)]
*  we could say it's Hakeem, but the truth is, there's not going to be a one person who leads our party [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4589.2s)]
*  out of the wilderness. It's got to be all of us together. But I will say, like, we're all getting [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4593.759999999999s)]
*  better at communicating online and understanding that, yeah, cable hits are important. But like, [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4598.72s)]
*  there's very, very few undecided voters who are watching any of the cable shows. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4604.16s)]
*  Right. It's not that we shouldn't do those anymore. It's just that we should think of those as one of [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4610.4800000000005s)]
*  the tactics in our toolkit. And just by virtue of metrics, we are doing, I mean, like fivefold, [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4615.2s)]
*  eightfold better than we did even three weeks ago, because there's a commitment, not just from the [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4622.64s)]
*  digital native members of the Senate, but some others who are like newly willing to be authentic [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4628.8s)]
*  and speak plainly. And like, you know, because part of it too, is like, you got hearings, [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4635.92s)]
*  and you got votes, and you got meetings, and you got everything else, you have to actually allocate [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4641.28s)]
*  time to like staring into an iPhone and saying, here's what I'm up to. It's weird. Yes. But it's [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4645.68s)]
*  a but it's a and I actually had to tell my staff, like, we're doing this thing, you have to grab me, [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4650.08s)]
*  even if it's just while I'm walking to the floor, stick a camera in my face and make me start [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4655.28s)]
*  talking. And so we're doing that more. And it's starting to work. We also need to over time, [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4659.36s)]
*  build a bigger ecosystem of, you know, progressive media. And it's not exclusively well, [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4666.88s)]
*  I like what you're saying right now. Keep going. I didn't mean to cut you off, [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4673.599999999999s)]
*  showing up. But it's also kind of the the the network effect of like you went on barstool, [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4677.04s)]
*  right? It's the it's the recognition that think of it like your high school buddies, you do not, [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4685.6s)]
*  I don't exclude anybody who like thinks RFK is junior is great. You might argue with them, [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4692.24s)]
*  or you might never talk about it. But you just try to find common ground and try to build [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4698.72s)]
*  community because I think one of the things Trump did in the last election that was, [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4703.6s)]
*  you know, kind of brilliant, right is you can talk yourself out of Tulsi Gabbard's base mattering, [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4707.4400000000005s)]
*  because you can take a poll and go, Oh, that's only 1%. And then you could do the same thing [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4714.0s)]
*  with RFK and say, that's only two and a half percent. Well, holy shit, we only lost by 1.5%. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4719.120000000001s)]
*  And so coalitions that work, and you were part of the maybe most powerful coalition in on the [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4724.88s)]
*  Democratic side, in recent memory, are always like on policy and on politics kind of contradictory. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4730.32s)]
*  And we became the party that like wouldn't accept anyone with a weird idea wouldn't accept anybody [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4737.599999999999s)]
*  with without like a kind of down the middle view that was totally rational and totally acceptable. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4743.44s)]
*  And I think we have to be a party that says, Look, if you've got some heterodox views, [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4750.48s)]
*  if you've got even some offensive views, we still want you in the in the tent, right? Like, [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4755.36s)]
*  one of the reasons to see in the state of Hawaii, Democrats are so powerful is we have [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4760.639999999999s)]
*  conservative Democrats, right? We just like welcome them, because we figure a better you're [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4764.4s)]
*  a conservative Democrat than a moderate Republican. And I tell you what, your listeners are gonna hate [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4769.839999999999s)]
*  this. I miss Joe Manchin. Right? I miss his vote. Not his personality. But yeah, miss his vote. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4776.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, the houseboat seem nice to his votes. I mean, I actually like his personality better [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4782.88s)]
*  than his votes. But but um, but I still like we would be thrilled to have three or four Joe [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4786.88s)]
*  Manchin's so we could all be frustrated at the fact that he doesn't vote like a like a Hawaii [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4793.360000000001s)]
*  Democrat. But at least he votes to make Chuck Schumer the leader correct and, and puts Patty [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4798.72s)]
*  Murray in charge of appropriations and put Ron Wyden in front of in charge of tax, and Martin [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4805.360000000001s)]
*  Heinrich in charge of energy and all the and Sheldon Whitehouse in charge of the environment [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4810.88s)]
*  and public works. Like that's what matters in the end. And so we have to kind of like, [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4816.16s)]
*  we have to decide, do we want to win? I remember talking to a buddy of mine who, [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4820.8s)]
*  who was in the Hawaii legislature, and the magic number in the Hawaii legislature to become the [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4826.72s)]
*  speaker is 26 out of 51. So you need 26 votes. And he was at 22. And, and it was really hard to get [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4831.44s)]
*  to 26. And we had a private conversation about a group of people who he found to be kind of [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4841.28s)]
*  objectionable. And I said, Well, what the fuck, man, do you want to win and try to get to 26, [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4848.24s)]
*  with no objectionable people, you can't do it. So you have to make deals, arrangements, promises, [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4855.44s)]
*  with people that don't agree with you. And that's the way we're going to rebuild this political [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4861.759999999999s)]
*  party is we're going to have to aggressively welcome people into our tent. It doesn't mean we [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4866.799999999999s)]
*  abandon our core values. It just means that one of our core values is to exercise power on behalf of [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4870.96s)]
*  people. And we can't do that unless we actually win some damned elections. And people do not like [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4877.599999999999s)]
*  being scolded out of the tent. And that was definitely the vibe for a while. And I think [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4883.52s)]
*  we've kind of shook off those cobwebs. Look, I love what you're saying. I've noticed that a [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4888.56s)]
*  lot of you, you and a lot of your colleagues are taking reps, recording things that you're just [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4894.88s)]
*  posting on tik tok or on Twitter or wherever just trying to get out there talk more, explain what's [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4899.76s)]
*  going on. I think it's I think that's great. I think you're right, we cannot rely on MSNBC hits [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4905.120000000001s)]
*  because those people are old and already agree with us. I could not agree more with the need to [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4910.8s)]
*  go to different places. Like I hope I once said Democrats should never go on Fox. I'm wrong. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4916.08s)]
*  People should we should go on Fox. We should pick fights. We should be interesting. We should make [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4921.52s)]
*  content that is compelling to watch because there is tension in it. And people should go on like [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4925.28s)]
*  Barstool sports shows or other places that I think were seen as not kosher. And that's not because [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4929.6s)]
*  you agree with everything Dave Portnoy thinks or said. It's because that's not a standard that [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4936.08s)]
*  we apply anywhere else. You know what I mean? Like I don't judge like ESPN talent based on what [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4940.64s)]
*  John Skipper's political views are when back when he was in charge of ESPN. He's not anymore. It's [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4946.96s)]
*  someone else who I forget his name. But anyway, so I think that's great. One thing I just would love [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4952.56s)]
*  to get a sense from you on is, okay, you were re we're worst NFL team. We're in a full rebuild. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4957.52s)]
*  We're tanking to get the draft picks. We're firing the coach new GM quarterback is [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4965.12s)]
*  doing ayahuasca somewhere. What three things do you want people to think of when they think [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4970.72s)]
*  of the Democratic Party? Like what are the three core values that is part of our rebrand? [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4975.36s)]
*  Economic fairness and fighting corruption and standing up for each other and the standing up [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4981.76s)]
*  for each other. I think let's be honest. I did this on the fly. I just think economic [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4990.48s)]
*  fairness is very straightforward. And the billionaires on the stage in front of the cabinet [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=4997.5199999999995s)]
*  was I think a gift to us because it put three dimensions around what we think is happening. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=5003.12s)]
*  And they're about to move forward with a massive tax cut. They're obviously trying to almost [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=5008.879999999999s)]
*  literally raid the Treasury and shut down critical services. So that's relatively easy to talk about. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=5013.36s)]
*  And I just think, you know, the we are no longer the party in power. And so we need to fight against [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=5020.08s)]
*  the power structure and not defend all the elite institutions. These people are at the helm. And [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=5027.76s)]
*  the corruption story is both true and alarming. But it's also something that attracts swing voters [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=5033.92s)]
*  and attract some of the voters that liked Barack Obama, and then swung over to Trump because they [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=5041.92s)]
*  wanted someone who was going to kick these politicians in the stomach. Right. And then [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=5048.16s)]
*  the third thing, and forgive me for not having the precise words, but it is just a little bit [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=5053.68s)]
*  of belief in each other. Right. This core value that we're building a mass movement to like [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=5058.72s)]
*  actually envision something different and to forgive each other our past political or personal [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=5067.76s)]
*  transgressions to be welcoming and coalition building in a way that I think we you know, [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=5073.68s)]
*  is going to make all of us a little uncomfortable because we're going to be so fucking pissed. Right. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=5079.360000000001s)]
*  Now you realize Trump's an idiot. I know. And we got to be nice to those people. We got to be nice [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=5084.400000000001s)]
*  to those people. And I've been having like, you know, I've been having a bunch of those conversations [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=5089.92s)]
*  with folks. And remember that people move from, you know, in favor of somebody to a little bit [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=5095.200000000001s)]
*  less in favor of somebody to undecided and then they join you. They never flip. Right. Because [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=5102.96s)]
*  it's just psychologically too hard to go like, holy shit, I was wrong about everything. Some people [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=5109.2s)]
*  might do that. But for the most part, you're moving them over in a way that allows them to [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=5113.6s)]
*  not feel stupid, not feel put upon, not feel like they're being told that they were wrong. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=5119.36s)]
*  And like that is honestly like just millions of people who listen to podcasts and are politically [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=5124.4800000000005s)]
*  engaged. One of the most important things we can do is win people over like one by one. I believe [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=5131.04s)]
*  that I know that there's a little bit of like, almost technocratic, like data driven campaign [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=5136.0s)]
*  stuff where it's like it's all person to person conversations. But at this stage, we're not in a [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=5142.4s)]
*  campaign. And we do just need to create a little room for people to to say, by the way, people all [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=5147.2s)]
*  the time misremember who they voted for. The worse Trump gets, the fewer people will remember that [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=5153.76s)]
*  they voted for him. There's also a category of people I talked to a buddy who was describing [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=5159.44s)]
*  his friends who are Republicans. And they said, you know, they they voted for Trump because they [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=5164.719999999999s)]
*  were pissed about Biden and prices and his age. But they're not fans of Trump. And they're going [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=5170.96s)]
*  to give him a relatively short leash before they abandoned him. And so those are those are real [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=5176.719999999999s)]
*  opportunities for us. If we can just appear to be somewhat welcoming, and not just turn this into a [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=5182.639999999999s)]
*  I can't believe you allow this guy to take the helm and now you want to join us. Yeah. The answer [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=5189.44s)]
*  is everybody's welcome. And I don't give a shit what your views used to be how you voted. This is [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=5194.16s)]
*  the biggest possible tent right now, because in my view, everything is at stake. I agree. Those are [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY1JxfUwDc&t=5200.639999999999s)]
