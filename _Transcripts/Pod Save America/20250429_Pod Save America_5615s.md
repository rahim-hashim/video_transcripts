Video Description: The good news: Trump's second term has already hit historic levels of unpopularity. The bad news: we're still only 100 days into it. The White House marks this milestone by bragging about its record on immigration and defending the arrest of a Wisconsin judge and the deportation of three very young American citizens, ages 2, 4, and 7. Jon, Lovett, and Tommy reflect on where the country stands at the 100-day mark and take stock of the opposition—as Democrats, media outlets, universities, and even some law firms all ratchet up their efforts to push back. Then, Dan sits down with Neera Tanden, President and CEO of the Center for American Progress and a former top advisor to Joe Biden and Barack Obama, about the unique dangers of Trump and his allies, and how to defend against them.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Trump's Polls PLUMMET To Historic Lows After Chaotic First 100 Days
**Pod Save America:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io)
*  And we're a rebellious and freedom-loving and democracy-loving bunch. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=0.0s)]
*  And maybe we're a little bit, we're a little soft and a little decadent, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  but like we'll find our footing and we'll fight back and we'll win. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=7.24s)]
*  And he can't take this country from us. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=9.4s)]
*  And I feel like that energy is starting to appear more and more. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=11.16s)]
*  You see it at protests. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=13.88s)]
*  You see the people showing up at rallies and town halls. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=14.68s)]
*  And so that has made me feel like the question, like, is the door, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  did the door lock behind us? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=21.2s)]
*  And I think the answer is still no. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=22.64s)]
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Jon Favreau. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=23.84s)]
*  I'm Jon Lovett. I'm Tommy Vitor. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=25.72s)]
*  On today's show, we are somehow only 100 days into Donald Trump's second term. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=27.279999999999998s)]
*  And the only promising news is that just about all the polling is now showing [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=31.68s)]
*  that the president and his agenda and his party have already reached [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=35.24s)]
*  historic levels of unpopularity in just three months. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=39.0s)]
*  We'll talk about where things stand, how we're feeling and the state of the opposition. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=42.44s)]
*  Then you'll hear the conversation that Dan had when we were in D.C. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=46.16s)]
*  with our old friend, Neera Tanden, who's once again running the Center for American Progress. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=48.76s)]
*  But let's start with what the White House wants to be talking about on day one [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=53.92s)]
*  of what they're calling 100 days week. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=56.8s)]
*  What? Yes, yes, Tommy. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=60.32s)]
*  Seriously calling it 100 days week. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  So it's like it's it's the 100th day, but then it's a week of days. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=65.39999999999999s)]
*  I wonder if it's like 100 days a month. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  Again, how do you do the math there? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=70.88s)]
*  Just beaten by the dumbest motherfuckers on earth. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=72.67999999999999s)]
*  A friend of mine, we sure are. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=75.24s)]
*  A friend of mine is on a jury and it's federal or it's in a federal building. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=76.8s)]
*  And he went to report for jury duty and there was a notice on the front of the DOJ. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  Saying that they hadn't been paying their water bill [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=86.68s)]
*  and that the water is going to be turned off starting next week. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=88.76s)]
*  Feels like that's an Elon question. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=92.68s)]
*  An Elon question. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=94.68s)]
*  They doze the water. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=95.44000000000001s)]
*  They doze the water off. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=96.4s)]
*  They doze the person that's in charge of paying the bill. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=98.16000000000001s)]
*  They doze the water payment person. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  Anyway, on day one of 100 days a week, they want to talk about deportations. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  They kick things off on Monday morning by putting signs all over the White House [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=107.56s)]
*  lawn that had photos of people they've deported, along with the crimes they've committed. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=110.84s)]
*  I'm sure Stephen Miller was out there in the middle of the night putting up the signs. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=114.68s)]
*  He was doing Photoshop. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=118.36s)]
*  He was making these himself. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=120.64s)]
*  I mean, doing something. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  Doing something. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=122.44s)]
*  I was going to say, that's how he gets excited. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=123.12s)]
*  Not pictured on the lawn were three small American kids [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=125.36s)]
*  the administration just deported. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=128.8s)]
*  A two year old, a four year old and a seven year old. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=130.4s)]
*  All U.S. citizens who were sent out of the country when they showed up [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=133.64000000000001s)]
*  with their mothers for routine immigration check ins in New Orleans. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=136.96s)]
*  The two year old's father is an American citizen [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=140.6s)]
*  who had asked a federal court to keep his daughter with him. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=142.6s)]
*  But before the courthouse could open, the government had already [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=145.68s)]
*  deported the girl and her mother to Honduras. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=148.23999999999998s)]
*  The presiding judge, who is a conservative Trump appointee, said it's, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=150.88s)]
*  quote, illegal and unconstitutional to deport a citizen [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=154.92s)]
*  and scheduled a hearing for May 16th, quote, in the interest of dispelling [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=158.32s)]
*  our strong suspicion that the government just deported a U.S. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=162.84s)]
*  citizen with no meaningful process. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=166.04s)]
*  That is the conservative Trump appointee. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=169.32s)]
*  The four year old and the seven year old are siblings. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  And according to the family's lawyers, the four year old has stage four cancer [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=174.60000000000002s)]
*  and was deported without their medication or the ability [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=179.08s)]
*  to contact their medical team. Stomach churning stuff. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  The other big deportation story is the highly publicized arrest on Friday [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=185.8s)]
*  of a county judge in Wisconsin, Hannah Dugan, who the administration says [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=190.0s)]
*  helped an undocumented immigrant escape from her courthouse [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=194.20000000000002s)]
*  as ICE agents arrived to make an arrest. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=197.24s)]
*  FBI Director Cash Patel essentially live tweeted the arrest [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=199.68s)]
*  and later posted a photo of Dugan being frogmarched to a cop car. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, Attorney General Pam Bondi called Dugan, quote, a criminal judge [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  on a criminal bench and labeled all judges who opposed Trump's immigration [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=210.72s)]
*  crackdown, quote, deranged. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=214.84s)]
*  And here's Border Czar Tom Homan talking about the deported children today. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=217.4s)]
*  If you choose to have a U.S. citizen child knowing you're in this country [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=221.72s)]
*  legally, you put yourself in that position. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=224.72s)]
*  You put your family in that position. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=227.32s)]
*  What we did is remove children with their mothers who requested [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=229.52s)]
*  their children depart with them. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=232.88s)]
*  This is a parental decision. Parenting 101. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=234.12s)]
*  The mothers made that choice. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=238.56s)]
*  And I tell you what, if we didn't do it, the story today be [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=239.96s)]
*  Trump administration separating families again. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=242.96s)]
*  The lawyers for the family said the mothers did not make that choice. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  But let's separate families anyway, Tom. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=249.0s)]
*  So the White House line is basically these weren't deportations. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=252.28s)]
*  These were mothers who chose to take their kids with them. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=256.0s)]
*  You just heard Homan. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=257.8s)]
*  But the Trump judge in Louisiana said in his ruling, basically, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=258.88s)]
*  that he couldn't take that into account until the administration [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=261.8s)]
*  actually proved it in court. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=264.36s)]
*  What do you guys make of all this? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=267.24s)]
*  I mean, I think big picture, it tells you that the process is a rush disaster. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=268.88s)]
*  And the Trump administration doesn't really care. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=273.08000000000004s)]
*  I mean, here, Tom Homan, there is so [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=274.76s)]
*  unapologetic about the human suffering involved in this. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=277.72s)]
*  I think they think it's the price of doing business. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=280.68s)]
*  It's similar to what we saw with the migrants who were sent. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=282.56s)]
*  The Venezuelans were sent to El Salvador, who were just [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=284.84000000000003s)]
*  people who had tattoos who are clearly not members of a gang. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=287.6s)]
*  In 90 percent of the cases. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=291.32000000000005s)]
*  And, you know, in this case, I mean, you have a father. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=293.48s)]
*  Apparently, ICE threatened to arrest the dad, too. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=297.12s)]
*  Yeah. And the dad was allowed a one minute conversation with the mom [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=299.40000000000003s)]
*  while she was in custody before they were deported. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=304.48s)]
*  So, I mean, they're just the I mean, the cruelty is the point has become a cliche. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=307.32000000000005s)]
*  But clearly, they are rushing this process, because as we've read, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=312.6s)]
*  there's a goal of deporting one million people this year. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=316.6s)]
*  I think Tom Homan said today they've deported one hundred thirty eight [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=319.32000000000005s)]
*  thousand so far, so they're behind schedule. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=321.72s)]
*  And so they're just moving as quickly as they can. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=324.36s)]
*  So in the past, look, there are there are undocumented people [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=326.36s)]
*  who have citizen children that creates a horrible circumstance [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=329.88s)]
*  if that person is going to be deported. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=334.0s)]
*  The way he says it is disgusting. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=336.52000000000004s)]
*  He is pointing at the fact that there is inherent cruelty in any immigration system, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=338.44s)]
*  even when it is operating with compassion and decency as much as it can, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=342.6s)]
*  because there are difficult human questions in our immigration system. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=346.8s)]
*  But that's why the lack of due process is so evil and awful. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=351.36s)]
*  These are questions that require humility and compassion and time [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=356.96s)]
*  and attention by people who have the best have some like modicum of of of decency [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=361.32s)]
*  in in dealing with this. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=368.8s)]
*  But for them, there's just two kinds of people like citizens and trendy or agua. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=370.24s)]
*  And so if if this is happening to you, it's your fucking fault. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=374.12s)]
*  And if we do something cruel, it's your fault. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=377.68s)]
*  There's a there's a guy that took a wrong turn. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=379.40000000000003s)]
*  And if you saw this story happened, I think over the weekend or just before [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=382.56s)]
*  the weekend of somebody took a wrong turn and ended up crossing into Canada. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=385.28000000000003s)]
*  It's happening all the time. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=390.12s)]
*  And he's doing uber eats and gets picked up. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=391.56s)]
*  It doesn't it's not clear if it was purposeful or just an error. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=396.68s)]
*  But then the family can't find him. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=399.44s)]
*  Turns out he is in El Salvador, even though he wasn't on the record. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=402.03999999999996s)]
*  So they guess they corrected that. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=405.47999999999996s)]
*  And of course, the the Department of Homeland Security and the spokesperson [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=407.4s)]
*  who was consistently lying throughout this whole process, like no trend, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=410.71999999999997s)]
*  they got him. And the family is like, this is not true. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=413.08s)]
*  And we're desperate to get in contact. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=416.64s)]
*  Only because New York Times investigated to to get this information. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=418.84s)]
*  And I don't know what I've like realizing as just watching all this unfold is how [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=421.32s)]
*  like competence is part of how you show empathy in a society [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=426.96s)]
*  that mistreating people this way, whether it's whether cruelty is the point [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=430.68s)]
*  or just hamfisted fucking morons doesn't really matter [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=434.03999999999996s)]
*  because they are being so callous and reckless with people's lives. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=436.88s)]
*  Yeah, it just didn't. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=440.47999999999996s)]
*  Look, there are there are tough choices you have to make when, like you said, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=441.52s)]
*  there's undocumented immigrants who are getting deported [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=445.0s)]
*  and then their U.S. citizen children. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=447.91999999999996s)]
*  This was not a case where like they didn't apprehend this woman. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=449.12s)]
*  Either of these women. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=453.4s)]
*  They showed up for a check in. Right. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=454.28000000000003s)]
*  So there was no danger there. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=456.24s)]
*  There was it wasn't like criminal conduct there. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=457.28000000000003s)]
*  They were worried about they did not. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=459.2s)]
*  According to the lawyers, families and we'll find out in court later. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=460.52s)]
*  They didn't give them others options. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=462.68s)]
*  They didn't give them time to talk to the fathers or the caregivers or the lawyers. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=465.12s)]
*  And one mother was pregnant. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=468.64s)]
*  There was just there was no reason not to let them contact caregivers [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=471.08s)]
*  or the fathers or anything. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=474.4s)]
*  There was no reason to do it this fast. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=475.36s)]
*  There was no reason to do it before the court. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=476.92s)]
*  There was just no reason to do it like this. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=478.68s)]
*  And now they get into this defensive crouched like they always do, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=481.96000000000004s)]
*  where they're like, oh, do you think we made a mistake? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=485.40000000000003s)]
*  No. Fuck them. It's their problem. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=488.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, they lie. Right. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=489.84000000000003s)]
*  Like Jose Hermosillo, the 19 year old U.S. citizen who was in prison [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=490.84000000000003s)]
*  for 10 days by U.S. immigration authorities. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=494.84000000000003s)]
*  It turns out he had a seizure and he went to the hospital [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=497.36s)]
*  and then he saw a border patrol agent and asked that guy for help. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=499.56s)]
*  And then they they threw him in jail. It's. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=502.48s)]
*  And then they then Trisha McLaughlin, the DHS spokesman, went online [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=505.52000000000004s)]
*  on Twitter and lied and made up this whole story about how we went up [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=510.16s)]
*  to a border patrol agent and claimed to be from Mexico [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=513.24s)]
*  and the country illegally. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=515.88s)]
*  And it's like this is just the pattern over and over and over again. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=516.76s)]
*  They do something horrible and they pretend something else happened. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=519.32s)]
*  So I feel like you have if you deported, even if the mother wanted the kid [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=522.0s)]
*  to come, if it's a four year old with cancer and you find that out [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=525.4s)]
*  and you're the government, wouldn't you do something? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=528.32s)]
*  Wouldn't you like make it so that the kid could get his [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=530.8000000000001s)]
*  the kid could get their medication or a doctor or something? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=533.64s)]
*  These people don't fucking give a shit. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=536.44s)]
*  On the Judge Dugan case, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=538.4s)]
*  it certainly seems like whether or not she broke the law, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=540.32s)]
*  there wasn't a legal or public safety rationale for frog [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=543.64s)]
*  marching her out of the courtroom and having the FBI director [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=548.0s)]
*  and the attorney general essentially celebrate the arrest in the media. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=551.16s)]
*  What did you think of the story? How alarming was it to you, love it? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=554.72s)]
*  You know, Donald Trump's been arrested [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=558.08s)]
*  and nobody showed up at his house and frog marched him out of the door [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=560.4s)]
*  because they understood that he's not a danger in that circumstance, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=563.44s)]
*  that there's no urgency to this, that you can show some respect [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=567.52s)]
*  and have this person report clearly. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=570.72s)]
*  This judge is going to fight these charges. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=573.1999999999999s)]
*  There was a the judge was angry that they were even trying to [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=575.12s)]
*  serve this arrest warrant. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=579.72s)]
*  The judge claiming it was a they had the wrong kind of warrant, right? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=580.88s)]
*  We're going to learn more about this. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=583.64s)]
*  Whatever the exact facts turn out to be, this will be a gray area, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=585.24s)]
*  even if it's the worst possible version of what fucking Cash Patel is saying, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=589.28s)]
*  it will be a gray area at best. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=592.84s)]
*  I can't trust these people or anything that they're saying about it. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=594.96s)]
*  Anyway, what is certainly clear is they are excited about the prospect [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=597.64s)]
*  of arresting a judge and sending a message to other judges about, hey, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=600.76s)]
*  if you're thinking about standing up for an immigrant that's in in your courtroom, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=604.76s)]
*  that's a dangerous thing to do. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=609.88s)]
*  You should be really careful about how you do that. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=610.8s)]
*  You should be worried that if you cross some invisible line [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=612.0799999999999s)]
*  that you won't know about till after till we tell you about it, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=614.6s)]
*  you might find yourself arrested in front of your courtroom. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=617.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Tom Homan threatened others today at that press conference at the White House. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=619.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's very clear that these guys, Homan, Stephen Miller, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=622.36s)]
*  all the hardline immigration folks, they want to fix fights with state [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=625.72s)]
*  and local officials so they can call them south of immigration [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=629.12s)]
*  or call them sanctuary cities or whatever. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=632.1600000000001s)]
*  And this does seem like it's a shocking escalation. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=633.6800000000001s)]
*  But also clearly there was a weird PR rollout that had been planned, right? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=635.64s)]
*  Because Cash Patel tweets about it. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=639.64s)]
*  He deletes it. Then Pam Bondi tweets about it. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=641.32s)]
*  And then they push this. They do this big PR push. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=644.2s)]
*  The story is very weird. The facts are weird. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=646.88s)]
*  Why would a judge help someone who was before her for battery charges [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=649.0400000000001s)]
*  get out of the courtroom? You're right. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=653.44s)]
*  There was no public safety problem because they the cops immediately [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=655.08s)]
*  arrest the guy the same day. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=658.2s)]
*  So it's not like he was on the lam. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=659.6800000000001s)]
*  And then they also arrested her at work when she arrived. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=661.24s)]
*  No, that's the problem. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=664.0400000000001s)]
*  Like, like, it was. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=665.32s)]
*  Yes. And the claim, right, that, oh, she secretly directed him out one door [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=667.0400000000001s)]
*  and then another. They got him right then. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=670.24s)]
*  Like it didn't lead to any actual negative consequences. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=672.0s)]
*  Clay Higgins, a House member from a Republican House member, said, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=674.5600000000001s)]
*  I hope they arrest 100 more judges. Cool. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=678.76s)]
*  So member of Congress. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=681.0400000000001s)]
*  No, I think I was looking into this because Andrew McCarthy, of all people, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=682.64s)]
*  it's like a very right wing conservative legal pundit. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=687.08s)]
*  He was writing in the National Review why it was very bad that they did this. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=691.24s)]
*  Basically. And he said, look, whether whether she was in [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=694.56s)]
*  do the right thing or not, whether she's guilty or not. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=697.88s)]
*  He's like the deal is in Milwaukee and Wisconsin and other places like this. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=699.88s)]
*  The state judge doesn't necessarily know the person's immigration status [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=705.12s)]
*  that comes to the courtroom for this other trial. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=708.28s)]
*  And the federal agents didn't tell the judge they were coming. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=711.24s)]
*  They didn't alert the police. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=715.36s)]
*  They could have alerted the chief judge ahead of time. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=716.68s)]
*  They needed to get this guy and like make arrangements. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=718.64s)]
*  So they could have again, if they wanted to get this guy, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=720.76s)]
*  you call up the local state authorities, be like, hey, there's this guy. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=723.12s)]
*  He's a danger. We're going to get, you know, didn't do any of that. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=725.72s)]
*  And state court judges don't necessarily like federal agents [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=728.56s)]
*  just jumping into their courtrooms and arresting people [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=733.8s)]
*  because you're trying these cases in state court. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=737.12s)]
*  And if people who are supposed to go into state court, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=740.1600000000001s)]
*  whether they're defendants, whether they're testifying, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=743.36s)]
*  if they know that like federal agents can come scoop them up at any time, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=745.5600000000001s)]
*  then they're not going to come testify for the other cases. Right. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=749.2800000000001s)]
*  So there's a reason not to do this. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=751.76s)]
*  And the idea that feds can just come in without a federal search warrant, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=753.6800000000001s)]
*  because they had an administrative warrant, which is what this is what [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=760.52s)]
*  the judge objected to. Right. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=762.6800000000001s)]
*  And this is what she was. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=763.48s)]
*  This is what she objected to. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=764.8000000000001s)]
*  And again, right, like they ended up getting the guy [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=765.96s)]
*  and they just they this happened, I guess, in the first Trump term as well. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=770.1600000000001s)]
*  There was a judge in Boston who told an undocumented immigrant [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=774.5600000000001s)]
*  to go down into the basement. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=779.12s)]
*  And the difference was they did not. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=780.2800000000001s)]
*  They let him come in on his own. The judge. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=783.5600000000001s)]
*  They did not arrest that judge. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=786.1600000000001s)]
*  Or they didn't. They let the judge come in on their own. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=787.6s)]
*  They didn't arrest them right there. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=789.48s)]
*  And the judges, the charges were eventually dropped. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=791.1600000000001s)]
*  And they had like the state disciplinary board deal with it. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=793.64s)]
*  It was like an ethics case. Yeah. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=798.12s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Yeah. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=799.76s)]
*  It's not like I think this judge is, I don't know, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=800.6s)]
*  it was a danger to the community. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=802.4s)]
*  Flight rate. The judge is out now. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=803.72s)]
*  Of course. It's ridiculous. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=805.16s)]
*  They love this. Yeah, they love this. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=806.24s)]
*  One other big story that Trump is probably less eager to discuss [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=809.4399999999999s)]
*  on immigration on Friday. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=812.48s)]
*  The administration abandoned its efforts to terminate the legal status [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=814.1999999999999s)]
*  of thousands of foreign students. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=817.16s)]
*  Tommy, what do we know about why they did this and what happens now? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=819.56s)]
*  I mean, it sounds like there are about 100 lawsuits [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=822.9599999999999s)]
*  and nearly two dozen court orders blocking them from deporting. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=824.76s)]
*  These people are getting the other country. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=828.4s)]
*  And it sounds like ICE was about to have to testify under oath [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=830.56s)]
*  about the process. So maybe that was a concern just on the merits. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=835.4399999999999s)]
*  If the administration cares about that, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=840.04s)]
*  this likely would precipitate a huge drop in foreign students, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=842.4399999999999s)]
*  which would impact not just school revenue, but the US's ability [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=845.56s)]
*  to get the smartest researchers and the engineers to come here [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=849.1999999999999s)]
*  and to learn and to conduct research and do things that are very beneficial [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=851.56s)]
*  to the country. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=855.48s)]
*  I'm not confident that the administration won't find some other way [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=857.56s)]
*  to punish foreign students. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=861.5999999999999s)]
*  It's not at all clear that this is going to help people like Mukmu Khalil, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=863.2399999999999s)]
*  who was arrested for peaceful protests over the war in Gaza. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=866.76s)]
*  By the way, speaking of cruelty, he was denied a request [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=870.2399999999999s)]
*  for a two week furlough with an ankle bracelet to be present [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=873.9599999999999s)]
*  at the birth of his first child. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=876.7199999999999s)]
*  I said no. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=878.64s)]
*  So but, you know, it does seem like there's reprieve here [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=879.8s)]
*  for a lot of other students. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=883.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, this reminds me, we talked about this early on and about [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=885.0s)]
*  what it looks like for the administration to follow court orders. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=888.28s)]
*  And I do think this is [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=891.96s)]
*  following court orders doesn't just mean [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=894.72s)]
*  what you do or don't do after the order has come through. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=897.44s)]
*  It's all the work that goes into treating the courts with respect and showing up. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=901.28s)]
*  And they're a little bit like Lucy with the chocolates right now. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=905.16s)]
*  They do a brazenly illegal move to hundreds, if not thousands of students. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=908.88s)]
*  Suddenly, there's 100 lawsuits. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=913.9599999999999s)]
*  Suddenly, there's all these people with very valid claims in front of very angry judges. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=915.52s)]
*  The Jenner block case is before a judge. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=919.3199999999999s)]
*  And the DOJ person is trying to defend this ridiculous order. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=923.5999999999999s)]
*  And actually, it's because of racial discrimination. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=927.12s)]
*  And the judge is like, what the fuck are you talking about? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=929.64s)]
*  It's embarrassing. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=931.52s)]
*  And so they're kind of brushing up. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=932.5999999999999s)]
*  It's like, look, I do not think they give a fuck about whether or not colleges [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=934.16s)]
*  recruit students from around the world. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=938.12s)]
*  I think they are thrilled to fuck with colleges [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=940.0799999999999s)]
*  and their ability to recruit foreign students. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=942.76s)]
*  But I do think they are brush hitting some kind of genuine, like human capacity [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=944.3199999999999s)]
*  limits to pursue all this brazen, illegal contact and conduct and then defend it in court. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=948.84s)]
*  Does Lucy have a move with chocolates, too? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=953.24s)]
*  Lucy. So there's Lucy with the football. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=955.6s)]
*  That's Charlie Brown. I'm talking about. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=957.56s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry. I love Lucy with the chocolates on the conveyor belt. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=958.96s)]
*  So they're doing illegal. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=963.52s)]
*  The chocolates are I think the chocolates are crimes of some kind. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=964.6s)]
*  You know, they're trying to do something with the construct. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=968.76s)]
*  Yes. No, I hear that. I hear that. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=972.64s)]
*  Lucy with the chocolates. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=974.36s)]
*  Lucy with the football. Sorry. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=975.48s)]
*  It seems like what happened here, there may have been AI involved, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=977.16s)]
*  which is there's this big database of all the students who have this specific kind of visa. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=980.36s)]
*  This is the F1 visa. Right. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=984.12s)]
*  And this is and so they were not going to deport them like they did. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=985.64s)]
*  Mahmood Khalil. Right. That was like the the secretary of state somehow. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=989.24s)]
*  Marco Rubio saying he's a threat to national security. Right. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=992.72s)]
*  Yeah. Somehow that that's something that the secretary of state can do. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=994.68s)]
*  This was so they all have their legal status in some database. Right. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=998.4399999999999s)]
*  And then they went through and anyone who's ever had the most minor brush [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1001.88s)]
*  with any with the law, they just terminated their status. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1006.2399999999999s)]
*  Traffic violations. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1009.52s)]
*  So one woman in Connecticut said she was targeted after a dispute over a luggage fee. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1010.4799999999999s)]
*  Once once acute once was accused, one was accused of boarding a bus that was out of service. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1015.8399999999999s)]
*  One was cited by police for driving too slowly. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1021.3599999999999s)]
*  So these are the kinds of things that we were. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1023.64s)]
*  And so then they'd go to court and the judge was like, OK, so and the DOJ would be like, well, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1025.6399999999999s)]
*  that doesn't necessarily mean they're going to get deported. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1031.0s)]
*  It's just that they're they can always challenge it. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1032.56s)]
*  And they're like, but what if they just get scooped up? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1034.6399999999999s)]
*  And they're like, well, their termination, their their status was terminated in the database. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1037.2s)]
*  But that doesn't necessarily. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1042.4s)]
*  And so one of the judges, an exasperated US district judge on a race, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1043.4s)]
*  this was in the Politico story about this, said, he's either here legally or he's not here legally. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1047.36s)]
*  There is a yes or no answer here. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1052.72s)]
*  This is not Schrodinger's visa. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1054.8s)]
*  Either he's here legally or he's not nice. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1056.84s)]
*  Like this in the end, I think this is one of the reasons they sort of backed off, because it was [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1059.68s)]
*  this is what I mean. It's cool. But it's just like incompetent. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1063.92s)]
*  They can't get in front there. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1065.96s)]
*  These guys have to go to in front of a judge and defend these indefensible decisions. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1066.96s)]
*  It reminds me a little makes me like I think the to Tommy's point, it reminds me of when they [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1070.8799999999999s)]
*  in the early days in 2017 did their Muslim ban. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1076.08s)]
*  It gets thrown out. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1079.96s)]
*  And then they go back and figure out a way to do it that can like pass muster with at least, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1081.12s)]
*  you know, conservative judges. Yeah. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1086.24s)]
*  And that that's what they're doing. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1088.2s)]
*  They're going to go back and try to figure out a way to do this. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1089.36s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's right. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1091.1999999999998s)]
*  But I also do think this is exactly what they did with the Venezuelans they sent to El Salvador, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1091.9599999999998s)]
*  which was they pulsed the ice database for anyone somehow connected to Trander, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1096.32s)]
*  Aragua and it found people who just had tattoos or like wore a bull's jersey. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1099.6s)]
*  And the problem there is the damage is done. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1104.1999999999998s)]
*  And these people are now rotting in hell in an El Salvador prison. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1105.8799999999999s)]
*  Or people that just happen to have been touching the immigration system at the moment [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1109.24s)]
*  where they were getting beat down by their boss to go find people. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1113.08s)]
*  Right. All right. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1116.04s)]
*  So here we are at 100 days, which is a completely made up milestone in every president's [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1117.76s)]
*  four year term that gives an administration the chance to talk about its accomplishments. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1122.44s)]
*  Media is a chance to do some retrospectives. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1126.2s)]
*  And if they're lucky, get an interview with the president. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1128.8s)]
*  Pollsters get a chance to put out a bunch of new polls. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1130.96s)]
*  Trump's doing a rally in Michigan on Tuesday night. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1133.96s)]
*  He'll also be sitting for an interview with ABC News. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1136.12s)]
*  He's already done big interviews with Time magazine, another with our friends, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1138.84s)]
*  Ashley Parker and Michael Sher at the Atlantic. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1142.76s)]
*  That one posted on Monday morning as we were getting ready for this recording. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1144.84s)]
*  You guys have moments from the time or Atlantic interviews you want to talk about [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1149.04s)]
*  that stood out to you as either newsy or at least noteworthy. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1152.4399999999998s)]
*  I mean, first of all, the time one, there's the one one thing that [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1156.7199999999998s)]
*  it's just it just sucks to sort of sink into a Trump interview [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1161.8799999999999s)]
*  because it's just sand through your through your hands. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1165.12s)]
*  But I did want to note that he basically says when he's talking about the law firms [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1167.04s)]
*  that the law firms going along with these deals and these are smart people. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1172.04s)]
*  They went along with these deals because they know they did something wrong. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1175.1599999999999s)]
*  And I just hope the people that made those deals feel pretty proud of themselves. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1177.6s)]
*  That now he's just basically saying, look, these guys are copping to it. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1180.24s)]
*  That's what happened here. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1182.68s)]
*  In the Atlantic one, he did something similar about with the with the media [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1183.76s)]
*  people like you saw about Bezos. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1188.1599999999999s)]
*  But with them, he was like, at some point, you just keep going. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1189.8799999999999s)]
*  You keep pushing, you keep pushing. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1191.8799999999999s)]
*  And then they say, no mass, no mass. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1192.96s)]
*  You know, the first kind of 100 days, a person who raised up 100 days [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1196.52s)]
*  is milestone. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1200.36s)]
*  You know, it's an FDR. FDR. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1201.28s)]
*  Yeah. Nice. Good. Good trivia. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1202.9599999999998s)]
*  Another another great president who served more than two terms. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1204.7199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, a couple from the Time magazine one, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1208.56s)]
*  when he's talked about the Supreme Court's ruling on a break of Garcia, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1211.08s)]
*  they read the language from the ruling. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1213.9199999999998s)]
*  It's like the order properly requires the government to facilitate a break. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1215.28s)]
*  A Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1218.32s)]
*  And they say, are you facilitating its release? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1220.84s)]
*  Trump ducks the question. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1222.84s)]
*  He's like, I leave that to my lawyers. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1224.04s)]
*  I give them no instructions. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1225.52s)]
*  You know, they feel the order says something different than what you're saying. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1227.1999999999998s)]
*  So it just it reminds you that if he's going to defy the Supreme Court, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1230.36s)]
*  it's not going to be openly, bravely. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1234.56s)]
*  It's going to be through bureaucratic bullshit like that and cowardice. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1237.36s)]
*  Also, that is going to he then says, yeah, I mean, I'm for bringing him back [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1240.6799999999998s)]
*  and and doing it here the right way, but I'll leave it to my lawyer. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1246.04s)]
*  So like even him acknowledging that he's willing to bring him back, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1249.28s)]
*  that is going to fuck him in these court hearings, because now [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1253.7199999999998s)]
*  the Supreme Court's to be like, all right, we said [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1256.8799999999999s)]
*  you must facilitate his release. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1258.72s)]
*  You must take steps to facilitate his release. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1260.48s)]
*  And then the president just told a reporter that he's fine with that. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1262.44s)]
*  But you jokers are refusing to do that. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1266.6000000000001s)]
*  It's our general. Yeah. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1269.52s)]
*  That's not going to work so well in court. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1270.3600000000001s)]
*  I don't think. Yeah. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1271.64s)]
*  That to me was one of the big takeaways from the two from the two. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1272.8s)]
*  I agree. No, I agree. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1275.1200000000001s)]
*  And there was something strange about that, right? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1276.24s)]
*  Because the court has already ordered him to do it whether he wants to do it or not. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1277.72s)]
*  So it's almost like it's almost beside the point whether he wants to do it [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1281.04s)]
*  or not, unless he's trying to push it onto his underlings for failing to do it, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1284.28s)]
*  which, of course, is something he'll he'll be interested in doing. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1287.72s)]
*  He's leaving the PAM, as Steve Miller said. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1290.1200000000001s)]
*  He also promises to veto any cuts, any bill that cuts social security, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1292.24s)]
*  Medicare and Medicaid to file that one away. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1295.52s)]
*  Except fraud and abuse. Everything's going to be right. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1298.1200000000001s)]
*  Everything's fraud and abuse. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1299.76s)]
*  He's asked about promising to end the war in Ukraine on day one. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1300.64s)]
*  And Trump now says he meant it, quote, figuratively as an exaggeration and ingest. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1303.44s)]
*  So your classic joke about a war that you are also saying [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1307.64s)]
*  is going to lead to World War Three. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1310.8s)]
*  And then when the interviewer suggests he was kidding about annexing Canada [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1312.96s)]
*  and just trolling them, he says, actually, no, I'm not repeatedly. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1315.92s)]
*  The other thing I took from the Atlantic piece is [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1319.6000000000001s)]
*  he is not backing down on the tariffs in this trade war [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1322.72s)]
*  because Cher at one point asks him, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1325.4s)]
*  you know, folks on Wall Street are calling calling it the Trump put. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1329.24s)]
*  And they're saying that if things get bad enough and the market gets bad [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1333.1200000000001s)]
*  off the economy, it looks like it's going to a recession that you will pull back [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1335.72s)]
*  on the tariffs because you don't want the economy to go into recession. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1339.28s)]
*  Is there any truth to that? And Trump's like, no, no. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1342.52s)]
*  He's like, look, I've been talking about this stuff for 30, 40 years. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1344.92s)]
*  And this could have been I could have been easy. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1347.4s)]
*  I could have came in here. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1349.68s)]
*  I could have not done the tariff stuff and just had everything be fine. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1350.4s)]
*  But I think this is important to do. And so I'm doing it. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1353.16s)]
*  Yeah. It's so hard to figure out what's going on with their [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1355.8s)]
*  because they don't have a long term plan, like what their long term plan is on [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1360.0s)]
*  tariffs. If he is ever going to relieve them, he can't say that he's going going [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1362.4s)]
*  to do it. He's also making ridiculous claims about how much tax revenue [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1366.56s)]
*  will come from these tariffs and claiming it's going to be able to reduce income [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1370.28s)]
*  taxes or get rid of the income tax, which is absurd on its face. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1373.8s)]
*  And it can't do both. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1377.1599999999999s)]
*  It can't restore American manufacturing and replace income taxes because they're [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1378.76s)]
*  in cross purposes. So I just think he's just full of shit. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1382.32s)]
*  I think he's full of shit. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1384.9199999999998s)]
*  I think what will happen is they'll try to negotiate some sort of memorandum [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1385.72s)]
*  of understanding with the non-China countries that suggest there's a trade [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1389.04s)]
*  agreement. It won't be a real trade agreement because real trade agreements [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1393.52s)]
*  involve caring about the details. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1396.28s)]
*  And those take years. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1397.84s)]
*  And they'll come muddle through that way. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1399.08s)]
*  The big question to me is what happens with the China piece of this? [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1400.52s)]
*  Because Xi Jinping backing down. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1402.68s)]
*  If Trump doesn't want to back down, it's going to cause some serious problems [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1404.96s)]
*  in the long run. Yeah, this is my issue with this is that like I'm sure Besant [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1408.2s)]
*  is and the people who don't want a global economic meltdown are pushing this [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1412.72s)]
*  like we're going to get some, you know, parameters of a deal and then he'll back [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1417.44s)]
*  off. So fine. He backs up the reciprocal tariffs like the China. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1421.48s)]
*  The China piece is still there. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1424.8400000000001s)]
*  We still have a 10 percent universal tariff for everywhere else, even without [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1425.96s)]
*  the reciprocal tariffs. You still have the 25 percent on Canada and Mexico. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1429.92s)]
*  And so and we still haven't we're still a couple of weeks out from really [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1433.4s)]
*  experiencing like the full effects or at least the start to experiencing [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1437.96s)]
*  the effects of the trade war, like empty shelves and higher prices. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1442.88s)]

*  I got to say, I think you got two very stubborn authoritarians [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1502.24s)]
*  sitting there and the one thing I got from the full Atlantic interview, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1507.64s)]
*  this guy does just he does not give a shit. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1511.64s)]
*  He really is at a point in his life where he's like, everything's fine. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1513.8s)]
*  You know, I came back from he thinks that he came back from the dead. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1516.52s)]
*  Or though he doesn't like to call it a comeback, he said, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1521.52s)]
*  because he thinks he was never really gone. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1523.16s)]
*  But he basically thinks he has defied political gravity. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1526.08s)]
*  And what's worse, the people around him are all people who believe he has [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1529.04s)]
*  he has chosen by God and has defied political gravity. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1533.48s)]
*  Well, it was. And right, of course. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1536.32s)]
*  And so none of them are going to pull him back either, except poor Scott Besson, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1537.92s)]
*  who's like, who's like, hoping that we don't have a global economic collapse. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1541.32s)]
*  So I really do think, look, he's Donald Trump at some point. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1544.48s)]
*  He pulls back how much damage there is, who knows. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1547.68s)]
*  But I think in general, whether it's tariffs or anything else, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1549.92s)]
*  he is going to go much further than he ever has in the past [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1552.8799999999999s)]
*  because he does not care as much about public opinion as he ever did. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1557.28s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, I think that's first of all, I think that's already true. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1562.36s)]
*  He's already gone further than he did in his first term. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1565.04s)]
*  Now, I have no idea whether or not Donald Trump will cave. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1567.12s)]
*  I just think [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1569.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't think he'll show the same patience as the nation of China. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1571.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think the Chinese, you know, Xi Jinping has prepared his people for a war [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1575.3600000000001s)]
*  and the American people are not at all prepared for what a war with China [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1581.44s)]
*  could look like, what it means. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1585.16s)]
*  If we have zero rare earth minerals, it means we can't produce cars anymore. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1586.56s)]

*  Trump's numbers with young people, independents and Hispanics, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1839.5600000000002s)]

*  And most of the slide has to do with people's feelings about the economy [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1846.92s)]
*  in their own personal finances, which are bad. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1849.44s)]

*  There's one number from the Harvard poll that jumped out, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1854.68s)]
*  which is 59 percent of young men now disapprove of Trump. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1857.16s)]
*  So he's lost the boys. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1860.72s)]
*  Tough. The vibe shifts has shifted back. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1861.76s)]
*  Let's hope it's abysmal. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1865.0s)]
*  The numbers are abysmal. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1866.28s)]
*  I mean, ABC News had the lowest one hundred day approval rating of any president [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1867.0400000000002s)]
*  in the past 80 years. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1870.1200000000001s)]
*  And the second lowest was him last time. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1871.44s)]
*  And it's funny just because the narrative around his presidency in 2017 [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1873.4s)]
*  was that it felt very weak and unsteady because he shouldn't have been elected. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1877.72s)]
*  And it was a shock to everybody. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1881.24s)]
*  And they were just getting up to speed. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1882.44s)]
*  And the narrative after this election was how much stronger he was politically, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1883.72s)]
*  how much more overwhelming the victory was. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1887.04s)]
*  And now he's in worse shape. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1889.3999999999999s)]
*  It's that away. Yeah. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1890.8799999999999s)]
*  So it's just good to remember this guy's not 10 feet tall. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1891.92s)]
*  He never. And he also, by the way, in the first term, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1894.36s)]
*  he never really recovered from the hundred day mark. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1896.48s)]
*  Like it only got I mean, it was in a narrow band from like, you know, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1898.96s)]
*  thirty nine to forty three, forty four. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1901.96s)]
*  And then he lost. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1903.84s)]
*  Not by much, but he lost. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1906.3999999999999s)]
*  I think it's also interesting. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1908.68s)]
*  Most people, including those who voted for him, think he's gone too far. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1911.24s)]
*  That's like the theme of the New York Times, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1915.2s)]
*  CNN poll is that even even people who, you know, there's still like a slight [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1916.56s)]
*  majority support for deporting undocumented immigrants, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1920.2s)]
*  but they just don't like the way he's doing it because of a break with Garcia, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1923.0s)]
*  because of other things they've heard, because of defying court orders. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1925.88s)]
*  I also thought it was one of the more hopeful parts of the New York Times. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1929.2s)]
*  CNN poll was they asked about support for deporting citizens to El Salvador, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1932.8s)]
*  U.S. citizens who were convicted of crimes to El Salvador. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1937.72s)]
*  And they asked about whether you support him defying the Supreme Court. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1940.44s)]
*  And Nate Cohen was saying he had almost zero percent [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1944.6000000000001s)]
*  on those Supreme Court defying the Supreme Court. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1949.3600000000001s)]
*  Six percent would approve of that six. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1952.0400000000002s)]
*  You don't get you don't get that for anything anymore. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1955.24s)]
*  No, that's that's that is hardening. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1957.16s)]
*  That is hardening. And it is the [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1958.92s)]
*  I mean, you see them. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1961.52s)]
*  This is why I think if the public opinion matters, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1962.16s)]
*  you see them backing off in certain places. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1965.44s)]
*  And that is because I think courts will be more confident [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1967.76s)]
*  when they feel like public support is behind them. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1971.0800000000002s)]
*  And Trump will be more [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1972.8s)]
*  weak and afraid of the consequences of violating court orders [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1974.4s)]
*  when the public are so thoroughly behind the courts. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1977.64s)]
*  I do like it is interesting thinking about 2017 versus now, because [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1981.8799999999999s)]
*  chaos was the the the kind of order of the day when Trump first won. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1987.28s)]
*  And he was at his lowest ebb when he was actually almost [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1991.76s)]
*  it didn't come through because of John McCain, but he was on the precipice [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1995.4s)]
*  of of repealing Obamacare. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1997.92s)]
*  And it was a moment where he was about to be effective. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=1999.72s)]
*  And when he was about to be effective, he was never more unpopular. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2001.4s)]
*  And I do think like the early days we were, I think, caught off guard [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2004.52s)]
*  by the swiftness and like not I would have been more effective is wrong. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2007.8400000000001s)]
*  But like the speed and deliberateness with which they were like [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2011.72s)]
*  attacking the government, going after immigrants, kind of implementing [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2014.8400000000001s)]
*  the 2025 part of 2025 agenda. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2017.6000000000001s)]
*  But he's actually paying for that success. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2020.2s)]
*  He's paying for the lack because chaos stopped him from doing the policies [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2022.24s)]
*  that we are currently seeing that the American people, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2026.1200000000001s)]
*  even though it's very clear that this is what Trump has always said [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2028.6000000000001s)]
*  he was going to do, were not fully couldn't fully imagine [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2031.32s)]
*  what it would feel like to live under. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2034.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2035.36s)]
*  And also think, you know, deciding to tank the stock market, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2036.08s)]
*  not a great political strategy. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2039.0s)]
*  I mean, I think 73 percent said the economy is in bad shape. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2040.24s)]
*  Fifty three percent said it's worse since Trump took office. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2043.2s)]
*  Forty one percent said their own finances have worsened. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2046.2s)]
*  Sixty two percent said prices are rising. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2048.68s)]
*  So they're doing a ton of shit to dozing. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2050.7999999999997s)]
*  They're harming migrants, et cetera. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2053.2s)]
*  But they're doing nothing to deal with inflation. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2055.2799999999997s)]
*  And the tariffs are just actively causing inflation. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2057.04s)]
*  And no one, only 31 percent, believe that they'll strengthen the economy [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2060.56s)]
*  long term, like 64 percent of people disapprove of the tariffs. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2063.6800000000003s)]
*  So they're not the American people are not buying what he's selling [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2066.28s)]
*  on the on the theory of the case here. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2069.6s)]
*  Yeah. And he did act fast and he did do a lot. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2071.92s)]
*  But the Times asked people for like a word to describe the first 100 days. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2076.28s)]
*  And chaos was still the order of the day. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2081.6s)]
*  It's his essence. It is his essence. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2084.76s)]
*  Question on the polling. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2088.0s)]
*  The guy can't run for reelection despite selling Trump 2028 merch on his website. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2089.32s)]
*  How much do you think the polling matters? [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2094.48s)]
*  I talked to Ro Khanna on Love or Leave It about what the prospects are [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2095.96s)]
*  for reconciliation, and he basically said he never had felt more confident or hopeful. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2100.32s)]
*  I don't think he would say he's confident, but more confident [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2104.88s)]
*  that they'd be able to [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2107.2400000000002s)]
*  get enough Republicans to say no, at least before they strip out certain parts. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2109.32s)]
*  Who knows where it leads? [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2112.6800000000003s)]
*  But I do think it matters because [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2114.52s)]
*  he has a razor thin majority and there are a lot of Republicans [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2118.1600000000003s)]
*  who would like to stay in Congress. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2121.0400000000004s)]
*  And there are a lot of them in districts that right now they are [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2122.52s)]
*  going to have a very hard time [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2126.2000000000003s)]
*  successfully getting reelected in. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2129.28s)]
*  And I just think that is going to affect their ability to pass this agenda. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2130.8s)]
*  He he was much stronger a couple of weeks ago. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2134.6400000000003s)]
*  He was much. And that's why you saw today he posted on True Social, like [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2137.4s)]
*  they should arrest the people disturbing these town halls [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2140.7200000000003s)]
*  because it's creating the illusion that there isn't incredible unity [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2143.0s)]
*  and love amongst Republicans. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2145.84s)]
*  And I think he's feeling the heat there. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2148.1200000000003s)]
*  And I think it's making his job much harder. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2150.32s)]
*  Yeah, we want the vulnerable Republicans to feel like they can defy him. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2152.04s)]
*  And when they're doing some calculus, like, am I worried [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2155.88s)]
*  about a primary challenge or a general election? [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2158.44s)]
*  We want them to fear the general election more. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2160.6800000000003s)]
*  Now, the problem is, you know, he sells the North Korean numbers [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2163.04s)]
*  with the Republican base, so he can fuck with them in the primary. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2165.76s)]
*  The the timeline isn't good for him either. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2170.1200000000003s)]
*  And I think Thune said today that he doesn't think this thing is getting done [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2172.4s)]
*  till like later in the summer. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2177.32s)]
*  And so and also, but he said it's like a moving target [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2179.96s)]
*  because of when the debt ceiling, when we hit the debt ceiling, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2183.96s)]
*  when we run out of money, just in case we did another crisis. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2187.04s)]
*  So as the trade is, the effects from the trade war start to hit [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2190.96s)]
*  and the economy gets even worse and people get even angrier, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2195.04s)]
*  then we're going to have a debate in Congress about how big a tax cut is. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2198.8s)]
*  They go mostly to rich people. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2202.76s)]
*  Cutting Medicare and cutting Medicare and cutting Medicaid. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2204.76s)]
*  And they've already now ruled out a tax increase on the rich, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2207.2400000000002s)]
*  you know, which like Steve Bannon wanted and Trump is voting [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2214.0s)]
*  and some of these some of the populists wanted. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2216.76s)]
*  There's like a there's like a 40 hour window. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2218.84s)]
*  Yeah. When I was on the table. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2220.92s)]
*  So that's not on the table. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2222.0s)]
*  So now and they also have to do something on taxes, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2222.88s)]
*  because otherwise everyone taxes goes up at the end of the year, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2226.4s)]
*  at which time we'll probably already be in a we could be in a recession. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2228.96s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2231.88s)]
*  And by the way, I don't know how this goes. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2232.88s)]
*  The other side of this is there are a bunch of Republicans [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2235.88s)]
*  that just signed a letter about not wanting to cut Medicaid. Right. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2237.6400000000003s)]
*  And so let's say they strip it. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2240.12s)]
*  I don't think it's inconceivable that they strip out the Medicaid cuts [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2241.52s)]
*  and just try to do a tax cut there. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2243.84s)]
*  But one of the only places where even Freedom Caucus members [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2245.6800000000003s)]
*  have bucked Trump is when it came to raising the deficit. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2248.2400000000002s)]
*  They sincerely believe and they believe they care about it [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2250.8s)]
*  as much as they care about pleasing Donald Trump. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2253.6s)]
*  It's one of the only issues and the only group of people that do this [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2255.2400000000002s)]
*  in the Republican Party that they don't want to vote for increased deficits. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2257.6s)]
*  If you lose those guys, you don't have a bill. You don't have it. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2260.36s)]
*  So I think it I think it fucks up his congressional agenda [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2263.7200000000003s)]
*  and it makes life pretty the polling makes like pretty bad for Republicans. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2266.76s)]
*  I also hope that this kind of polling [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2270.36s)]
*  emboldens more people to speak out against him. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2273.76s)]
*  Colleges, media business. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2277.56s)]
*  Like I just whatever you thought about Trump at the beginning, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2280.6800000000003s)]
*  how strong he was, how scary this was. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2283.48s)]
*  Like it's just he's not there now and you should not feel that same fear. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2285.28s)]
*  I also wonder if like I know courts are just they're just calling balls and strikes. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2289.7599999999998s)]
*  Judges are just calling balls and strikes. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2293.7599999999998s)]
*  But you've got to imagine if you're in the Supreme Court [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2295.56s)]
*  or some of these courts and you're thinking what the administration is doing [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2298.2799999999997s)]
*  is unlawful or unconstitutional and it comes before you. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2302.12s)]
*  You're a little less nervous about doing about making the ruling [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2305.12s)]
*  you want to make when the numbers are like this. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2308.24s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2310.24s)]
*  So that's how regular Americans say they're feeling. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2313.44s)]
*  How are you guys feeling being irregular Americans? [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2316.7999999999997s)]
*  But I honestly have never been less regular, frankly, under the Trump administration. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2319.84s)]
*  Also, just a couple of days on the road. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2325.84s)]
*  I know. I know. Time zone changes. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2328.7999999999997s)]
*  I wish I was a regular American. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2332.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm going to go see the doctor. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2333.92s)]
*  I've got to figure out a new kind of smoothie in the morning. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2334.6s)]
*  Join my fellow regular Americans. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2337.7599999999998s)]
*  We're sitting in the airport waiting to go home. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2340.16s)]
*  Love it. And I already take out just a just a bottle of those fiber gummies. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2342.44s)]
*  You bet. You fucking bet. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2346.4s)]
*  And I started laughing, but then I said, yeah, I'll take a couple. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2347.88s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I'll take a Tommy to one one. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2350.2400000000002s)]
*  Tommy, Tommy, Tommy's too cool for the fiber government. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2352.28s)]
*  That's the at the Delta lounge. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2355.6000000000004s)]
*  I was just trying to make it through a hangover at 44. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2356.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't think fiber hurts fiber hurts anyway. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2359.6400000000003s)]
*  What are your takes on how consequential these 14 weeks have been? [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2362.52s)]
*  I was the question I wrote down here. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2365.92s)]
*  It's been consequential. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2367.4s)]
*  I mean, it's been historically damaging. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2368.6400000000003s)]
*  100 days has no way to sugarcoat it. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2370.52s)]
*  Millions of people are going to die because the USAID cuts. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2372.48s)]
*  God knows what RFK Junior is doing behind the scenes, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2375.0s)]
*  but the stuff he's talking about publicly, we have an attempt to talk about him. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2377.92s)]
*  We got to devote a whole segment to that. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2380.36s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, he's just going to gut public health. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2381.68s)]
*  He's going to cherry pick data. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2383.3199999999997s)]
*  He's, you know, demagoguing anybody with autism. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2384.52s)]
*  I mean, it's just really terrible stuff. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2388.4s)]
*  You get corporations folding left and right. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2390.2s)]
*  We're seeing the weaponization of the Department of Justice to punish law firms. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2391.92s)]
*  News outlets, former Trump officials. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2395.64s)]
*  I'm I'm I'm also worried that the tariff war has set in motion [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2398.96s)]
*  some economic changes that will be impossible to walk back and will be very damaging. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2402.64s)]
*  But so I'm like on some level, it's heartening to know that the polling has [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2406.4s)]
*  collapsed, at least for this amount of time, because voters don't want chaos. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2411.2799999999997s)]
*  They don't want the stock market crashing. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2416.44s)]
*  They don't they don't like the deportations, despite everyone's concern [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2418.16s)]
*  that Democrats were off sides on immigration. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2421.4s)]
*  They actually think these deportations are cruel and over the top. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2423.7599999999998s)]
*  But I'm also worried that it's not going to stop him. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2427.52s)]
*  That I had the exact feeling, which is like, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2430.44s)]
*  I think that the polling is going to get worse for Trump and Republicans. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2433.08s)]
*  And I think the damage is going to get worse. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2436.6s)]
*  And because I think that they're not backing that, like [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2438.72s)]
*  there's one scenario where the polling gets really bad and they all back down [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2442.56s)]
*  or they just then I guess what we have like a semi normal administration [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2446.2799999999997s)]
*  for the next couple of years, where they just like that doesn't seem like Trump to me. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2450.68s)]
*  So then the other thing they do if the polling gets worse is [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2455.64s)]
*  they double down like they've been doing so far or they never show weakness, [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2459.7599999999998s)]
*  never apologize. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2463.7999999999997s)]
*  And then we're in a situation where the country is very angry [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2465.3599999999997s)]
*  and the economy is bad and we have crises that we're dealing with here [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2468.8399999999997s)]
*  and all over the world. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2472.96s)]
*  And then the Trump administration decides to like use all the power [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2474.2799999999997s)]
*  they have to crack down even more. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2477.96s)]
*  So that's what I'm sort of worried about. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2479.68s)]
*  Yeah, I I think like you have to start to say [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2481.9199999999996s)]
*  he is doing a lot of damage. He is hurting a lot of people. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2485.8799999999997s)]
*  There are people that will die that would have lived. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2487.84s)]
*  I mean, he is and that destruction can't be undone. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2489.76s)]
*  There's no pretending it didn't happen. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2492.88s)]
*  We'll be digging out of this for a long time. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2494.56s)]
*  Internationally, we will be digging out of this for a long time, though, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2496.32s)]
*  like I want to believe in like the resilience of the American economy [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2499.28s)]
*  and the unique place we have as an innovative and kind of [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2503.6400000000003s)]
*  creative country that contributes so much to the world that we can repair the damage. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2510.36s)]
*  But to me, like the core question from the day Trump won [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2514.2400000000002s)]
*  is is Donald Trump's second victory a door that locked behind us? [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2517.8s)]
*  Right. Like the damage can't be undone, but we can kind of rebuild and repair [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2523.04s)]
*  if we can win. Right. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2527.44s)]
*  We can take back the House, take back the Senate, take back the White House. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2528.44s)]
*  I do worry about what happens if the economy gets worse. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2531.48s)]
*  The chaos gets worse. That's a tinderbox. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2534.04s)]
*  It's people in the streets and an authoritarian president that is [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2536.0800000000004s)]
*  who's already unhappy with people at town halls. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2539.6000000000004s)]
*  Already unhappy with town halls. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2541.84s)]
*  You had you had Stephen Miller out there today criticizing J.B. Pritzker, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2543.2000000000003s)]
*  suggesting that what he's doing is inciting violence just for calling for protest. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2547.12s)]
*  Right. Like it is dangerous. These are people that are they are [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2550.24s)]
*  they are instinctively fascist. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2553.52s)]
*  They are instinctively authoritarian. That is incredibly dangerous. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2555.56s)]
*  But but one one sign of to me of at least hope is just [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2560.08s)]
*  I think even the past couple of weeks, we've seen Democrats starting to get [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2564.52s)]
*  their legs under them a little bit in a lot of interesting ways. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2567.12s)]
*  You talk about Pete, you could talk about Pritzker, talk about Ro Khanna, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2570.0s)]
*  talk about a bunch of people. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2573.3599999999997s)]
*  Cory Booker, others. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2574.8399999999997s)]
*  And I did have this feeling in the first [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2577.96s)]
*  like few weeks of the Trump administration of a kind of like [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2580.7999999999997s)]
*  like defeatism, like, oh, he's turning us into Hungary. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2584.44s)]
*  He's turning us into to Russia. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2586.92s)]
*  And I really was like looking for more leaders to say. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2588.52s)]
*  But but don't like we'll have to fight that and we'll win because [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2592.16s)]
*  America's filled with Americans. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2595.96s)]
*  And we're a rebellious and freedom loving and democracy loving bunch. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2597.52s)]
*  And maybe we're a little bit we're a little soft and a little decadent. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2601.24s)]
*  But like we'll find our footing and we'll fight back and we'll win. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2604.72s)]
*  And he can't take this country from us. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2606.88s)]
*  And I feel like that energy is starting to appear more and more. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2608.6400000000003s)]
*  You see it at protests. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2611.4s)]
*  You see the people showing up at rallies and town halls. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2612.1600000000003s)]
*  And so that has made me feel like the question like is the door [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2614.88s)]
*  did the door lock behind us? [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2618.7200000000003s)]
*  And I think the answer is still no. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2620.12s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's right. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2621.6400000000003s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2623.4s)]
*  I think it's just going to be a question of like, you know, as [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2624.2000000000003s)]
*  as they crack down more, as things get worse for them, [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2627.8s)]
*  are enough people going to be paying attention and speaking out and unafraid. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2632.32s)]
*  And I agree. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2636.7200000000003s)]
*  I think the signs have been somewhat hopeful in the last couple of weeks. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2638.7200000000003s)]
*  I've been more hopeful than I was in maybe the couple of months before that. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2641.44s)]
*  So let's talk about fighting back and sort of the general state [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2645.0800000000004s)]
*  of the opposition at 100 days. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2647.28s)]
*  We do have some reassuring updates about what Democrats, media outlets, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2648.84s)]
*  universities and law firms are doing to fight back against Trump. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2652.1200000000003s)]
*  To start with the politicians on Sunday, Senator Cory Booker [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2655.8s)]
*  and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries held a 12 hour sit-in [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2658.8s)]
*  on the Capitol steps to protest the Republican budget. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2661.84s)]
*  Meanwhile, Illinois Governor J.V. Pritzker, a 2028 presidential hopeful, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2664.72s)]
*  gave a barn burner of a speech in New Hampshire. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2668.84s)]
*  Why New Hampshire? I wonder. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2671.72s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2673.76s)]
*  Fellow Democrats, for far too long, we've been guilty of listening [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2674.76s)]
*  to a bunch of do nothing political types who would tell you [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2678.68s)]
*  that America's house is not on fire, even as the flames were licking their faces. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2682.92s)]
*  Time to stop wondering if you can trust the nuclear codes to people [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2688.2s)]
*  who don't know how to organize a group chat. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2691.92s)]
*  It's time to stop ignoring the hypocrisy and wearing a big gold cross [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2694.8s)]
*  while announcing the defunding of children's cancer research. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2699.2000000000003s)]
*  Never before in my life have I called for mass protests, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2703.2000000000003s)]
*  for mobilization, for disruption. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2707.2000000000003s)]
*  But I am now. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2710.12s)]
*  These Republicans cannot know a moment of peace. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2711.6s)]
*  They have to understand that we will fight their cruelty [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2716.4s)]
*  with every megaphone and microphone that we have. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2719.52s)]
*  We must castigate them on the soapbox and then punish them at the ballot box. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2722.32s)]
*  OK, side note, if you guys listening out there want to heed Pritzker's [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2728.96s)]
*  call to mobilize, you can find events and actions near you by visiting [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2732.92s)]
*  SaveAmerica.com and they're all peaceful protests. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2736.16s)]
*  No inciting violence like Stephen Miller. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2739.12s)]
*  Claim today. Yeah. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2741.64s)]
*  What do you guys think of Pritzker's message? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2743.08s)]
*  I really like the speech. I really did. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2745.08s)]
*  You know, the part you played, I know, I'm sure you're [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2747.12s)]
*  ears had a little bit of a little sing songy. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2749.36s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure a little bit. But I thought it was great. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2751.44s)]
*  I actually really liked a lot of it. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2753.92s)]
*  One part one section that I thought is worth looking at is the way he handled [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2755.2000000000003s)]
*  immigration because he was so strong on due process, on inhumanity [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2758.52s)]
*  of some of these deportations while talking about what we actually need to be for. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2763.0s)]
*  On a kind of unabashedly. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2767.48s)]
*  There was a lot of places in there where I thought like the the rhetoric [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2769.08s)]
*  wasn't as sanded down as you would hear from Democrats in the past. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2772.7200000000003s)]
*  And there was a moment where he talked about [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2776.96s)]
*  deference to I'm going to paraphrase it, but basically talking about [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2780.48s)]
*  one reason Democrats lost is not because Democrats don't have the right values, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2783.0s)]
*  but because the American people just don't see Democrats as the kind of people [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2786.7200000000003s)]
*  that will fight for them. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2790.2s)]
*  And I really liked it. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2791.2s)]
*  And it was a turn into this section that you played. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2792.04s)]
*  And on the whole, I just I hadn't seen him give a speech like that before. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2794.8s)]
*  And to me, like the two best speeches I've heard lately was this speech [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2798.84s)]
*  and the speech Rokana gave at Yale, which is a much more kind of [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2802.08s)]
*  cerebral and academic and philosophical speech. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2805.4s)]
*  But but putting them putting them side by side, I thought like, oh, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2808.16s)]
*  like there's an interesting kind of broad message there that I that I really like. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2810.72s)]
*  What do you think, Tommy? [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2814.7999999999997s)]
*  Did you feel like a lot of this was a pretty not that thinly veiled shot [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2815.8399999999997s)]
*  of Chuck Schumer? Oh, I was picking. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2819.88s)]
*  He kept talking about Democrats who hoped that one day Republicans [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2822.96s)]
*  would come to their senses, which Schumer famously talked about [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2827.16s)]
*  in that New York Times interview around [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2830.84s)]
*  the cave, the budget cave. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2834.2000000000003s)]
*  I thought Newsome, Newsome. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2835.84s)]
*  I thought Whitmer. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2837.88s)]
*  I thought and then I thought it was a general like, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2839.76s)]
*  you know, Obama Biden years, the fever is going to break kind of thing. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2844.52s)]
*  Like it was a like a sort of, yeah, vague shot at all that. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2848.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, we're shadow boxing a lot of straw men. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2852.6800000000003s)]
*  There was that, you know. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2854.36s)]
*  You know, it's funny. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2856.52s)]
*  I'm doing what I told myself I didn't want to do, which is like [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2857.32s)]
*  I watched the speech and I'm like, I could pick apart [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2860.16s)]
*  a lot of different parts of the speech. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2862.28s)]
*  And some of it is like as a speechwriter, some of it is like, [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2863.8s)]
*  what do you actually mean by that? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2866.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, I know. I know. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2867.52s)]
*  Strongman thing. And then some of it was, you know, for a for a speech [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2868.88s)]
*  where you're supposed to be like, we just got to say what we believe. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2873.48s)]
*  It does feel like a lot of rhetorical lines there. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2876.16s)]
*  You know, you you do to get applause. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2879.08s)]
*  But overall, I'm like, good for him for fucking getting out there [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2881.44s)]
*  and saying something. Yeah, I want to be I actually liked it. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2883.88s)]
*  I mean, like I watched all 30 minute long speech and it made me feel good. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2886.04s)]
*  And I was like, oh, this guy's a fighter and he's not pulling punches. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2889.2s)]
*  He's calling R.F.K. Junior, Nepo Baby and Pete Hegseth, [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2891.8399999999997s)]
*  a washed up Fox TV commentator who drank too much and committed sexual assault. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2895.7999999999997s)]
*  Like this was red meat. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2899.2s)]
*  A weird, weird Nepo baby that threw the the bear in his trunk. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2901.0s)]
*  Yeah, these were like fun lines designed to rev up a crowd. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2904.9199999999996s)]
*  It's a great speech to, you know, hit the primary trail. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2909.3199999999997s)]
*  I thought he did well and I thought it was called arms. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2912.6s)]
*  I like when he said as a Jew, like, stop tearing down the Constitution, [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2914.96s)]
*  the name of my ancestors. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2917.8s)]
*  Yes, I like that, too, because when the pendulum swings back, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2919.0s)]
*  you'll contribute to the climate of retribution, I think was the line. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2922.92s)]
*  So I thought there's a lot of interesting points he made. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2926.5600000000004s)]
*  The language was was tough, but quotable and made news. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2929.6000000000004s)]
*  And I liked it. Yeah, that was my only it's funny that you brought it [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2934.04s)]
*  because I actually thought it was directed more at Newsome. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2936.92s)]
*  I didn't think of Schumer. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2938.88s)]
*  And then I like sense that when I was getting to the to the [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2939.92s)]
*  when he was talking about the Democrats, he was critiquing. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2944.04s)]
*  I was like, I was like, well, these are applause lines [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2946.16s)]
*  about a kind of Democrat anybody would hate. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2948.72s)]
*  But like, who who do you mean? [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2951.3199999999997s)]
*  And what does it what does it look like to do something different? [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2952.48s)]
*  But I think that's what the next few months are about. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2954.8399999999997s)]
*  It also made me think of like, you know, [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2957.0s)]
*  get to that point, a primary debate stage. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2960.44s)]
*  And he's going to be the one that makes a lot of the other Democrats [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2962.7599999999998s)]
*  on that stage feel uncomfortable because he's not going to let them [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2965.64s)]
*  get away with, you know, not going hard. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2968.68s)]
*  Yeah. At Trump and Republicans. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2971.64s)]
*  And I think you need that kind of person in a primary for sure. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2974.6s)]
*  And we certainly need that kind of leader right now, [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2978.04s)]
*  just who's going to call out the bullshit. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2980.28s)]
*  It's interesting. Like we, you know, we were talking over the weekend about Pete's [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2982.6s)]
*  three and a half hour conversation on the flagrant podcast with Andrew Schultz. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2986.8s)]
*  And it's just such a different style. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2990.28s)]
*  And but like Pete did a really great job [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2992.44s)]
*  in that interview. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2996.12s)]
*  Totally different than Pritzker, totally different than, [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2997.0s)]
*  you know, a lot of these other candidates that we talked about. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=2999.6800000000003s)]
*  So I kind of like seeing everyone out there doing doing something different. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3001.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. And speaking of just like what has made the last [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3004.8399999999997s)]
*  even as things have been so terrible, like what has made me feel [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3009.0s)]
*  at least some glimmer of hope it is, you know, people have asked, [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3011.9599999999996s)]
*  well, who do you think the next generation of leaders are? [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3016.04s)]
*  Who's the next one? Who's the next one? [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3018.3199999999997s)]
*  And like, it's not that they're not going to come out of an egg. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3019.8399999999997s)]
*  Like they're going to come through what we get to see. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3023.3999999999996s)]
*  And like what we've seen is really interesting stuff. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3025.04s)]
*  We've seen Cory Booker on the floor. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3027.24s)]
*  We've seen Van Hollen go to El Salvador. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3028.3199999999997s)]
*  I like what Rose doing. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3029.9199999999996s)]
*  I like the speech by Pritzker. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3031.44s)]
*  I like seeing what Pete's doing. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3032.48s)]
*  And it's it's sort of leadership is as leadership does. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3033.44s)]
*  And I'm like heartened by what? [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3036.4s)]
*  By the Pritzker speech. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3038.2000000000003s)]
*  There are also encouraging signs from various institutions. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3039.68s)]
*  Wall Street Journal reports that a group of about ten schools, [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3042.32s)]
*  including the Ivies and the major research schools, [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3044.6s)]
*  is coordinating behind the scenes to make sure no one else folds like Colombia did. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3047.04s)]
*  Love it. You mentioned Jenner and Block, [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3051.2400000000002s)]
*  one of the law firms that refused to capitulate to Trump, [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3052.6s)]
*  how they were in court and they they were asking a federal judge [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3055.08s)]
*  on Monday to permanently block Trump's executive order targeting them. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3058.4799999999996s)]
*  The judge hasn't issued a ruling yet, but he's a George W. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3062.04s)]
*  Bush judge, seemed pretty hostile to the government's case, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3065.2s)]
*  shouting, give me a break to the DOJ lawyer who attempted to justify [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3067.64s)]
*  blocking Jenner employees from all federal buildings. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3070.8399999999997s)]
*  Based on based on the fact that Jenner and Block had DEI policies, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3074.04s)]
*  that sort of it was like a ridiculous claim. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3077.8799999999997s)]
*  They the reason that it's OK for the administration to block them [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3079.72s)]
*  from federal buildings is because they are racist. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3082.4399999999996s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3085.04s)]
*  Because and that the order can't be illegal, because what the order says is [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3086.64s)]
*  this order must follow applicable law. Yeah, that's right. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3090.52s)]
*  Also, we've talked a lot on the show about the Trump lawsuit [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3094.12s)]
*  and pressure campaign against 60 Minutes, whose executive producer [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3096.52s)]
*  Bill Owens resigned last week out of concern that Paramount might cave to Trump [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3099.3599999999997s)]
*  in order to win approval for a merger. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3103.2799999999997s)]
*  If you were wondering how the rest of the team feels about it, [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3105.68s)]
*  Scott Pelley ended Sunday night's 60 Minutes broadcast with this. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3107.8399999999997s)]
*  Bill resigned Tuesday. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3112.0s)]
*  It was hard on him and hard on us. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3113.7599999999998s)]
*  But he did it for us and you. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3116.6s)]
*  Stories we pursued for 57 years are often controversial. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3120.0s)]
*  Lately, the Israel-Gaza war and the Trump administration. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3124.48s)]
*  Bill made sure they were accurate and fair. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3129.0s)]
*  He was tough that way. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3131.36s)]
*  But our parent company, Paramount, is trying to complete a merger. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3133.48s)]
*  The Trump administration must approve it. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3138.04s)]
*  Paramount began to supervise our content in new ways. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3140.8799999999997s)]
*  None of our stories has been blocked, but Bill felt he lost the independence [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3146.3599999999997s)]
*  that honest journalism requires. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3151.68s)]
*  No one here is happy about it. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3155.0s)]
*  But in resigning, Bill proved one thing. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3157.2s)]
*  He was the right person to lead 60 Minutes all along. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3161.4399999999996s)]
*  That's angry Scott Pelley gets right there. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3165.96s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3170.56s)]
*  Hopeful signs there? [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3171.08s)]
*  No, to me, that's a very not hopeful. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3171.84s)]
*  I mean, good for Bill Owens to take some courage and guts to resign like that. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3174.2s)]
*  But I think to me, it was a sign that Trump successfully used the leverage [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3178.92s)]
*  he has as president to block this merger, to at least dissuade critical reporting [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3183.12s)]
*  or at least drive someone who's good at the job out. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3188.76s)]
*  And also, if CBS News gets sold to Skydance, [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3190.84s)]
*  I think David Ellison is notionally in control, but his father, Larry Ellison, [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3194.12s)]
*  I think is seen as like really controlling things behind the scenes. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3198.52s)]
*  David's a big dem donor. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3200.8399999999997s)]
*  Larry's a Republican donor. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3202.2799999999997s)]
*  So I don't know what that means for the future politics of the parent company. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3203.44s)]
*  But I think I think this is a just dark kind of scary moment for media. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3206.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's the son of Fred Trump [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3211.4s)]
*  with a pressure campaign against the daughter of Sumner Redstone [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3214.8399999999997s)]
*  in a fight with the son of Larry Ellison. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3218.6s)]
*  It is a nepo baby conflagration. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3221.12s)]
*  I do think that between I mean, you see why he undid the cuts [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3224.16s)]
*  to Social Security office. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3227.92s)]
*  But if Trump fucks with Medicare, Social Security payments and 60 minutes, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3228.96s)]
*  they will do to Washington what the British did in 1815. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3236.64s)]
*  I mean, it's just not you can't do this. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3240.04s)]
*  You can't do these people. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3241.92s)]
*  You do people watch every weekend. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3243.0s)]
*  They've been watching for 40 years. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3244.6s)]
*  I thought it was good that Scott Pelley said, Oh, yeah, no, it's it's. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3246.08s)]
*  And Bill Owens did it. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3248.56s)]
*  Oh, it's obviously a bad, bad. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3249.56s)]
*  It's obviously bad. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3251.0s)]
*  It's obviously bad that it's happening. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3252.56s)]
*  Cowards as corporations. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3254.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And Dan and I talked about this on the last pod, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3255.92s)]
*  but like the corporate media side of this is not where it is. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3258.04s)]
*  Not where we're going to find the real heroes. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3260.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm glad the colleges are finally banding together, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3264.24s)]
*  that some are finally banding together. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3267.96s)]
*  Good for Jenner and Block in the court. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3269.72s)]
*  I think the executive orders on the law firms are fucking ridiculous. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3272.16s)]
*  And they're like if they're not going to get laughed out of the courtroom, [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3276.04s)]
*  judges are going to yell like they did today. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3278.68s)]
*  Like they're they're not going to hold up. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3281.2799999999997s)]
*  So the law firms, the capitulator are going to be like, what the fuck are we doing? [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3282.56s)]
*  So I think that's good. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3286.48s)]
*  But I do think on the on the corporate media side, you know, these people, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3287.8799999999997s)]
*  that's what we were saying on Friday, like the for a lot of these big companies, [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3291.2s)]
*  the media outlets are a rounding error in their in their business. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3295.24s)]
*  And so they're not going to feel like they need to really stand up for it. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3298.2s)]
*  Yeah. JVL, the bulwark wrote a piece about this kind of I really, [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3301.3599999999997s)]
*  it really kind of stuck with me about the Pascal's wager of the Trump years, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3305.7999999999997s)]
*  which is if you think Republicans will seek political retribution, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3310.12s)]
*  but you think Democrats are too good of people to ever do that, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3313.2799999999997s)]
*  it creates a terrible incentive because you just go along with the Republicans [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3316.2799999999997s)]
*  because you'll never pay a price. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3319.16s)]
*  And I do think we need to be. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3320.44s)]
*  And that's what he talked about in this piece, that we need to be thinking [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3321.96s)]
*  about what it looks like for us to make clear that like [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3324.3599999999997s)]
*  we're watching what's happening here and capitulating to Trump [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3327.6s)]
*  in order to get a merger through a lots of merger to reexamine. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3330.64s)]
*  Right. Like there are there are ways in which we need to be signaling [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3333.12s)]
*  that like going along with this and the matters that Trump's becoming less [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3335.24s)]
*  popular to because this is not going to go on forever. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3337.9199999999996s)]
*  And I like the Pritzker says in a speech like we will win Congress [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3340.8799999999997s)]
*  and we will take back the White House. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3343.9599999999996s)]
*  Like people need to think that this error will end. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3345.2s)]
*  The people will look back on what happened with it, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3347.24s)]
*  with not just disgust, but like with genuine consequences. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3349.04s)]
*  Are you canceling your Paramount Plus subscription? [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3351.4399999999996s)]
*  What do I watch on Paramount Plus? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3354.12s)]
*  Survivor. I watched Survivor on Paramount Plus. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3355.8799999999997s)]
*  How about that? There you go. How about that? [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3357.7599999999998s)]
*  Still remember that? Remember when I was on that? [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3359.3599999999997s)]
*  Still, I'm taking a break. I'm in a strategic pause. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3360.56s)]
*  It's a hazy memory. Yes. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3362.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm in a strategic survivor pause, but I'll be back. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3364.0s)]
*  I think there are some smart members of Congress like Tom Malinowski. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3366.08s)]
*  I think Van Holland, Adam Schiff, people talking about [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3371.28s)]
*  what can we do now to send a message that we are paying attention, [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3375.04s)]
*  we're keeping score, and we're going to talk about this through hearings [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3379.08s)]
*  or whatever means down the road, whether it's, you know, [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3382.2s)]
*  the authoritarians in El Salvador who are contributing to the rendition, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3385.52s)]
*  extraordinary rendition of American citizens down there. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3390.2s)]
*  Like that's going to lead to future assistance cuts or these law firms [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3392.64s)]
*  that are cutting these disgusting deals and forcing their associates [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3396.44s)]
*  to do pro bono work. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3400.44s)]
*  And it's like what like cataloging it all now is very important. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3401.96s)]
*  Speaking of press freedom, we were in D.C. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3405.4s)]
*  the Correspondence Center. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3407.6s)]
*  No president at the dinner. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3409.7999999999997s)]
*  No comedian. No jokes and fascism. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3411.3199999999997s)]
*  You know, you guys notice a difference? [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3413.3199999999997s)]
*  Why would you want to? [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3415.56s)]
*  Should we just should we discuss do a couple of minutes on our? [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3416.6s)]
*  Can I tell you something? [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3419.12s)]
*  There's a little bit too much of like you can't. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3420.0s)]
*  You can't go to a party, ironically, you know, [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3423.6s)]
*  there's a little too much like as long as I say this is weird [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3426.36s)]
*  and maybe uncomfortable, I can have a couple of drinks. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3429.0s)]
*  Like there's no need to do this. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3431.12s)]
*  Like the opposite of the opposite of like you don't prove [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3432.6s)]
*  how much you take Trump seriously by like not having a couple of drinks. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3435.96s)]
*  I know I was I said this to someone who asked me that question. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3439.32s)]
*  I was like, maybe it's just because we're in L.A. all the time. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3441.44s)]
*  But I'm like, you we do this all day long. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3443.6s)]
*  Talk about this and how scary Trump is. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3446.28s)]
*  And we talk about like you got to go live your life, too. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3448.6s)]
*  I just think that like the entire White House press corps, [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3452.2799999999997s)]
*  the Correspondence Association, would be better off [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3455.12s)]
*  not pretending that weekend is about anything but a fucking party. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3457.72s)]
*  It's always been about a party. It is not about press freedom. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3461.92s)]
*  Yes, they do some good scholarships. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3464.72s)]
*  There's real speakers that talk. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3466.3199999999997s)]
*  But I have watched that room full of random celebrities [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3467.7599999999998s)]
*  talk over the children of deceased journalists who are killed in conflicts. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3471.64s)]
*  OK, this was a decade ago. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3476.36s)]
*  This is 15 years ago. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3478.28s)]
*  It was never about these high minded principles. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3479.32s)]
*  It was a bunch of people getting loaded with the guys [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3482.32s)]
*  from the hangover movies or whatever it was, which is OK. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3485.88s)]
*  Just be what you are. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3489.0400000000004s)]
*  Well, that's the thing is, I think like there was a lot. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3490.36s)]
*  Got drunk, talked to a bunch of people who hadn't seen in a while. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3492.1600000000003s)]
*  That's great. It was great. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3494.76s)]
*  And like this is why I didn't save press freedom. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3495.6000000000004s)]
*  No, it didn't do much, too much damage either. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3498.0400000000004s)]
*  But I like I talked about this with Eugene on Love It or Leave It, [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3501.88s)]
*  that like part of the like what I was disappointed by is that [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3504.4s)]
*  that Amber Ruffin, who's great, would have brought a lot of attention [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3507.72s)]
*  to journalism and like there should be a comedian at dinner [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3510.3999999999996s)]
*  because otherwise no one's going to pay attention to it. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3513.3599999999997s)]
*  That's part of what the like the weekend is all about. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3515.52s)]
*  And then I said that, like, obviously, I'm available. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3517.96s)]
*  You know, I think Alex Thompson got a lot of attention [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3522.96s)]
*  for talking about how the media should have done a better job [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3525.68s)]
*  covering Biden's age, et cetera. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3529.44s)]
*  And like there is some truth to that. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3532.16s)]
*  Alex also has a book coming out on the subject. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3533.72s)]
*  So it's a little bit self-serving, more than a little bit self-serving, [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3535.4s)]
*  if we're being honest. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3538.4s)]
*  But also, it's just an example, like, yes, maybe there could have [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3539.2000000000003s)]
*  should have been more coverage of Biden's age and mental acuity and decline. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3542.04s)]
*  But also the American people were very aware of it. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3546.92s)]
*  Yeah, showed up in every poll. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3549.76s)]
*  Every single one, every single one, even without the additional intrepid reporting. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3551.12s)]
*  Yeah, I kind of got the they kind of got the hint. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3555.88s)]
*  Yeah, he was held accountable. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3557.56s)]
*  Yeah, like it seems like a couple of these. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3559.52s)]
*  Yeah, this is the these these two journalists were picking it up. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3561.76s)]
*  I point dear listener, I thought at my house. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3566.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3567.92s)]
*  Yeah, here's Leslie Stahl, Leslie Stahl and Anderson Cooper on the case. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3569.88s)]
*  Oh, boy. Oh, boy. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3578.28s)]
*  I'm excited for the book. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3580.12s)]
*  I'm excited to talk to them on this podcast. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3581.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, we're going to talk to them. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3583.1600000000003s)]
*  Anyway, anyway, it was a good time. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3585.12s)]
*  Always good to pop into D.C. and then leave. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3587.2000000000003s)]
*  One more thing we wanted to mention before we go. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3590.2400000000002s)]
*  Semaphore's Ben Smith had a great story on Sunday about. Great story. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3591.8s)]
*  Oh, my gosh. So fun to read these private group chats over the last couple of years [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3594.8s)]
*  where the tech elite started to open up to each other about moving toward Trump. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3598.48s)]
*  Love it. You talked to Ben for YouTube special today [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3603.0s)]
*  that you can get on the Pods of America YouTube channel. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3605.76s)]
*  So check it out. But how was that? [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3607.84s)]
*  It's great. First of all, it's just it's you should just read this story. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3610.2400000000002s)]
*  But basically all of these guys that kind of radicalized a little bit [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3613.28s)]
*  during kind of the combination of, I think, covid and me too and George Floyd [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3617.4s)]
*  and felt like, you know, they would say they're like basically under like [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3621.8399999999997s)]
*  Soviet occupation, but basically they didn't feel like they could. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3624.56s)]
*  They didn't want to post what they really thought because they didn't want to stand [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3627.2s)]
*  by it or face the blowback for whatever it was. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3629.4399999999996s)]
*  So they took it to group chats ostensibly to have a kind of freewheeling, [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3631.2s)]
*  open conversation where all ideas would be welcome. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3634.08s)]
*  But they kind of slowly shift to the right and slowly become a little bit annoyed [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3636.9599999999996s)]
*  by people that aren't agreeing with them on certain issues. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3640.68s)]
*  And it includes everybody from Mark Cuban to like far right activists. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3644.12s)]
*  And all of a sudden, Carlson, Tucker Carlson. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3649.3199999999997s)]
*  But then all of a sudden, Donald Trump is president and the economy isn't doing so hot. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3651.72s)]
*  It turns out maybe stopping wokeness isn't the most important thing [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3654.92s)]
*  when the stock market loses a couple of trillion in value. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3659.44s)]
*  So it was a good conversation. Check it out. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3661.12s)]
*  My favorite piece of that story, it's not ruining anything, is there was some big [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3662.72s)]
*  group chat called Chatham House that involved like kind of a bunch of hardcore [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3667.44s)]
*  mega people and then some journalists and David Saks, the now A.I. czar, [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3671.2799999999997s)]
*  who is mostly known for being a huge douchebag, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3676.6s)]
*  the venture capitalist guy, wrote, This group has become worthless [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3679.48s)]
*  since the loudest voices have TDS. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3683.0s)]
*  So and so you should start a new one with just smart people. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3685.08s)]
*  Then it's like David Saks left the group. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3687.4s)]
*  Tucker Carlson left the group. Sean McGuire left the group. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3689.12s)]
*  Tyler Winklevoss left the group. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3691.2s)]
*  They all just left in a fit of peak. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3692.96s)]
*  It's so funny. Just it's just [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3695.52s)]
*  the whole idea is to have dissent. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3698.6s)]
*  We've got to be able to talk about things, be able to have dissenting views. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3700.32s)]
*  I talked about this with Ben, too, that like one of one. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3702.64s)]
*  They were challenged on why [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3705.68s)]
*  none of them seemed to find it a big deal that Donald Trump was denying [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3708.0s)]
*  the results of the election and like House Republicans or anybody else. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3711.0s)]
*  They have all these justifications for why they don't want to bring it up. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3715.92s)]
*  But it isn't it is interesting. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3718.7999999999997s)]
*  When are we starting one? [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3721.48s)]
*  Look, I said this on my conversation with Ben, which is [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3723.16s)]
*  I will not send Ben Smith fucking anything. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3726.8799999999997s)]

*  That's all of this one guy, Mark Andreessen, this venture capitalist [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3734.12s)]
*  who's starting all these group chats. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3737.16s)]
*  And do you guys remember why he got canceled in like 2016? [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3738.4s)]

*  catastrophic for the Indian people for decades. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3744.2s)]
*  Why stop now? [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3746.4s)]
*  He was mad about something they did to Facebook. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3747.4s)]
*  And it's like, yeah, well, you're wrong, sir. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3749.6s)]
*  He's got a few other issues. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3752.8399999999997s)]
*  But it's almost bad. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3753.72s)]
*  It doesn't like cancel. Like he got criticized. Exactly. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3754.8399999999997s)]

*  They think it's such as like a kind of both sides of their mouth thing, [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3759.44s)]
*  because it's like, oh, you know, it's it's you can't say anything. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=3762.08s)]

*  speaking, you called me and asked me to join the board of the Center for American [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4011.12s)]

*  Yes. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4019.68s)]
*  As well. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4020.12s)]
*  I don't blame you for his inauguration. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4020.92s)]
*  It was a really good time to get me to agree to something. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4023.08s)]
*  I bet so. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4026.96s)]
*  It was very clever. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4027.56s)]
*  Very clever. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4028.48s)]
*  All right. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4029.72s)]
*  Let's start. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4030.0s)]
*  The Center for American Progress was formed in 2003. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4030.8799999999997s)]
*  It really rose up to be sort of in the center of democratic resistance and [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4034.68s)]
*  opposition for more than 20 years now. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4039.44s)]
*  It was sort of the locus of a lot of thought about how to defeat George W. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4042.3599999999997s)]
*  Bush and how to build back from the loss we had in those elections. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4046.8799999999997s)]
*  It's really a center of resistance in the first Trump administration. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4049.7200000000003s)]
*  What do you think resistance in Trump 2.0 should look like? [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4053.5600000000004s)]
*  Well, I think resistance is very different from 2017. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4058.88s)]
*  We are in a very different time. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4064.2400000000002s)]
*  The president, President Trump, is much more dangerous. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4066.44s)]
*  The country was, is in a much more fertile place right now for him. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4071.6400000000003s)]
*  Fertile meaning? [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4078.0s)]
*  Fertile and I'll say, I mean, meaning essentially, you know, because he won the [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4079.1600000000003s)]
*  popular vote, I think a lot of people believe he has, you know, he has the [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4083.6800000000003s)]
*  majority with him and are much more scared of him. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4091.2000000000003s)]
*  In 2017, he lost the popular vote. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4094.48s)]
*  A lot of people thought it was a fluke. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4097.24s)]
*  So you didn't see institutions sort of pre-obey or gave. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4098.64s)]
*  So I think the moment right now is much more dangerous in a real sense because, [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4102.719999999999s)]
*  you know, I think Bannon and Trump and Russ votes look at America as a [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4109.4s)]
*  battlefield and they are really systematically, not just trying to [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4114.76s)]
*  advance their own forces, but take out oppositional organizations, things that [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4117.76s)]
*  they see as oppositional to them, whether it's the media or law firms or [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4122.639999999999s)]
*  universities or unions. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4128.76s)]
*  So the, so the country is in a much more dangerous place. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4131.2s)]
*  And also, frankly, the brand of the Democratic Party is in a very different [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4135.68s)]
*  place than it was eight years ago. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4140.2s)]
*  Eight years ago, again, Hillary Clinton didn't win the electoral college, but [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4142.28s)]
*  she did win the popular vote. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4146.36s)]
*  And also, you know, President Obama was seen as a successful president. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4147.5199999999995s)]
*  And so the party was in a much stronger position than it is now. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4152.5599999999995s)]
*  So I think, you know, resistance and opposition today has to mean three [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4158.24s)]
*  things, one really trying to drive facts about what Trump is doing and really [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4165.24s)]
*  make clear to the American people in the miasma of Greenland and Canada. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4172.36s)]
*  He's actually harming your pocketbook. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4176.84s)]
*  He's taking away security for your family, his health security, raising [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4179.12s)]
*  prices, so it's really driving that connection. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4183.76s)]
*  I also think it's vital that we create an alternative agenda. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4187.16s)]
*  So with, you know, so that people see that they have two choices of change, [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4191.5599999999995s)]
*  not just Trump's wrecking ball versus a Democratic Party status quo. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4196.76s)]
*  And then third, and, you know, I think this really goes to the democracy point. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4201.8s)]
*  We have to think about how we bolster institutions and buck them up and, and [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4205.04s)]
*  really push against institutions that want to cave to Trump, because, you know, [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4209.92s)]
*  that is also very, very dangerous and different. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4213.68s)]
*  Let's start with the institutions, right? [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4217.04s)]
*  Like you have, you have talked about in some of your interviews since returning [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4218.8s)]
*  to the set of American Progress Action Fund, that Democrats can't continue to [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4222.320000000001s)]
*  be just like neo-jerk defenders of institutions. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4226.08s)]
*  Yes. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4228.6s)]
*  Yes. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4229.12s)]
*  CAP is probably the most influential or one of the most influential of all [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4230.12s)]
*  Democratic Party institutions. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4234.240000000001s)]
*  It sort of sits at the nexus of sort of politics and policymaking and, [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4235.320000000001s)]
*  um, sort of thinking about the future of the party. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4239.56s)]
*  What is the alternative to defending institutions, um, when Trump is trying [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4242.0s)]
*  to destroy them? [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4246.6s)]
*  Like how, how do we, I guess the question is, and I think it's a fair [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4247.160000000001s)]
*  critique of all of us that like a lot of people took the lesson of the 2020 [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4251.320000000001s)]
*  election is that people did not like Trump's destruction of institutions. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4256.04s)]
*  He was trying to take down Congress, came out to University Six. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4259.76s)]
*  And so we became defenders of institutions. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4261.96s)]
*  President Biden is an institutionalist to his core, like when he was most [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4264.04s)]
*  passionate, I think in his presidency was in some of those speeches he gave about [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4268.52s)]
*  democracy and defending institutions. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4273.240000000001s)]
*  Like what's the, what's the middle ground between where Trump is and [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4274.44s)]
*  defending the broken political system? [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4279.08s)]
*  So I think this is really a central question for the party going forward. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4280.36s)]
*  And, um, I think that, uh, in many ways we sort of misread 2020 and we being [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4284.16s)]
*  all of us, all of us misread 2020. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4293.5199999999995s)]
*  Um, I think, uh, you know, every election is actually a change election. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4296.4s)]
*  Every election has been a change election since 2006, except for one. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4302.36s)]
*  And that was the president Obama's reelection in 2012, which if you think [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4305.92s)]
*  about it now, going back, it looks pretty amazing that given all the trend [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4309.52s)]
*  lines before and since it was, it's a realist standout. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4313.32s)]
*  So every election has been a change election. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4316.92s)]
*  I think one of our challenges in 2020 was that, and I speak for all of us is [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4318.84s)]
*  that we thought that it was really a restoration, you know, it was like [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4323.76s)]
*  a restoration of the order. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4328.48s)]
*  And I think it may have just been a repudiation of the form and function [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4330.4s)]
*  of Donald Trump's presidency. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4335.04s)]
*  And I really fundamentally believe that people in the country are still angry [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4337.12s)]
*  across the board about what, you know, a whole range of problems and that really [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4341.639999999999s)]
*  the tactic that, or the approach has to be, you know, that we're going to solve [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4347.8s)]
*  every problem. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4353.12s)]
*  And I think it's, this is an even more important issue for Democrats [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4354.2s)]
*  because we believe in government. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4357.5599999999995s)]
*  And so, you know, I look back and I'll say candidly, I think we should have [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4359.599999999999s)]
*  solved problems earlier. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4363.36s)]
*  You know, I wasn't there for the entire time on immigration and I didn't, you [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4366.2s)]
*  know, handle the border day to day, but I was on the immigration team and we [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4371.88s)]
*  should have handled that much earlier. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4375.2s)]
*  You mean more aggressive border security. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4377.599999999999s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4380.5199999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4381.32s)]
*  So we took actions in June of this year to really ensure that we were [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4381.719999999999s)]
*  limiting border crossings and, you know, very painful to do in the party. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4388.96s)]
*  But candidly, doing it after Trump was the nominee really communicated to a lot [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4392.6s)]
*  of people. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4398.4800000000005s)]
*  I think that, you know, if you really cared about immigration, he was the [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4398.84s)]
*  force that was making us do it. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4401.8s)]
*  If we'd solved it a year or two earlier, then maybe we'd be in a different place. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4403.6s)]
*  And I just think actually, I actually think the most important thing is that we [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4408.4s)]
*  offer solutions on a whole host of things. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4414.0s)]
*  And, you know, for example, we've been working on government reform issues. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4416.28s)]
*  Now we, it's, I'm Secretary of the Judiciary, or I guess Pete Buttigieg, [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4420.36s)]
*  if you call him now, talked about this the other day, which is, you know, it's [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4424.679999999999s)]
*  actually not reforming the government to just slash programs, but it is totally [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4428.0s)]
*  reasonable for people to want the government to work better for them. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4431.96s)]
*  So we're undertaking a project where we're providing ideas about how to make [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4435.5199999999995s)]
*  government work more seamlessly for consumers, reduce friction, make the [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4440.5599999999995s)]
*  government put the citizen at the center of of of its work instead of making [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4444.5199999999995s)]
*  citizens go through lots of hoops. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4451.44s)]
*  And that's really a, you know, product of a lot of conservatives who want to make [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4454.36s)]
*  government more difficult. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4458.4s)]
*  So we really see this as a moment, you know, where we have to offer actual [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4459.639999999999s)]
*  ideas on a whole range of issues, take more seriously where people are on some [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4464.759999999999s)]
*  of these problems. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4469.12s)]
*  Like sometimes I think, you know, coming from the administration, sometimes I [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4469.599999999999s)]
*  think we think, you know, people's concerns about an issue are really just [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4473.84s)]
*  political. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4478.6s)]
*  You know, a lot of people, I think, thought immigration was a, was just an [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4479.84s)]
*  issue conservatives were pushing instead of a legitimate concern. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4483.32s)]
*  Of course, there's insane things they're doing now. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4487.400000000001s)]
*  The people don't like that. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4491.2s)]
*  People don't like that. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4492.28s)]
*  Actually, sticking people who are legally here and prison gulags in El Salvador is [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4493.360000000001s)]
*  wrong. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4498.0s)]
*  You know, we can have a happy medium, you know, on these on these issues. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4498.68s)]
*  So I think it's I think the real challenge for Democrats right now, I mean, [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4502.4s)]
*  there's multiple challenges. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4507.72s)]
*  Yes, it feels that way. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4508.8s)]
*  It could be here for hours. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4509.96s)]
*  But a challenge for for Democrats is is not just defending institutions, you [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4511.08s)]
*  know, like I am angry at what they're doing, but I'm not sure doing a rally in [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4518.84s)]
*  front of a building is the most important thing. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4523.08s)]
*  More communicating, you know, using your channels to communicate the impact of [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4525.5599999999995s)]
*  what that is with human stories, real people's stories of how they're, you [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4530.88s)]
*  know, being divide, denied small business loans or other things or their prices [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4535.4400000000005s)]
*  are going up or they're worried about the health of their children. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4539.6s)]
*  You know, that I think is really crucial, but also it's really important to say [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4543.32s)]
*  what you would do. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4547.56s)]
*  And I think the one, you know, asymmetric benefit or asymmetric asset that Trump [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4548.76s)]
*  has is he's very good at making his opponents caricaturing his opponents as [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4553.72s)]
*  defenders of status quo. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4559.84s)]
*  Let's talk about an alternative agenda, right? [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4561.96s)]
*  This is something that's not from American Progress has worked on, you know, [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4563.68s)]
*  for as long as it's been around. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4567.16s)]
*  I remember in 2005, they worked on an Iraq plan to sort of help Democrats [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4568.12s)]
*  figure out how to get to the get to have an alternative, right? [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4573.88s)]
*  And how to end the Iraq war in a way that increases our security, which a certain [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4580.52s)]
*  senator took up. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4585.68s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4586.68s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4587.2s)]
*  I assume immigration is one of those issues in which you think we probably need [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4588.88s)]
*  an alternative. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4592.36s)]
*  And I guess sort of another question is, like, I've been thinking about this a lot. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4592.8s)]
*  I get asked question time like Democrats need an agenda, which I agree with. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4596.24s)]
*  Like it's if you don't agree with that, I'm not sure like what you really believe. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4599.599999999999s)]
*  If you're not willing to just accept that premise. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4602.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4604.28s)]
*  But there is this question of like. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4604.679999999999s)]
*  How do you like how do you communicate it? [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4607.5199999999995s)]
*  Like in 2005, you could have Senate and House leadership before it. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4609.679999999999s)]
*  And it felt like that we had a party. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4615.32s)]
*  Now it's just I just don't even know. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4618.5599999999995s)]
*  Like, like, like, how are you sort of thinking about, a, what's in that agenda? [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4620.16s)]
*  But how do you let people voters know that we have an agenda? [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4624.0s)]
*  Well, the truth is that, I mean, we will put out our agenda, but obviously [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4626.88s)]
*  it's like thousands upon thousands of conversations, right? [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4631.719999999999s)]
*  It's leaders in the House taking them up. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4635.08s)]
*  But, you know, I'd be interested. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4638.44s)]
*  It's really interesting right now. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4639.5199999999995s)]
*  You know, governors are reaching out for what do we say about immigration, [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4641.4s)]
*  particularly because they want to criticize what Trump is doing. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4644.76s)]
*  But I think they also feel a little bit of insecurity about answering, [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4649.04s)]
*  you know, what do you do about immigration at large or what do you do [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4653.4400000000005s)]
*  about the border and other things? [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4655.76s)]
*  So, you know, our our ideas, which we'll be putting out very shortly, are [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4656.96s)]
*  how to fix the broken immigration system. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4663.16s)]
*  And the truth is, our system is broken in multiple dimensions. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4666.12s)]
*  And we have the strike. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4669.72s)]
*  We have to be able to make that case. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4670.52s)]
*  So it is the problem that it is a problem that our border is not secure. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4673.12s)]
*  But really, the abuse of the asylum system started in the Trump administration [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4678.52s)]
*  and went up in the Biden administration. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4683.6s)]
*  So we should fix that problem. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4685.8s)]
*  It's also a big problem in our country that these back green card backlogs [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4687.6s)]
*  are decades old and we should fix that. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4691.56s)]
*  And I actually believe that people want more or be open to more legal [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4694.32s)]
*  immigration if they felt that their border itself was secure. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4698.76s)]
*  And so we're going to put forward ideas that basically fix [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4702.48s)]
*  all of the problems of the immigration system. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4707.0s)]
*  Not everyone's going to love our plan, I'm sure. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4709.639999999999s)]
*  But we really think it's the focus should be. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4712.599999999999s)]
*  What is the problem and how are we fixing it? [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4716.2s)]
*  And, you know, we both worked for political leaders [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4718.5599999999995s)]
*  who got up every day and thought, you know, when there's a big problem, [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4721.759999999999s)]
*  the country has to solve it. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4725.48s)]
*  And I think one of the changes in the presidency over the last couple of decades [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4726.759999999999s)]
*  is, you know, people sort of expect the president to solve problems. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4730.96s)]
*  And, you know, they're not thinking politically of like, does this issue help [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4735.52s)]
*  or her Democrats are just really trying to get solutions. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4739.76s)]
*  And I think one of the challenges is if you think about your job [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4742.68s)]
*  as oriented towards Congress and what can pass, [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4746.92s)]
*  then you think about just that dimension. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4751.6s)]
*  But if you just think if you're thinking about every problem you can solve for, [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4755.4800000000005s)]
*  sometimes that takes Congress, sometimes that takes executive action, [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4759.44s)]
*  sometimes that takes working with governors, sometimes that takes [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4762.639999999999s)]
*  trying to change the culture. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4766.5199999999995s)]
*  But you are being a change agent in in like the way you're thinking about. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4768.0s)]
*  That is something I'm going to ask you in a second about Trump's first hundred days. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4772.28s)]
*  But that is something that I was talking to Molly Murphy, [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4775.24s)]
*  who was a poster for President Biden and Kamala Harris. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4778.76s)]
*  But she was saying in her focus groups, like people don't really love [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4783.04s)]
*  what Trump is doing, but they do think he's doing things. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4786.08s)]
*  Yes. Right. Yes. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4788.8s)]
*  And so he is given the perception of action. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4789.88s)]
*  Yeah. And he's leading. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4793.24s)]
*  He's leading. And we don't actually believe he's leading. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4794.8s)]
*  Yeah. People think people see that. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4797.6s)]
*  I think he's leading us off a cliff. Yeah. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4798.92s)]
*  I guess you can be leading in bad ways. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4800.68s)]
*  He's definitely leading. Yes. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4802.360000000001s)]
*  And he's driving events instead of being driven by them. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4804.08s)]
*  Exactly. And he is. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4807.56s)]
*  And this is something President Obama used to say, which is something like [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4810.12s)]
*  sometimes you just have to get caught trying 100 percent. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4812.72s)]
*  And even if you can't like, let's say a Democrat wins [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4815.400000000001s)]
*  in twenty twenty eight, maybe we have a Democratic Congress. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4818.56s)]
*  Maybe we don't. Maybe we have a split. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4821.52s)]
*  But that president is going to be like has to seem [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4823.68s)]
*  like they are trying every day to solve the problem, [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4827.76s)]
*  even if they are limited somewhat by Congress. Right. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4829.72s)]
*  Thousand percent. And you know, I think this is this is really also [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4833.080000000001s)]
*  just changed dramatically in the way communications have changed. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4836.4800000000005s)]
*  You know, there's so much [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4841.0s)]
*  so much competition for attention. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4843.400000000001s)]
*  Right. But the presidency and the president is, you know, [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4846.400000000001s)]
*  is still the national leader of the country. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4851.04s)]
*  And I I think, you know, I think people just expect the president [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4853.4800000000005s)]
*  to solve their problems. You know, it's like [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4858.8s)]
*  I, you know, we've all had the experience where you're talking to somebody [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4861.76s)]
*  and they're basically are like, why hasn't the president fixed? [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4865.360000000001s)]
*  You know, for example, homelessness. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4868.4400000000005s)]
*  And, you know, you can get into a robust conversation [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4870.400000000001s)]
*  about actually how homelessness is mostly a localized problem. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4873.4s)]
*  It's not in most places. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4876.759999999999s)]
*  You know, most of the resources are at the at the local level. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4878.759999999999s)]
*  But this is, you know, I mean, I think this is one of the things [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4883.16s)]
*  that Trump has done, which is that, you know, he's there's no [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4885.719999999999s)]
*  differentiation in his mind between federal, state and local. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4890.44s)]
*  He will comment on anything. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4893.12s)]
*  He will. He was commenting on the changing of a mascot [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4894.799999999999s)]
*  at Long Island High School the other day. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4897.44s)]
*  Nobody else. And like he will try to direct resources on anything. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4899.48s)]
*  And, you know, I do think, you know, [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4902.72s)]
*  we both worked for President Obama and, you know, like something would happen. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4906.12s)]
*  You know, he would try to see how he can fix it. Right. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4910.88s)]
*  And even if Congress was out of the way, he'd kind of think about [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4913.92s)]
*  how he tried to fix it another way. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4917.56s)]
*  Sometimes people would malign that as like pattern pen strategy. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4919.04s)]
*  Actually, it was a how do we fix this problem strategy? [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4922.64s)]
*  People I thought it's I think it's always important to communicate [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4925.84s)]
*  that you are trying to fix a problem. Get caught trying. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4929.6s)]
*  But actually, you're trying to fix a problem, whether it's through Congress, [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4932.48s)]
*  through the executive branch or any other way. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4935.639999999999s)]
*  And, you know, I think this is the way governors think. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4937.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. You know, would it? [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4939.879999999999s)]
*  So we're coming up on the 100th day of the Trump presidency. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4941.44s)]
*  I shouldn't smile. It's very grim. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4945.16s)]
*  Well, I mean, it could it could be worse. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4947.759999999999s)]
*  We're going the 50th day. Right. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4949.48s)]
*  So it's 100 days behind us. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4950.839999999999s)]
*  What's your sort of assessment of how like there's a lot of noise, right? [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4954.12s)]
*  A lot of things. He keeps doing a lot of things. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4960.0s)]
*  Many of those things have been stopped in court or the executive order [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4961.8s)]
*  doesn't really add up to a lot of substance. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4967.56s)]
*  I mean, it's really these executive orders are like press releases, honestly. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4969.360000000001s)]
*  Like as someone who was a staff secretary, it must be quite frustrating. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4972.96s)]
*  Well, I'm also like, I just wish we could have gotten away with this tactic [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4977.16s)]
*  of just doing a press release and people are like obeying ahead of a time. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4980.400000000001s)]
*  You know, when we were in the Obama White House, I wanted [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4983.72s)]
*  and I was the communications director and I wanted to do a presidential [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4986.68s)]
*  memorandum on something and we really had to like get it done for the news cycle. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4989.32s)]
*  And obviously, as you know, there's a very robust interagency process [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4993.08s)]
*  to get it approved. And I was like, no, we have to get it done tomorrow. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=4996.44s)]
*  And the person in the secretary's office told me I was taking the guardrails [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5000.759999999999s)]
*  off government, which is I don't think that is that phrase is used [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5003.48s)]
*  very often in the Trump administration. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5008.639999999999s)]
*  I don't think they're running a process. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5012.04s)]
*  The quaint notions of like asking agencies how it would affect people. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5013.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of crazy thing. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5018.0s)]
*  But how do you think about this? [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5019.48s)]
*  What's your sort of your quick assessment of the first 100 days? [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5020.639999999999s)]
*  You know, I actually think we've turned a real corner in the last couple of weeks. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5024.0s)]
*  And I don't know if it's like Harvard stood up or Democrats [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5027.2s)]
*  getting a spine on on immigration issues like with the deportation issues. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5030.639999999999s)]
*  But I actually think that [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5035.599999999999s)]
*  or maybe it's just Trump has done so much that the levels of chaos [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5039.84s)]
*  with the tariffs and the economic [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5043.48s)]
*  the economic dislocations have all just like gone into a whirlwind. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5046.32s)]
*  But I, you know, I do think fundamentally he is in a very different place. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5049.639999999999s)]
*  And honestly, you know, he's got a great communications [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5053.5599999999995s)]
*  a range of communications assets. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5059.32s)]
*  But the the truth of the the first 100 days is that I think he will [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5060.84s)]
*  people will look back at this and say he used a lot of his political [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5066.04s)]
*  capital in ways that were ultimately squandered. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5070.8s)]
*  Most of his EOs are being shut down by the courts. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5075.0s)]
*  There are temporary restraining orders. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5079.6s)]
*  And he is actually his administration is obeying most of those TROs. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5081.6s)]
*  So I think he kind of came in and thought, I'm going to do all these executive actions. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5088.08s)]
*  And he's actually been quite limited. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5091.76s)]
*  And it's really it is really important that people are standing up. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5093.04s)]
*  I mean, this is why mass protests are really important, because institutions [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5096.12s)]
*  everybody sees that there is a strong opposition. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5099.32s)]
*  And that's been hugely critical. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5102.28s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it is if you just were assess it politically, he is underwater. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5103.72s)]
*  He's underwater. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5110.2s)]
*  The only person with lower degrees at this point is Donald Trump in his first term. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5111.16s)]
*  100 percent. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5115.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, Obama and George W. Bush from the 60s. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5115.72s)]
*  President Biden was at 54. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5118.04s)]
*  His approval rating at this point in Trump's 46, 45, 45, depending, [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5120.0s)]
*  depending on the moment in which the call comes out. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5124.96s)]
*  Let's hope it's just a trend. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5127.04s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I mean, he has lost a point every week in his approval [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5128.12s)]
*  rating for the last two months. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5131.08s)]
*  Yeah. Now, I do think and this is an important thing for all of us. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5132.48s)]
*  I do think it is it feels very different [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5135.4s)]
*  if you are in the 30s than if you're in the 40s. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5138.839999999999s)]
*  And I think institutions will treat him differently. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5141.36s)]
*  And, you know, I keep harping harping on these institutions, [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5144.879999999999s)]
*  but I will say when you look at other countries that face an authoritarian threat, [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5148.16s)]
*  it feels very different in the country when all like a whole range of institutions [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5151.599999999999s)]
*  are are just, you know, kowtowing to the administration. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5157.24s)]
*  So it is important that we keep at it and and drive his numbers down. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5161.0s)]
*  And I will say cap and cap action. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5166.360000000001s)]
*  We are very focused on driving the connection every day [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5168.12s)]
*  between a thing Trump has done and the cost to you and your family. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5172.320000000001s)]
*  Last question for you. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5177.68s)]
*  You did an interview with Ben Smith of Semaphore, where you talked about [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5179.280000000001s)]
*  one of the things you really want to understand is why, quote, unquote, [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5183.360000000001s)]
*  Bidenomics did not have the political impact you thought were. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5187.16s)]
*  Did all these things that were very good for the country, [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5189.88s)]
*  very good for a lot of the people who left our party to vote for Donald Trump [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5192.4400000000005s)]
*  in this election. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5195.96s)]
*  Have you what's your assessment on why that is or how you're thinking about it? [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5197.28s)]
*  Well, I I think honestly, lots of people are cross pressured on lots of issues. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5201.0s)]
*  And I think it's multidimensional and it's not just economics. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5206.76s)]
*  I mean, Joe Biden had an agenda for working class people. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5210.68s)]
*  It was I'm going to get the Congress to pass [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5214.04s)]
*  hundreds of billions of dollars in investments and 70 to 80 percent [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5218.240000000001s)]
*  of those jobs are going to go to people without a college degree. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5221.72s)]
*  Now, maybe we didn't communicate that, but that was definitely a strategy [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5224.88s)]
*  focused on working class people. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5228.72s)]
*  And we he talked about plants and manufacturing locations and jobs [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5231.04s)]
*  in places that had been economically left behind in red state [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5236.120000000001s)]
*  and blue state and purple states. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5239.96s)]
*  And that message was trumped by other messages in this last election. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5242.0s)]
*  Now, maybe it's also possible we didn't communicate it well. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5246.96s)]
*  Always a possibility. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5250.12s)]
*  So I think we should understand that. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5251.56s)]
*  But I also think there's two other things that are going on [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5252.76s)]
*  that we also have to wrestle with. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5257.0s)]
*  First, there are kind of security issues, culture issues where, you know, [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5259.44s)]
*  I mean, I do think a range of voters thought of immigration [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5264.8s)]
*  as a kind of economic issue as well. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5268.4s)]
*  The right really focused on large numbers of people coming in [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5271.28s)]
*  and raising rents and other issues. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5274.92s)]
*  So that's something that I think we have to wrestle with and address [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5276.68s)]
*  and actually address, which we're working on. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5279.76s)]
*  But I also think and this is I, you know, I kind of defer to you [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5282.52s)]
*  where I think there's just a constant drumbeat online and elsewhere that [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5286.280000000001s)]
*  by the right, well funded, that says liberal elites [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5294.88s)]
*  look down on you as a working class person. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5298.8s)]
*  They judge you. Their values are different from you. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5301.320000000001s)]
*  And I think there's two ways to approach that. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5304.639999999999s)]
*  First, we should we should, you know, figure out our own mechanisms [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5306.48s)]
*  of communication. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5311.0s)]
*  But I also think we have to go out of our way in instances [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5312.2s)]
*  where that might feel like it's happening to to to distinguish ourselves, [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5316.5199999999995s)]
*  say that's wrong, go out of our way to really listen to people. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5321.879999999999s)]
*  You know, I mean, I think, you know, there's this big, robust debate [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5325.4s)]
*  about where things are in the party. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5328.36s)]
*  And, you know, and I think we have to wrestle with the fact that [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5330.4s)]
*  white working class people, not all working class people, [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5334.08s)]
*  but white working class people have voted for a billionaire three times. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5336.92s)]
*  And like, how do we impact that? [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5340.72s)]
*  And how do we question our own assumptions when we do that? [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5343.4800000000005s)]
*  And an increasing share of nonwhite working class people, [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5346.04s)]
*  which I think is the part that really, I think, flummoxes a lot of how [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5349.320000000001s)]
*  a lot of people thought about politics in the Trump era. Right. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5354.320000000001s)]
*  And I think honestly, we have to think about economics [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5357.04s)]
*  from a fairness perspective. Absolutely. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5360.4400000000005s)]
*  But I think for a lot of people, young people, [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5363.32s)]
*  the working class people of color, we lost, particularly the men. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5365.88s)]
*  You know what I've heard from a lot of people doing analysis [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5369.04s)]
*  is that they have been really focused on economic success, opportunity. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5372.48s)]
*  Like, how do their family does it, how their family will do better. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5376.88s)]
*  And I think that like that is another that's an area [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5379.36s)]
*  where we have to come up with ideas. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5383.2s)]
*  And Cap Cap will be working on that over the next several months as well. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5385.28s)]
*  The hard part is, I mean, there's sort of a twofold problem here. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5389.64s)]
*  Like, as you mentioned, there's a communications issue. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5393.0s)]
*  Yeah. Just people did not have the information like that [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5394.96s)]
*  did not break through to people at all. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5398.04s)]
*  Like you would like I saw all the polls, which is like what did you know? [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5400.4800000000005s)]
*  Did Biden do all these things? No. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5404.0s)]
*  Here are the things Biden did. Do you like them? Yes. Yeah. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5405.72s)]
*  Now, but it was interesting there is it did not lead to [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5407.8s)]
*  them to vote for him. Vote change. Yeah, change. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5412.360000000001s)]
*  But that's like the business. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5414.56s)]
*  The business is in everybody. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5415.88s)]
*  You know, people like a lot of things. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5417.84s)]
*  It's like what persuades them to vote for you over the other. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5419.320000000001s)]
*  And I think one thing is a party we have to think about is. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5422.0s)]
*  Like we need you need the policy, right? [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5426.16s)]
*  You need the ideas. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5427.64s)]
*  But we have to think about economics as an identity issue. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5429.0s)]
*  100 percent, which is like, am I like, are you am I fighting for you? [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5433.28s)]
*  This is what Trump is very good at. Right. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5437.28s)]
*  It's like they think some group of people think that he'll fight for them. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5438.8s)]
*  Right. Like he had an advantage in this election just because he was not [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5442.76s)]
*  the incumbent at a time of inflation. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5445.360000000001s)]
*  And people remember lower costs from his age. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5447.400000000001s)]
*  But in general, all of this stuff, this like absurd [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5450.48s)]
*  policies that don't really make a lot of sense or would only address a small [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5454.799999999999s)]
*  portion like the no tax on tips. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5458.36s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a good signifier. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5461.04s)]
*  Yes. You know, it was a signifier to voters that he got what it's like [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5463.919999999999s)]
*  to be a waitress or a waiter because he was really focused on that issue. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5468.12s)]
*  I mean, I think we should learn lessons from that. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5472.44s)]
*  We need to signify our policies where we're we're communicating like we get this. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5474.12s)]
*  We get what it's like. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5478.24s)]
*  I mean, I think sometimes we think about the biggest policies. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5480.24s)]
*  But I guess my take on on, you know, on everything you're talking about is. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5483.48s)]
*  He has an advantage, which is, you know, he will say [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5490.5199999999995s)]
*  kind of crazy things that nobody would know. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5495.08s)]
*  No political advisor would tell you to say. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5497.5599999999995s)]
*  So people are like, well, he's obviously being candid. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5500.08s)]
*  And, you know, he has a whole frame of I'm fighting for you [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5502.76s)]
*  because he gets attacked a lot. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5506.96s)]
*  And he has a way of speaking. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5509.28s)]
*  And, you know, I think we have to do many things. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5511.679999999999s)]
*  But I think the fundamental problem or a fundamental issue [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5515.44s)]
*  is that he has a he himself says, and there is a constant message machine [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5518.8s)]
*  that liberals look down on you and hate you and distrust your values [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5523.5199999999995s)]
*  and don't know what your life is like. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5527.96s)]
*  And that's there's a way to talk about that. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5529.639999999999s)]
*  There's a way to communicate about those issues. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5531.8s)]
*  I mean, no one really remembers this, but the, you know, [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5533.92s)]
*  President Obama's share of working class voters. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5536.84s)]
*  And white working class voters was higher than our last several nominees. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5539.16s)]
*  And and he was a black man and they were white. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5545.76s)]
*  And he was but he was but he was an outsider. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5549.72s)]
*  Yeah, but he was an outsider. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5551.96s)]
*  He was an outsider. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5553.32s)]
*  And he had a populist critique of Romney. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5554.08s)]
*  And also, I just think there's and he was, you know, [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5557.76s)]
*  he was arguing for change in multiple ways. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5560.24s)]
*  So and he was running, you know, John McCain was an institutionalist. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5562.4s)]
*  So I think there's, you know, we just have to be super mindful of talking [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5566.24s)]
*  like, you know, representing ourselves as champions of change, [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5574.24s)]
*  but also, you know, champions of people who are struggling every day. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5577.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, Nira, I could talk to you about this for hours, [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5581.32s)]
*  and we probably will offline. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5583.72s)]
*  But thank you so much for being here on Potsdamerica. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5585.8s)]
*  And it's always great to talk to you. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5587.5199999999995s)]
*  Thank you so much. Thanks for having me. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5588.679999999999s)]
*  That's our show for today. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5591.08s)]
*  Dan and I will be back with a new show on Friday. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1rF8-vz3Io&t=5591.96s)]
