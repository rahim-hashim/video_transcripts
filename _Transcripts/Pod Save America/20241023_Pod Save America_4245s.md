Video Description: Donald Trump’s former chief of staff, John Kelly, goes on the record about Trump praising Hitler, meeting the “definition of a fascist,” and the “disturbing” idea of using the military against domestic opponents. Dan and MSNBC’s Alex Wagner break down how damaging this might be for Trump, and how Kamala Harris is trying to use it to her advantage. Plus, they look at the Harris campaign’s message and strategy in the final two weeks, including rallies with Barack Obama, Eminem, and Bruce Springsteen. Then, Jon talks with Senator Sherrod Brown about his must-win race in Ohio.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Trump's Top Former Staff Call Him "Fascist" and Denounce His Fascination With Hitler
**Pod Save America:** [October 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0)
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Dan Pfeiffer. And I'm Alex Wagner. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=0.0s)]
*  On today's show, Donald Trump's former chief of staff, John Kelly, goes on the record to [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3.68s)]
*  confirm that Trump praised Hitler and thinks he can use the military against domestic political [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=7.92s)]
*  opponents. Kamala Harris sharpens her closing argument and Barack Obama raps with Eminem. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=12.08s)]
*  Then, Senator Sherrod Brown stops by to talk with John about pulling out an all-important [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=16.88s)]
*  win in Ohio. With me to discuss all of it is my friend Alex Wagner, host of Alex Wagner tonight [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=21.04s)]
*  on MSNBC and a fixture of their special election coverage. Alex, thanks for being here. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=26.32s)]
*  It's a thrill and an honor, Dan. You were on the ground in Pennsylvania for a few days this week. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=31.36s)]
*  Yeah. And you did a live show from there last night, right? How was it? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=35.92s)]
*  I sure did. It was a lot. I was with Victor Martinez, who's the number one Latino radio [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=38.08s)]
*  host, Spanish language radio host, and based out of Allentown. I was at a barbershop in West [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  Philadelphia. I was meeting with Trump-supporting Republicans in East Philadelphia. I was with John [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=49.76s)]
*  Fetterman in Red counties for Trump. It was fascinating. And I got to say, I got an earful. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=56.48s)]
*  I got a lot of perspective. But if you ask me which way that state's going to go, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=65.2s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised if Harris won it tidily or Trump won it tidily or it was neck and neck [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=70.64s)]
*  and we didn't get the vote count for 14 days after election day. It just feels incredibly [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=77.28s)]
*  unpredictable and very, I won't say volatile, but just unknowable in a way. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=82.64s)]
*  That really feels like this election. Unknowable. Yeah. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=87.84s)]
*  All right. Let's get into the news today. For as long as Donald Trump has been around the presidency, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  he's had staff who walk away and tell people how disturbed and scared they are about his [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=96.0s)]
*  stewardship of the country. The problem is they hardly ever go on the record with those charges. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=99.68s)]
*  Less than two weeks before the election, however, Trump's longest serving chief of staff, retired [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=104.16s)]
*  Marine General John Kelly, did an on the record recorded interview with New York Times reporter [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=108.16s)]
*  Mike Schmidt. Let's take a listen. What do you think? Do you think he's a fascist? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=112.96s)]
*  Well, I'm looking at the definition of fascism. Those are the types of things that he thinks [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  will work better in terms of running America. The former president is in the far right area, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  certainly an authoritarian, admires people who are dictators. He has said that. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=133.04s)]
*  So he certainly falls into the general definition of fascist for sure. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=141.6s)]
*  He comments more than once that Hitler did some good things too. And of course, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=148.88s)]
*  if you know history, again, I think he's lacking in that. But if you know what [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=154.79999999999998s)]
*  Hitler was all about, it would be pretty hard to make an argument that he did anything good. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=160.8s)]
*  If you know what Hitler is all about. Look, it's hard to be shocked by. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=166.4s)]
*  Peel back the onion on Hitler. Peel back the onion. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=170.16000000000003s)]
*  A complex figure. It's hard to be shocked by new revelations about Trump thesis, but I do think [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=173.68s)]
*  hearing the audio from one of his closest advisors saying that Trump praised Hitler is a fascist is [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=178.72000000000003s)]
*  shockingly should be. What do you make of this report? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=184.72000000000003s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think first of all, like when the conversation begins with so, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=187.12s)]
*  do you think he's a fascist? Let's just say like we are in a different space with this candidate. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=192.16s)]
*  And the TLDR of that John Kelly answer is like, if it looks like a fascist and it walks like a [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=199.76s)]
*  fascist, it's a fascist. If you have a former general who is by all accounts, not a hair on [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=204.88s)]
*  fire liberal, like someone who is as into the concept of law and order as anyone else, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=214.32s)]
*  as any person could be, not as anyone else. And he's out there saying Trump's a fascist. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=222.4s)]
*  Yeah, it should alarm everybody. I mean, I think the issue is there is, especially among Trump [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=226.56s)]
*  supporting, you know, voters out there, a disbelief that he'd actually carry through on it. Like, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=232.32s)]
*  yeah, sure. He likes dictators. Sure. He's, you know, into light fascism or not light fascism, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  just full on fascism. But is that really going to come and affect my life if he's reelected? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=242.72s)]
*  And that's the fundamental problem here. Having said that, I think there's every reason to focus [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=249.68s)]
*  on this. I think that it should alarm everybody. I don't think we should sane wash his comments. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=254.4s)]
*  And like, it's obvious that Donald Trump isn't a student of history or a student period. So like, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=259.52s)]
*  when he says Hitler did some good things, that doesn't mean he's reading some like deep cut [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=265.76s)]
*  history of, you know, Hitler. It's just that he has a personal, there's a proclivity towards, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=270.32s)]
*  you know, Hitler style fascism. And he can't really explain it except he can't explain it away except [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=277.76s)]
*  to say that like, in his mind, he believes that Hitler wasn't all that bad, because in his mind, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  he agrees with Hitler. Yeah, it's not like Donald Trump is so deep into the history of World War II [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=287.52s)]
*  era Germany that he's familiar with, I don't know, the public works projects of Germany or something [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=293.52s)]
*  like that. Exactly. He knows only what the most basic thing to know about Hitler is, and it's not [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=297.92s)]
*  good. Right. He knows Holocaust. He seems to not have a giant problem with that or be not be disturbed [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=303.2s)]
*  by the idea of praising someone who did that. It is incredibly alarming. Well, it's revealing. I [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=310.48s)]
*  mean, I think it's revealing. I think these two things together are extraordinarily revealing. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=316.08000000000004s)]
*  You know, he may be a wannabe fascist, he may ultimately be a failed fascist, but [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=320.96000000000004s)]
*  fascism is where he's at. And the you hit on what is has been the challenge of this Trump will be a [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=325.12s)]
*  dictator on day one argument, which Democrats have been making since Biden was the candidate. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=332.0s)]
*  And the fundamental challenge of that argument is that for all of the terrible things that Donald [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=336.08s)]
*  Trump did as president, most people do not believe he was a dictator. Now, what we're learning from [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  some of the accounts of the presidency, the Trump presidency that came out afterwards, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=348.64s)]
*  what we're learning from Kelly in these interviews, what we've learned, like 14th hand [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=351.84s)]
*  double secret code from Jim Mattis and Mark Milley is that Trump tried to do these things and he was [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=356.79999999999995s)]
*  stopped or distracted or whatever else from a series of people. And what we also know is [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=365.35999999999996s)]
*  those people are no longer going to be around him. Right. He had one lesson Trump has learned [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=370.4s)]
*  since 2020. And he's not somebody learns a lot of lessons, but is that he wants enablers around him. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=373.91999999999996s)]
*  And so instead of the people with the big names and the stars on there and the medals and all of [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=378.4s)]
*  that, he wants someone who's going to do what he wants. And so there will not be. So if John Kelly, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=382.64s)]
*  as he talked about this interview, did make it harder for Trump to use military force against [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=387.44s)]
*  American citizens, the next person may not will probably not do that. And that's and that's very, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=392.0s)]
*  very scary. Now. Yeah. Yeah. Right. We have John Kelly, a four star general, saying he's a fascist. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=396.96s)]
*  We have Mark Milley telling Bob Woodward that Trump is a fascist. We have all these alarming [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=403.52s)]
*  accounts. We have a report in the Atlantic, which has people talking about Trump, most likely Kelly [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=410.15999999999997s)]
*  talking about Trump wanting to use military force against his against domestic political enemies, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=416.32s)]
*  the enemy within the thing he is saying on the campaign trail all the time. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=421.68s)]
*  And it's a huge deal. But it doesn't feel a little bit like we're sort of like people aren't alarmed [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=425.76s)]
*  enough that it happened. Come on, let's get the same. We'll talk about a minute. It's getting [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=431.84s)]
*  some coverage, but just like we're kind of numb to it. Am I right? Do you get it? I think it's two [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=436.0s)]
*  things. One is there hasn't been enough championing of the Stooges around not championing. There hasn't [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=441.91999999999996s)]
*  been enough focus maybe on the Stooges around Trump in part because it's about the Trump show. But [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=449.2s)]
*  you remember garbage pail kids down? Do you are you? It's like there should be in the way that I [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=453.84s)]
*  think there's a there's much broader understanding of Project 2025. It would have been slash it would [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=460.16s)]
*  be great for Democrats to say like these are going to be the arc. These specific people are [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=465.68s)]
*  going to be the architects of a second Trump administration instead of just like this policy [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=469.44s)]
*  paper. These are the real human beings who are going to let Trump unleashed do whatever he wants [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=474.48s)]
*  to do. I mean, maybe that would help in the context of showing that what came before is not [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=479.44000000000005s)]
*  what will be in a second term. You won't have those same sort of career professionals, people [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=484.8s)]
*  who care about the Constitution in the White House. You'll have this bunch of clowns. But the second [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=490.08s)]
*  piece of it, which I think speaks to the broader question of why this doesn't resonate more, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=495.36s)]
*  it doesn't pierce the veil, if you will, around Trumpism and Republicans drawn to Trump is I think [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=500.56s)]
*  for as many reports as you have of Milley or Mattis or Kelly coming out and saying this guy is a [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=506.56s)]
*  fascist. You also have events like the one last week where Trump standing on stage at a town hall [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=513.28s)]
*  and dancing to Ave Maria and Hallelujah for 45 minutes, right? You have him like slinging fries [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=518.0799999999999s)]
*  to a bunch of like vetted Trump supporters who have been cleared by Secret Service at a McDonald's. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=524.48s)]
*  You have him in these kind of absurd situational kind of political comedies that I think make [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=530.16s)]
*  people think, oh, he's not that bad. I think it reminds them of their crazy grandparents or their [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=538.0s)]
*  crazy uncles, which now apparently is an asset in American politics, where they say outlandish [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=544.08s)]
*  things, right? They do things their way, but they're not actually a harm to the rest of the [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=549.92s)]
*  family. And so there's always a point counterpoint. And I would also say most of people who are in the [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=555.04s)]
*  tank for Trump or excited about him aren't reading The Atlantic, right? They may hear passing mention [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=561.92s)]
*  of the fascism stuff, but the dancing on stage cuts through the noise better because it's [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=567.28s)]
*  memeable. It's on the internet. I just think the sort of political comedy of the Trump candidacy [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=572.48s)]
*  is more widely known than the darker, you know, fascistic tendencies that he has embraced and [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=580.0s)]
*  will embrace in his potential second term. So, you know, I think it's a problem. Like his character, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=585.68s)]
*  a character study of Trump is necessarily, I can't believe I'm saying this, kind of a complicated [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=590.72s)]
*  thing in that way. Yeah, I would say that's right. There's a lot of issues there. He really [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=596.56s)]
*  could have used a lot of therapy is my take. Oh my God. Yeah, definitely. Maybe some medication. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=602.16s)]
*  All the above. A couple of points here. One, you know, the inevitable, this part of the discussion [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=608.4s)]
*  is, is anyone going to care is going to make a difference. And one of the challenges we have, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=612.8s)]
*  which is why it's going to be incumbent upon Democrats and the Harris campaign to make people [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=615.68s)]
*  know about this in the next few weeks, is just the distribution pipes of media are broken. Most [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=620.7199999999999s)]
*  people are never going to see this, not just because in the Atlantic and the New York Times, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=624.32s)]
*  but there are things were in the Atlantic and New York Times for decades and they would eventually [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=626.8000000000001s)]
*  reach people because they would be on it would be in their local paper, which they would see every [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=630.88s)]
*  morning when they went to check out the sports scores. It'd be on their local news, which they [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=635.36s)]
*  would watch every night before dinner because they wouldn't know what the weather is going to be the [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=639.6800000000001s)]
*  next day. It would show up in their Facebook feed because Mark Zuckerberg thought it was a great way [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=641.9200000000001s)]
*  to make money by distributing news for free to the public. None of those things happen anymore. So [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=646.5600000000001s)]
*  so much of the conversation only happens among political junkies who opt into political media. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=652.64s)]
*  So it's not going to get or it's not going to osmotically get to voters. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=659.1999999999999s)]
*  The second thing here is, and you hit on it really right, is that what people usually see about Trump [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=663.8399999999999s)]
*  is him talking about Arnold Palmer's manhood or serving fries or the dancing. That's a generous [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=668.16s)]
*  term for it anyway. Sorry. It's manhood. We know specifically what you're talking about. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=674.16s)]
*  I'm just trying to keep this show. I know a lot of our listeners. I don't do a good, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=679.52s)]
*  I don't do a great job of this. I use the F word a lot, but there are a lot of people. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=683.1999999999999s)]
*  You won't say that word penis. Definitely don't say that. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=686.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if you listened to last episode, but whatever our yearly allotment of [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=689.36s)]
*  dick jokes is, John John and Tommy way surpassed it. So we're really in the back end. Manhood. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=693.1999999999999s)]
*  We'll go with manhood. Yes. Or what is putter was his putter. Arnold Palmer's, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=699.52s)]
*  the size of Arnold Palmer's putter. That does defang some of the scary stuff. But I just want [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=705.04s)]
*  to say this, which is it does feel unlike 2020, like we are ambling into the abyss here as a society. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=711.4399999999999s)]
*  I agree. Everyone knows how dangerous he is. He is telling us the things he's saying on the stump [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=720.56s)]
*  are way more dangerous than they were then. And now it's not a theoretical exercise because he has [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=726.16s)]
*  instigated a violent insurrection that led to the loss of lives. It is real. We know what's happening. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=731.28s)]
*  And I'm glad John Kelly did this interview. I'm glad he did an audio interview with the New York [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=736.8s)]
*  Times. He should be commended for that. But if you truly, truly believe that Donald Trump is [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=742.4s)]
*  a fascist who wants to use military force on his domestic political opponents, you have to do more [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=747.76s)]
*  than call Mike Schmidt. And the same goes for James Mattis and Mark Milley and all these other [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=753.28s)]
*  Trump people, Mike Pence, other Republicans like George W. Bush, people who were saying, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=759.68s)]
*  I don't really like Trump, but I'm going to write in, I don't know, Ronald Reagan's spleen [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=764.0799999999999s)]
*  or whatever you're going to do in your ballot. If this is really as bad as you say it, is you [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=767.8399999999999s)]
*  have to do more. There's that story in the New York Times the other day about how Jamie Dimon and [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=772.56s)]
*  Bill Gates and these other business leaders are for Kamala Harris, but they're afraid to say it. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=778.64s)]
*  If you truly believe that Donald Trump is this dangerous, you have to do everything possible [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=782.8s)]
*  to stop him. And it doesn't feel like it's a society we're doing that. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=787.76s)]
*  No, it doesn't. I mean, the fact that Dick Cheney came out before George W. Bush, who so obviously [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=791.36s)]
*  is voting for Kamala Harris, is just shocking. The idea of the presidential club, it's a rap on that. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=796.72s)]
*  He should be out there campaigning for Kamala Harris. I will say also as not a student of [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=805.12s)]
*  history, but someone who's just passing understanding of what has happened, fascists and [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=809.92s)]
*  dictators also do loony old grandpa style things too. We should seek no comfort in the idea that [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=815.6s)]
*  he loves YMCA. That is not going to prevent him from jailing journalists and going after political [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=823.44s)]
*  opponents. I mean, Fidel Castro has all sorts of personality, had all sorts of personality [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=830.08s)]
*  and idiosyncrasies. My mom's from Burma where there's a military junta in charge. Those guys [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=834.24s)]
*  are pretty wacky too in their off hours. This is all actually the portfolio of behaviors [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=839.12s)]
*  around dictatorial tendencies and fascists. I don't mean to underscore, I don't mean to [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=845.92s)]
*  undermine the notion that he's an incredibly dangerous, that I just don't think people think [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=851.92s)]
*  of it that way. I think it's like we have this Marvel comic book conception of villainhood. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=855.76s)]
*  It's like you're all evil all the time or you're a good guy. Donald Trump has the ability to make [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=862.96s)]
*  people laugh as he shreds the constitution. I honestly think the fact that those Republicans [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=867.04s)]
*  have not come out and that they're not endorsing Kamala Harris and why ever Mitt Romney isn't [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=874.88s)]
*  endorsing Kamala Harris has to do with some, I think, personal reluctance to fully wrap their [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=879.2s)]
*  arms around the danger that is being posed by a potential second Trump term. They are alarmed [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=886.16s)]
*  because of personal experience, but it's shocking to me that they haven't made the leap towards [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=892.08s)]
*  doing everything they can to stop him. That suggests that something's holding them back. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=897.68s)]
*  And that, I mean, it's to the credit to the Cheney family for doing this, who seem to at least [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=902.56s)]
*  understand that their era in Republican politics is over. Or if it's ever to come again, it has [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=906.0s)]
*  to begin with stopping Donald Trump. I don't know that George W. Bush would make a huge difference. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=911.6s)]
*  He's not that popular. He's kind of seen as a failed president turned painter, but still, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=917.52s)]
*  just leave it all in the field. The painting's amazing. I'm a huge fan of the painting. I wish [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=923.12s)]
*  he had started with that. If he had just had a really inspiring art teacher in seventh grade, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=927.28s)]
*  perhaps American history would be changed for the better. If he had just gone to Jerry Gagosian [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=935.52s)]
*  instead of the ranch at Crawford, Texas. Anyway, we'll never be able to undo those eight years. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=941.4399999999999s)]
*  But yeah, I'm not saying it, I guess what I'm saying is it's not that I think George [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=948.56s)]
*  Bush would be some incredible campaign surrogate. But I do think there is this, I mean, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=953.04s)]
*  this moment is about a sort of cultural norms and people feeling like they are inside or outside of [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=958.56s)]
*  the America that wants to preserve democracy. And really, it's like, you want everybody who's a fan [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=965.4399999999999s)]
*  of democracy, you want a groundswell of that sort of support to be obvious to anyone that is voting [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=971.4399999999999s)]
*  in this next election. And the more people you have inside the tent of the pro-democracy tent, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=980.0s)]
*  I think the better that is in convincing anybody who's still on the fence or sitting on their [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=984.16s)]
*  couch and unsure of whether they actually want to vote. And this is not a crazy argument. Actually, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=988.16s)]
*  the folks at Blueprint poll tested closing arguments. And the best testing closing argument, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=992.08s)]
*  especially with independence, is this idea that most of Trump's cabinet and senior staff are not [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=997.44s)]
*  supporting him. So you can only imagine that his former chief of staff, who also happens to be a [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1003.36s)]
*  four star general, being on the record saying these things would help with that. So more people [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1007.68s)]
*  doing that is good. Okay. The vice president this morning went out and gave a brief statement to the [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1012.4799999999999s)]
*  press reacting to the Kelly interview. Let's take a listen. It is deeply troubling and [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1019.5999999999999s)]
*  incredibly dangerous that Donald Trump would invoke Adolf Hitler, the man who is responsible [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1024.8s)]
*  for the deaths of 6 million Jews and hundreds of thousands of Americans. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1032.56s)]
*  All of this is further evidence for the American people of who Donald Trump really is. This is a [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1041.04s)]
*  window into who Donald Trump really is from the people who know him best, from the people who [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1047.52s)]
*  worked with him side by side in the Oval Office and in the Situation Room. And in a second term, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1054.88s)]
*  people like John Kelly would not be there to be the guardrails against his propensities [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1062.16s)]
*  and his actions. Those who once tried to stop him from pursuing his worst impulses would no [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1068.96s)]
*  longer be there and no longer be there to rein him in. So the bottom line is this. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1076.4s)]
*  We know what Donald Trump wants. He wants unchecked power. The question in 13 days will be [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1084.8000000000002s)]
*  what do the American people want? Thank you. What did you think of her message? I mean, right on, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1092.48s)]
*  right? I'm interested to know how this happened. I mean, Dan, I'm not an expert on the Hatch Act, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1099.76s)]
*  but she made those remarks in front of her official vice presidential residence, the Naval [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1106.64s)]
*  Observatory. Do you guys know that? Do you know the answer to this, Dan? I do know the answer. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1111.68s)]
*  Yeah. What is the answer? Well, one, the legal interpretation will allow her to do this, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1115.92s)]
*  as I understand it, is the same one that allowed President Biden to talk about Trump in his day [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1122.16s)]
*  of the union, which I know seems like 100 years ago, but was really nine months ago. And that is [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1127.76s)]
*  that because Trump is the former president, you can talk about him. He's a public figure. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1133.44s)]
*  And what she can't do is raise money or say vote. Got it. I mean, I just think it adds another layer [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1138.72s)]
*  of gravity when you're talking about Trump and saying the words Hitler and fascist. And I thought [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1148.48s)]
*  it was really important. And look, I think there is a phenomenon here where I talked about [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1154.16s)]
*  sane washing. Everybody's been talking about that. I know you guys have been talking about that. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1159.1200000000001s)]
*  Like these comments, these audio tapes, these deserve a real platform. They deserve [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1163.12s)]
*  focus. They should drive the news. They aren't normal, despite the fact that they've been [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1169.52s)]
*  echoed over the years. We are reaching a crisis point. And I think it's right for her to highlight. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1173.6s)]
*  I think it's right for her to highlight it. I think her speaking in very serious terms about [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1179.36s)]
*  what has been unearthed by a phone call with Mike Schmidt and the Atlantic and Jeffrey Goldberg is [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1184.6399999999999s)]
*  absolutely right. I mean, as a matter of political strategy, I don't know what it does. But I mean, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1190.48s)]
*  I don't know if this is the thing that moves people with 13 days left to go. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1199.04s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if it moves people either. I think doing the statement is the right thing [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1204.32s)]
*  because it kind of like the Atlantic story came out and it got a lot of online attention. I'm sure [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1207.1200000000001s)]
*  I didn't, I was able to watch TV. I'm sure you guys talked about it on MSNBC last night. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1213.68s)]
*  And then the Mike Schmidt interview happened a little later in the day, I guess, or at night. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1219.04s)]
*  I couldn't really tell when that happened. And that is even more damning to Trump because now [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1222.96s)]
*  you have the audio, which matters a lot in this media environment because that audio can now [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1228.0s)]
*  travel the world on TikTok and Instagram and elsewhere in a way in which just the written [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1234.1599999999999s)]
*  words just can't. It's not the right medium for this media moment. But if you want something to [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1238.24s)]
*  be a story, you got to go make it a story. And one way you make it a story and you make it part [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1245.28s)]
*  of the conversation is to go talk about it. Give it more, give it more pictures, give it more audio [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1248.56s)]
*  for it to circulate to people. Because the only way the people who are going to sign this lecture [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1252.6399999999999s)]
*  and to see it is they're not picking up the New York Times to see it. It is the New York Times [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1256.24s)]
*  runs it. Kamala Harris talks about it. A bunch of people then talk about it on social media and [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1262.72s)]
*  TikTok and whatever else. And then it randomly shows up in their feed because the algorithm [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1267.68s)]
*  chooses to show it to them. And so you got to just pour gasoline on the fire. So I think that's the [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1271.6799999999998s)]
*  right thing to do. From a message perspective, what I really like about this is she tries to [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1276.8799999999999s)]
*  go right at the concern you raised at the top of this pod, which is if he wasn't addicted before, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1281.4399999999998s)]
*  why would this time be different? If he didn't shoot people last time, why would he shoot people [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1285.84s)]
*  this time? And she makes the point that John Kelly and people like John Kelly will not be around him [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1288.8s)]
*  next time. And so that has changed the context from which Trump is operating is changed. He's [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1293.12s)]
*  now surrounded by people who will let him do these things. And so just because it didn't happen [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1298.4s)]
*  before doesn't mean it'll happen now. Now there's a lot more work to do to make people to hamper [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1302.48s)]
*  that message home in a very little amount of time. But I thought the way she did it there was right. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1306.4s)]
*  She needs to have like a picture or a fat head of Roger Stone and Stephen Miller on either side. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1310.88s)]
*  Like these are the guardians. This is what we're looking at America. Just saying. Do you think [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1315.68s)]
*  putting up a large pictures of Stephen, Stephen Miller is a good way to win an election or a bad [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1321.0400000000002s)]
*  way to win? No, I mean, listen, that's who is going to be his minder. That guy and the other [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1324.4s)]
*  guy who wears a bowler hat for fun. I mean, you know, these people can't be trusted. We don't [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1329.92s)]
*  want to get into what Roger Stone does for fun. Fair point. It's a family show. It's a family show. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1335.76s)]
*  Okay. With less than two weeks to go, Kamala Harris is getting in front of every voter possible. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1342.3200000000002s)]
*  She's doing a CNN town hall in Pennsylvania tonight, then has a rally with Bruce Springsteen [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1346.72s)]
*  in Obama tomorrow in Atlanta and a rally with Michelle Obama in Michigan on Saturday. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1351.2s)]
*  In between all those things, she's going to Texas on Friday for a rally focusing on abortion rights, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1356.16s)]
*  where she'll record an interview with Brene Brown's podcast. And yesterday she sat down with Hallie [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1360.32s)]
*  Jackson of NBC News, your sister network for an interview that aired on nightly news last night. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1364.88s)]
*  Let's take a listen. Last election, the former president came out on election night and declared [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1368.96s)]
*  victory before all the votes were counted. What is your plan if he does that again in two weeks? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1373.76s)]
*  Well, let me say this. We've got two weeks to go. And I'm very much grounded in the present [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1378.16s)]
*  in terms of the task at hand. And we will deal with election night and the days after as they come. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1383.12s)]
*  And we have the resources and the expertise and the focus on that as well. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1389.52s)]
*  So you have teams ready to go? Is that what you're saying? Are you thinking about that as a possibility? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1395.28s)]
*  Of course. This is a person, Donald Trump, who tried to undo the free and fair election, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1398.64s)]
*  a free and fair election, who still denies the will of the people, who incited a violent mob to [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1405.36s)]
*  attack the United States Capitol and 140 law enforcement officers were attacked. Some were killed. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1411.92s)]
*  Would you consider if you win and he's convicted a pardon for former president Trump? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1418.16s)]
*  I'm not going to get into those hypotheticals. I'm focused on the next 14 days. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1422.48s)]
*  But do you believe, is there any part of you that subscribes to the argument that has been made in [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1428.3999999999999s)]
*  the past that a pardon could help bring America together, could help unify the country and move on? [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1432.16s)]
*  Let me tell you what's going to help us move on. I get elected president of the United States. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1436.24s)]
*  A lot of tough questions are on a whole bunch of topics. What did you think of the interview? [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1441.8400000000001s)]
*  I thought it was good. I think Halle asked her some questions that, yes, we would love a vice [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1445.52s)]
*  presidential candidate and potential president to answer, but I absolutely get why she would not [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1450.48s)]
*  negotiate with her. She was asked in part of that interview what concessions she was prepared to [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1455.44s)]
*  get to restoring Roe v. Wade and getting it through Congress. The question about a pardon [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1460.8s)]
*  to Trump, I mean, who in their right mind would even float that 13 days before an election? [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1468.16s)]
*  I got to say, I thought her answer on the post-election period was interesting, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1475.3600000000001s)]
*  because honestly, as someone in the media, that's the period that I'm the most worried about, given [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1481.6s)]
*  what happened last year and given just how much, I mean, honestly tighter this race could be, how [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1486.16s)]
*  much longer it could take to get the vote, how much preamble there's been about election fraud [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1490.72s)]
*  and the election monitors that have been deployed by the RNC and then the freelancers who are out [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1496.3200000000002s)]
*  there. And I would say even on the left, a concern that there's going to be chicanery and that we [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1501.68s)]
*  can't necessarily trust the results in certain swing states. So I'm deeply worried about that [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1506.0s)]
*  kind of volatile environment. And I get why Harris wants to focus on election day. I also [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1510.48s)]
*  get as a public official that she doesn't want to stir up paranoia and fear and potentially [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1516.32s)]
*  violence by suggesting there's going to be something bad. But I would, as a candidate, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1521.2s)]
*  like to hear more about the army of lawyers that will be deployed and the ways in which there is a [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1527.04s)]
*  strategy in place, as I'm sure there is, to combat the misinformation, the disinformation, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1532.96s)]
*  and trying to push the country towards at worst violence and maybe at best just even deeper division [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1538.56s)]
*  around the results of the election. So I guess I understand her posture in that interview, but [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1548.8s)]
*  I wish there had been more from her on that answer in particular. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1557.52s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, look, there were a whole bunch of questions here that were tough to answer. I [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1561.04s)]
*  thought she navigated it well. She pivoted to message at several points, which is what [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1563.44s)]
*  you want to try to get out of this. On to your point about the post-election period, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1568.24s)]
*  I have great confidence that the Harris campaign has a massive, well-funded, well-thought out [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1572.64s)]
*  legal strategy. Like I'm very confident in that. And I'm curious to know what, if anything, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1580.64s)]
*  they're going to be able to do to fight the post-election misinformation. A lot of the [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1587.92s)]
*  guardrails that existed in 2020 and they didn't go great are not there anymore. There's less [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1591.6s)]
*  fact-checking in the media, even some of the fact-checking. We sort of now know that the [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1595.92s)]
*  limits of fact-checking in general, the social media platforms were spending a lot of time and [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1600.5600000000002s)]
*  energy to try to keep disinformation and misinformation from going viral on a platform. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1606.3200000000002s)]
*  They're not doing that anymore to any extent at all. The owner of one of the larger social [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1611.2s)]
*  media platforms is the number one purveyor of some of the worst conspiracy theories out there. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1615.8400000000001s)]
*  So that's going to be a real messy period. I'm sure that they have very, very smart people who [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1620.16s)]
*  I know have been thinking about it, but I am also, and I understand why they're not giving [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1624.0s)]
*  us the playbook in advance, but I am curious about what they will do with the limited tools [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1627.36s)]
*  available to them to push back on Big Lie 2.0. I think it's going to be incumbent on members [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1632.0s)]
*  of the media to do a lot of that work too, which is we do a good job sometimes and we do a very [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1637.2s)]
*  bad job other times. So we got our work cut out for us. Yeah. I will say to the credit of the [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1641.76s)]
*  media, and that's not something I do a ton, a lot of lessons were learned after 2020 about, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1646.48s)]
*  you know, it took especially after January 6 about how to cover Trump when he's lying about [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1652.4s)]
*  the election. Some of those have been unlearned pretty dangerously since then, but I have faith [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1657.68s)]
*  that a better effort will be made from at least the best intentioned players in the space. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1664.0s)]
*  So- Which is definitely not me. I mean, I know that already. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1669.92s)]
*  You were among the best intentioned in the space. I was specifically referring to you. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1673.28s)]
*  Yeah. In addition to the interview with NBC, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1677.76s)]
*  Harris also did an interview with Telemundo, but those were the only two events on her campaign [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1680.6399999999999s)]
*  schedule. I'll say she had no trips to the battleground state. I just laid out her ROE [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1684.9599999999998s)]
*  schedule to come, but the fact that she was not actually campaigning in a battleground state [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1688.8799999999999s)]
*  less than two weeks before the election became a topic of conversation. Some folks feel her [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1694.4799999999998s)]
*  schedule is not robust enough or as robust as say Obama's was in 2008, 2012. What do you think [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1698.3999999999999s)]
*  about how she's been campaigning? Yeah. I mean, first of all, I applaud the [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1704.0s)]
*  fact that she's doing more media. That's great. She had been basically locked in the cupboard [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1707.2s)]
*  for the first six or seven weeks of her campaign. And to some degree, I understand that, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1713.28s)]
*  but at the same time, it's time and it's good. And I think she's been comporting herself really, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1716.96s)]
*  really well. I am loathe to suggest that Kamala Harris isn't working her ass off to win this [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1720.56s)]
*  election. I would like to believe there is a reason she is not in a battleground state [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1730.8s)]
*  and is instead doing interviews in Washington. The reality is the more the public sees of Kamala [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1735.2s)]
*  Harris, the more they like her. So they should be putting her out as often as possible. I think [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1742.96s)]
*  she'll probably have a punishing schedule for the last 10 days of the race. So maybe they're just [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1748.8s)]
*  trying to give her a reprieve and do a day of media. I guess I'm just as a member of the media, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1753.2s)]
*  I don't question the decision because the fight is so clearly at everybody's doorstep. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1758.88s)]
*  I don't think they're making kind of thoughtless decisions at this point. That seems to be a piece [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1768.24s)]
*  of campaign strategy. But maybe, Dan, you can tell me otherwise that this is like the campaign [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1772.48s)]
*  strategist whiffed this one and she should have been out in Georgia. I don't know what the reason [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1777.2s)]
*  was, but there's a reason. I know the people who run our campaign, General Mellie Dillon, David [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1781.92s)]
*  Plouffe, Stephanie Cutter, all those folks, they believe to their core, and I've done many campaigns [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1787.4399999999998s)]
*  with them, that the best thing is for the candidate to be in front of voters. Now, people keep [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1792.24s)]
*  comparing it to Obama's 2008 schedule. He did all this stuff every single day. The better comparison [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1796.1599999999999s)]
*  is to his 2012 schedule when he was president at the same time that he was running. And sometimes [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1801.6799999999998s)]
*  you have to do things as vice president. I don't know what those things were yesterday. Maybe that's [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1805.76s)]
*  what she was doing, but she is out there a lot. She's out there more than Trump. And so there is [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1809.52s)]
*  a reason here. I just don't know what it is. And there's not a fiber in my body who believes [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1815.2s)]
*  that she was in Washington doing interviews, which is a way to communicate with voters, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1820.32s)]
*  but that she was in Washington because the campaign thinks they have this in the bag [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1825.1200000000001s)]
*  or she's not working hard enough. That's just not the reason. There is a reason. They just haven't [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1828.72s)]
*  shared it with us and maybe we'll find out before, but she was doing something and certainly [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1831.68s)]
*  something that contributed to either her job as vice president, which is important, or to win the [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1836.0s)]
*  campaign in some other way. Maybe there's some other interviews we don't know about. Maybe it [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1842.24s)]
*  was taping ads. It could be absolutely anything. It could have been between two ferns with Zach [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1845.6000000000001s)]
*  Kalifianakis and then we'll really say thank you. The eventual of one, it'll be over because that's [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1849.92s)]
*  what will happen. It's pretty rare for a candidate. We just talked about the importance of being in [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1854.0s)]
*  battleground states. Texas, not a battleground state. The Harris campaign has been cleared. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1860.0800000000002s)]
*  They're not going there because they think they can win it. They're going there to highlight [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1863.28s)]
*  abortion. Do you think this is a smart decision? Yeah. I think the abortion thing is so interesting [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1866.24s)]
*  because in my conversations with male voters, particularly in battleground states, it hasn't [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1871.76s)]
*  really resonated in part because Michigan has protections. Pennsylvania has a few more [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1875.6s)]
*  protections. There's not the sense of doom and threat in the same way that there is in abortion [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1881.76s)]
*  deserts like Texas. I think if it's not going to give her a win in Texas, it could kick Ted Cruz [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1887.44s)]
*  out of office. Like, choose the turnout among people who understand the stakes, who are feeling [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1894.0s)]
*  the excruciating choices they have to make, just either to start a family or not have a family or [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1899.28s)]
*  whatever their personal choice is and help maybe control the Senate in the process. It's a super [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1904.8799999999999s)]
*  important issue. I think Texans should be reminded and probably need to be reminded about what [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1912.6399999999999s)]
*  sending Colin Allred to the Senate means versus sending Ted Cruz when there's the prospect of [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1920.8799999999999s)]
*  a national abortion ban on the table. I think it's the right thing to do. You know this, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1926.0s)]
*  Dan. Just because she's in Texas doesn't mean the words she says stay in Texas. They will be clipped [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1932.0s)]
*  and they will be put on the internet and she will be renewing the focus on reproductive choice in [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1937.6000000000001s)]
*  the closing days of the election. I think that's absolutely right. She should be doing that. By [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1942.3200000000002s)]
*  the way, we'll be having our own reproductive rights focused special on MSNBC that I'll be [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1946.3200000000002s)]
*  co-anchoring with Joy Reid next week in case people want to talk more. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1951.12s)]
*  I love that organic promo. That's great. What day is that? [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1955.52s)]
*  October 30th. I say that in part because I feel like we are talking, and I think necessarily so, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1958.56s)]
*  about fascism and democracy and the economy and immigration. Abortion is a huge driver for [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1967.28s)]
*  Democrats, a real tangible result of what it means to have a Republican in office. It is good to [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1972.2399999999998s)]
*  you know focus back on that before people go to the polls because I do think to some degree [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1977.84s)]
*  that has not been as sharp. We have not had as sharp a focus on that from the Harris campaign [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1982.8s)]
*  in her closing argument. I fully endorse this decision to go to Texas. Obviously if she can [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1990.32s)]
*  provide a boost to Colin Allred and he can kick Ted Cruz out of the Senate and back to Cancun, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=1997.12s)]
*  that is a super plus. But even more importantly, what she is desperately trying to do here is get [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2001.2s)]
*  attention. The audience is yes people in Texas, but it is primarily the exact voters you were [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2007.2s)]
*  talking about in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, places that have Democratic governors or [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2011.2s)]
*  constitutional rights to abortion access. To say to those voters, if Donald Trump wins, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2016.4s)]
*  what you see in Texas when it comes to abortion policy could very well be the national policy. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2022.72s)]
*  Trump could pass and sign a federal abortion ban. He could, as Project 2025 has suggested, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2028.64s)]
*  use executive authority to make it hard to get abortion medication, impossible to get abortion [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2034.48s)]
*  medication. In Project 2025, they want to have a database of pregnancies. There is scary stuff [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2040.4s)]
*  here. What is happening in Texas could be the nation. It is so hard to grab people's attention [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2046.3200000000002s)]
*  in this media environment. Going to Texas, giving a speech in Texas is off the beaten path. It is [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2052.0s)]
*  different enough. We are talking about it now. It will get more coverage than if she just gave [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2056.88s)]
*  an abortion speech in Michigan on the same day. She is trying to get attention. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2060.08s)]
*  It is the geographical equivalent of going to Fox News, right? [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2065.52s)]
*  Yes. It is disruptive. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2068.4s)]
*  Yes. It is why Trump is going to Madison Square Garden. Same. It is a way to get people's attention. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2070.88s)]
*  The other thing we just have to, it is a sad thing for democracy, but the importance of [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2076.7999999999997s)]
*  local media in politics, it is still quite important, but it is way less important, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2081.44s)]
*  particularly for the undecided voters who consume less media. Politics is national, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2085.52s)]
*  news is national. Going to Texas is almost as good a way to reach a lot of voters in Michigan as [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2090.64s)]
*  doing a speech in Michigan. It is not great that it is not all local DV and local news anymore. That [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2096.08s)]
*  was an important part of the process, but the world has changed, the media economics have changed, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2101.28s)]
*  and so the efficacy of going to a place like Texas in 2024 is very different than it would have been [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2105.68s)]
*  back in my day in 2008 or 2012. That is where we are at. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2111.44s)]
*  Obviously, abortion is going to be a huge part of her closing message. How do you think she should [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2115.2s)]
*  balance that with the economy and border security messaging that we also know that undecided voters [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2119.2799999999997s)]
*  are very concerned about? It is so hard. Can I just say, this poor woman, my Lord, who wants this? [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2124.24s)]
*  Nobody wants to be in this position. She did not ask to be, right? [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2132.3199999999997s)]
*  I mean, everything, everywhere, all at once, she has got to do it all. That is just the reality of [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2136.16s)]
*  it. She is talking to different voters. She is talking to suburban women when she talks about [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2141.68s)]
*  abortion. I wish she was talking to everybody. She is talking to men, working-class men, especially [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2145.7599999999998s)]
*  when she is talking about the economy. She is talking to the Latino vote. She is talking to [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2150.72s)]
*  more working-class Americans when she is talking about immigration. I mean, she is just talking [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2157.6s)]
*  to each segment that she needs to turn out, so she is going to have to do it all. I think that [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2160.48s)]
*  just the reality of what a closing message is when you are literally building the biggest possible [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2166.56s)]
*  tent you can. What is amazing is that it is held, that the party of AOC and Dick Cheney is still, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2172.96s)]
*  you know, the bandwagon drives onward, hopefully ending at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. It is a [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2180.2400000000002s)]
*  testament to the Democratic Party that this coalition has held for as long as it has, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2186.6400000000003s)]
*  with nary a peep from, I mean, accepting a few certain issues, mostly with everybody in a court. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2192.8s)]
*  I think it is amazing. So, yeah, I mean, she is going to have to talk to all the different, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2202.0s)]
*  you know, sort of buckets of voters who may be sitting on their butts, unsure of whether [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2205.44s)]
*  they want to vote or skeptical of the fact that she will be four different years of a [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2209.1200000000003s)]
*  Democratic administration and will not be a continuation of what they believe has not been [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2212.32s)]
*  a good moment for them financially or economically, though that is not true. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2216.4s)]
*  And she has got to remind people of fundamental, you know, bodily autonomy and how it is on the [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2220.56s)]
*  ballot. So, yeah, I mean, it is not as, it is not the sort of polished stone that was the Obama [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2225.2s)]
*  candidacy in 2008 where you knew exactly what you were getting and it was this beautiful glowing [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2232.08s)]
*  thing that you could hold in your hands. It is more like, you know, emotional confetti. That is [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2236.32s)]
*  the description I always use. It is just like, it is in the air, it is everywhere, it is all around [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2241.2s)]
*  you and, you know, all the little bits together kind of make, I do not know, a celebration of [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2247.2s)]
*  her candidacy. This is an overwrought metaphor. The point is, it is, yeah, it is everything [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2252.24s)]
*  everywhere all at once and that is what she has got to do. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2257.2s)]
*  Yeah, I really toured about this because the ways in which we communicate are so different, [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2260.9599999999996s)]
*  right? It was just in, back in 2008, 2012, even 2016, it was largely you needed one core [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2266.24s)]
*  message for everyone because you were communicating to everyone in the same way. Yes, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2276.3199999999997s)]
*  you could do like some, you know, black radio or you could do some Spanish language TV or something [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2279.52s)]
*  that would be a little micro targeted, but in general, it was all macro communication all the [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2286.3999999999996s)]
*  time. Your TV ads were large, could reach anyone at all times. Now there is the ability to target [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2289.9199999999996s)]
*  even more, right? You can have, you can identify the voters who feel a certain way about a certain [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2295.52s)]
*  thing and you can push messaging towards them via digital advertising or influencers or whatever [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2300.16s)]
*  else. Like you can, we just have so much richer data about how to end so many more tools to reach [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2305.68s)]
*  people, but ultimately you still have to put it through one frame, right? And I have struggled [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2309.7599999999998s)]
*  with this the whole campaign. The closest thing I come up with for one way to latch all these things [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2315.52s)]
*  together is that Kamala Harris is for you and Donald Trump is for himself. And then that's how [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2319.44s)]
*  you get to abortion, freedom. That's how you get to her economic plan versus his economic plan. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2325.04s)]
*  And it's the way you get to border security because it allows you to tell the story as she [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2331.84s)]
*  does at every opportunity that the reason the border is not as secure as it should be is because [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2336.32s)]
*  Donald Trump torpedoed a bipartisan deal to help himself. So if you want someone to fight for you, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2341.76s)]
*  Kamala Harris will do it. Because the one core essential truth about Donald Trump that even [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2346.6400000000003s)]
*  in their private moments, his supporters would admit is that he's a narcissist, that he cares about [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2351.36s)]
*  I was at a barbershop in West Philadelphia this on Monday. And one of the guys said, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2356.08s)]
*  I've made more money with assholes than with nice people. And I think one of the problem, [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2361.68s)]
*  I think you're right. That is very elegant sort of distillation of how Kamala Harris can sell [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2367.6s)]
*  herself to people who are still on the fence or to even people who support her. Donald Trump, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2373.04s)]
*  Kamala Harris is for you, Donald Trump is for himself. We underestimate the lure of a man who's [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2377.84s)]
*  only out there for himself. And I see, I saw and heard that reflected in especially the men that [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2383.44s)]
*  I spoke to that that was actually aspirational. And that the greed, you know, it felt like the [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2389.52s)]
*  1980s, right? Like greed is good. And that the narcissism wasn't off putting, but like, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2394.4s)]
*  you know, that's someone who wanted to be like, and that's someone who was maybe going to help [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2399.44s)]
*  you get rich just because it provided a template from the highest echelons of government for [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2402.8s)]
*  everybody else in the country. I'm obviously not endorsing that, but I just mean, I think that's [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2408.32s)]
*  part of the reality here is that, and that's a testament to like where we've gotten as a society, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2414.4s)]
*  but that there is, there is a kind of the subject of that, that, what do we call it? Thesis, [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2420.6400000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump is, is maybe not, he doesn't do so badly in that dichotomy. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2428.7200000000003s)]
*  I think that's exactly right. I mean, that is ultimately the entire thesis of Trumpism, which is [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2434.96s)]
*  I, I will protect you from whatever threats you're worried about domestic or abroad, and I will put [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2440.0s)]
*  more money in your pocket. And because that will do those two things, you're willing to put up with [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2446.48s)]
*  me as a largely embarrassing asshole, right? You may not like my personality. You may not like my [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2450.32s)]
*  tweets. You may not like the way I act. You may be somewhat concerned about the fact that I keep [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2454.72s)]
*  getting convicted of federal crimes and state crimes. But because I will do those things that [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2458.8s)]
*  matter the most to you, right? In the hierarchy of needs, those are the top, right? Safety and [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2464.5600000000004s)]
*  financial security. And if I can protect those, you'll put up with everything else. Now, what is [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2470.32s)]
*  essential then is for the Democrats and the Harris campaign to, you have to make it, you have to make [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2474.48s)]
*  how this matters for people, right? So it's not just like he, we don't like Trump because he's a [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2479.84s)]
*  narcissist. He only cares about himself and therefore he's a bad person. It's because he [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2484.32s)]
*  only cares about himself. He's going to help people like him and not people like you. And [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2487.76s)]
*  that's a hard argument because people think they did well under him before. But the tax cuts for [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2490.88s)]
*  the rich, finding a way to talk about the increase in prices because of tariffs, talking about the [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2496.2400000000002s)]
*  restrictions of your freedom on abortion and everything that can come next. That's the hard [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2502.48s)]
*  term. This is not easy. If it was easy, we would have beat Trump in 16. 2020 wouldn't have been so [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2506.48s)]
*  close and he would not even be running again, but it's not easy. Okay. Even with Harris off the trail [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2511.2000000000003s)]
*  for a day, Democrats are in get out the vote mode and Kamala Harris has been absolutely [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2515.44s)]
*  blessing the battleground states and so are her top surrogates. On Tuesday, that meant Barack [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2519.92s)]
*  Obama holding a rally with Tim Walz in Madison, Wisconsin and Obama in Detroit with Senate candidate [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2524.64s)]
*  Alyssa Slotkin and who else? Eminem. I would just say my old boss was feeling himself at this event. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2529.36s)]
*  Let's take a listen. Can the real Slim Shady please stand up? [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2534.4s)]
*  People shouldn't be afraid to express their opinions and I don't think anyone once in America [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2540.08s)]
*  where people are worried about retribution of what people will do if you make your opinion known. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2544.64s)]
*  I think vice president Harris supports a future for this country where these [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2553.2s)]
*  freedoms and many others will be protected and upheld. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2557.2s)]
*  And here to tell you much more about that, President Barack Obama. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2564.4s)]
*  I gotta say, you know, I have done a lot of rallies so I don't usually get nervous, [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2569.92s)]
*  but I was feeling some kind of way following Eminem. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2580.88s)]
*  And I noticed my palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2586.96s)]
*  I'm not even ready. Bombing on my sweater already, mom's spaghetti. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2593.36s)]
*  I'm nervous but on the surface I look calm and ready to drop bombs but I keep bomb forgetting. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2598.96s)]
*  I mean, look, I'm biased here but was that great or was it kind of cringe-worthy? I don't really know. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2609.52s)]
*  Both. I mean, it was great. It's also like Barack Obama loves his own performances. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2614.6400000000003s)]
*  Yes. As someone who knows him, Dan, you know this to be true. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2621.28s)]
*  Also, I mean, that song that he was dropping lines from is his like hype myself up song. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2627.84s)]
*  Am I incorrect? That is an Obama musical chestnut. So I'm sure it was awesome. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2634.2400000000002s)]
*  And also I had missed the slotkin Eminem tour when it rolled through New York so I was glad to be [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2641.6s)]
*  able to catch a little bit of it. It's great. First of all, I'm all for Joy. I loved the beginning [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2646.32s)]
*  of the Harris candidacy because she was just happy. It was such a good moment. It was a reprieve from [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2657.36s)]
*  the just apocalyptic doomsday scenario we now find ourselves in again. And when he's having fun, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2662.8s)]
*  when he's smiling, you can't help but smile. Having said that, there was a slight daddish edge, [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2669.52s)]
*  a little bit of a daddish edge to it. You knew he practiced that before he went out there. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2675.6s)]
*  That was not impromptu. Honestly, I don't know. There's a real chance he didn't. I have to believe [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2682.32s)]
*  this. He didn't practice Amazing Grace. Dan, I think it was impromptu. Dan, it was impromptu. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2688.7200000000003s)]
*  The lyrics were impromptu. Anyway, but props. I can just say, if I had been with him at the time, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2693.52s)]
*  I could know how this would go. We'd be in the car driving there. He'd be like, you know what? [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2701.04s)]
*  He'd be like, Pfeiffer, you know what I think I'm going to do? And I'd be like, what, sir? He's like, [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2704.88s)]
*  I think I'll just do maybe the first verse or two of Lose Yourself. And I would be like, [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2708.64s)]
*  that's an idea. I hear you. I hear what you're thinking. I don't know. And he'd be like, I'm [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2713.2s)]
*  doing it. And then he would do it. And I would worry about it. And he'd do it. And it would go [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2719.2799999999997s)]
*  well. And so I felt this to my core. Can I just say, Dan, contrast that with the people who have [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2723.68s)]
*  to keep Trump in line. I think I'm going to shoot protesters in Lafayette Square, sir, versus I think [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2729.92s)]
*  I'm going to rap. I just want to tan suit, the worst thing he ever did, which was actually a [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2739.2000000000003s)]
*  great outfit. You were on the record as that, that is for sure. I loved that tan suit. And I told him [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2744.7200000000003s)]
*  I liked the tan suit to his face. He appreciated it. You know what? Because he walked around telling [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2751.12s)]
*  everyone how good he looked in that suit for, frankly, years afterwards. I think he did it just [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2756.16s)]
*  pretty recently. So you're preaching to the choir there. It's cool that he rapped. It's cool. It's [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2760.72s)]
*  great. Like, fine, good. The politics should be fun. Right? You want a rally to be fun. You want [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2766.64s)]
*  your movement to feel like something you want to join. You want people to stop what they're doing, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2775.68s)]
*  to be involved. You want them to stop what they're doing and listen. And that has always been Obama's [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2779.92s)]
*  great ability. Harris has done it herself incredibly well here. Tim Walz did it in a [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2784.4s)]
*  very funny way by calling Elon Musk a dipshit yesterday. In a weird, bizarro way, Trump does [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2790.1600000000003s)]
*  the same thing for his supporters. And it shouldn't be spinach. It should be fun. It should be [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2795.6800000000003s)]
*  entertaining. There should be risk involved. And so I think it is great he did it. It's obviously [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2799.84s)]
*  dominating social media. More people will see more of the rally because of it. Eminem's message is [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2805.92s)]
*  cool. Eminem speaks to a certain group of voters. And so all of it was great, in my opinion. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2811.36s)]
*  Now, how his daughters felt, who knows? Oh, we know how they felt. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2817.84s)]
*  In general, what do you think of the role Obama's playing down the stretch here? [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2822.6400000000003s)]
*  It's great. I mean, look, I think sometimes he kind of steps, he gets a little over his skis. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2825.36s)]
*  I think the scolding of black men in Pittsburgh, just from the men that I talked to, did not come [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2829.6800000000003s)]
*  across the way that I think he perhaps had hoped it would. But it changed the conversation. And [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2834.6400000000003s)]
*  I think that was very, very useful in terms of gender and how much of the resistance to [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2840.48s)]
*  Harris's candidacy in electing her was because there's still some latent or explicit misogyny [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2844.88s)]
*  holding people back. That I think is good. But he's magic. He's the most magical person [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2851.2s)]
*  in the Democratic Party and has an ability to crystallize the issues and the stakes [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2856.64s)]
*  and do it with passion and eloquence and joy and bring in the fucking reinforcements, right? [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2860.56s)]
*  Bring him in and then the closer Michelle Obama is going to be hitting the trail too. Of course, [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2867.36s)]
*  this is what needs to happen. Yes, everybody come out of the woodwork. And it's nice to be reminded [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2871.52s)]
*  of the once in a generation talent that he is and feel good about the fact that he was elected twice [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2880.24s)]
*  and that we were that country. And maybe we can be a country that does that kind of thing once more. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2887.84s)]
*  Obviously, I think he's a huge net positive out there. He's a great communicator. He [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2893.2799999999997s)]
*  does a lot for signaling to the entire party how to talk about things. And he did that in 2020 [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2896.4s)]
*  with Trump a lot. And then in 2022, he did a similar thing about how he's the best [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2902.2400000000002s)]
*  messenger in terms of distilling the argument and then delivering in a very compelling way. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2907.04s)]
*  I did have this lingering fear that it's been a long time since he was president. It's been a [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2911.2000000000003s)]
*  long time since. Oh, wait, I see that in my own gray hairs and aging self. And one of the huge [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2915.12s)]
*  target audience here is the younger men. And so it's like, does Obama really have a connection [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2922.0s)]
*  to them? But then the folks at Blueprint came out with this poll where they pulled men. And so here's [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2925.6s)]
*  Obama's approval rating among men aged 18 to 29. He is a plus 38 net favorability. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2931.68s)]
*  That's not nothing. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2939.36s)]
*  That is, I mean, and he's by far exponentially more popular than any other political figure [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2940.7999999999997s)]
*  out there with this exact group of people that Kamala Harris absolutely needs to [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2945.2799999999997s)]
*  do better with if she's going to win this race. And so the fact that we have polling here, [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2950.4s)]
*  which shows that Obama is the best messenger with them. And that's why he's doing so much. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2954.4s)]
*  He's doing these rallies, but he's also doing a ton of events or like interactions with [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2959.12s)]
*  TikTok influencers. He did a podcast today with, he was interviewed by Tyrese Halliburton of the [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2963.76s)]
*  Indiana Pacers. So he's doing a lot of stuff to reach that group. So that's very good to know [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2971.36s)]
*  that it has the impact. He still has that appeal with the young voters she needs even all these [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2976.64s)]
*  years later. I think it's really important also for it to be a man [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2980.7200000000003s)]
*  alongside her doing this, not because she needs a man, but because the question of masculinity is so [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2985.04s)]
*  there's so much tension around it. And Obama is so confident in his manhood and so clearly [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2992.1600000000003s)]
*  masculine. You know what I mean? Not that Tim Walz isn't, but he's such a known sort of male [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=2999.12s)]

*  Of course. All right. You've been running and winning statewide races in Ohio for many years [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3207.2s)]
*  now. What if anything is different about your state and what you're hearing from voters this [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3212.48s)]
*  time around? Well, Ohio's perhaps got a little more conservative. People think that, but last [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3218.4s)]
*  November we passed the statewide constitutional amendment of abortion rights, passed it with 57% [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3223.36s)]
*  of the vote, which my opponent in this race wants a national abortion ban. So one of the clear [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3230.08s)]
*  contrasts we make, he says I'm 100% pro-life, no exceptions. I have supported the constitutional [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3236.48s)]
*  amendment or abortion rights. So we make that contrast. And I think that that's going to be [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3242.88s)]
*  an absolute voting issue this year, as it is other places, both in the privacy of the presidential [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3247.6s)]
*  and especially in the Senate race. So what's different about Ohio is I think I win, in large [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3252.8s)]
*  part, because I take on interest groups and stand up to the drug companies and stand up to big oil [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3259.2s)]
*  and stand up to the railroads, which had that terrible derailment in Eastern Ohio. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3264.96s)]
*  And that's the reason, one of the reasons that big money is going after me in this race. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3270.96s)]
*  Has political polarization made it harder than it was back in 2018 when you won in 2018, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3275.12s)]
*  you ended up picking up a lot of Trump voters? You have to in your state. Is that a little bit [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3281.36s)]
*  harder this time around? It's harder only in the sense that so many people, I mean, there are only [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3287.6s)]
*  I believe six Senate seats now, six states which have a split delegation of one R and one D or an [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3295.52s)]
*  independent. And I mean, the assumption I think too many people make is that they're voting for [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3301.12s)]
*  Trump, they're not voting for me. But I mean, I don't look at politics left or right. I look at [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3307.04s)]
*  it more as who's siding you on. And I was in Zanesville today with a UAW plant. And Zanesville [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3311.28s)]
*  is a small industrial town, very conservative, kind of the northern edge of Appalachia. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3317.52s)]
*  I will get a lot of votes there because people know I fight for workers. And regardless how they [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3322.4s)]
*  vote in the presidential race. And that's, my mission has always been to put workers, [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3326.7200000000003s)]
*  the workers should be at the table and talk about the dignity of work, a term from Dr. King initially [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3334.1600000000003s)]
*  that he used. And I think if you stand up to interest groups like I have, it means [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3340.08s)]
*  tens of millions of dollars are spent against you. But it means that voters, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3346.08s)]
*  regardless of how they're looking in the presidential race, are likely to vote for [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3349.84s)]
*  somebody that they see as on their side. What do you make of a lot of unions in this cycle? [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3353.6800000000003s)]
*  You see a lot of the union, the leadership is for Kamala Harris and for Democrats, some of the rank [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3359.6800000000003s)]
*  and file sort of drifting towards Trump. Seen that in places in Michigan, I've heard union members [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3364.8s)]
*  be interviewed say that some of their fellow workers are a little more pro-Trump. I've heard [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3371.44s)]
*  that in some other states. What do you think's going on there? [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3376.08s)]
*  Yeah, I wear when I have a suit on, I wear a pin. It's a canary in a birdcage. You know the story, [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3379.2s)]
*  Jonathan, mine workers used to take a canary down to the mines when they didn't have a union strong [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3386.4s)]
*  enough for a government that cared enough to help them. He was really on his own. And I wear that [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3391.2s)]
*  pin signifies to me that workers are the center of what we should fight for in government. I don't [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3395.7599999999998s)]
*  know that Democrats around the country have focused on that the way that we should. And workers, [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3403.76s)]
*  that symbol also means to me that when, you know, we didn't, 100 years ago, Wall Street didn't come [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3408.48s)]
*  to us and say, hey, I think we should start Social Security, take care of seniors. We fought for it, [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3417.0400000000004s)]
*  we demanded it, we got it. The polluters didn't come to us and say, it's time to clean up Lake [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3421.92s)]
*  Erie. I want to help. We had to force them, demand it and make it happen. We didn't create Medicare [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3427.28s)]
*  because the health insurance interests wanted to help us. Civil rights didn't happen [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3433.6800000000003s)]
*  because a bunch of Southern segregationist senators had time to give them the vote. I mean, [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3437.92s)]
*  it's really similar. I think the Democrats need to fight more on these issues that matter to [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3442.32s)]
*  everyday people. And I don't know that national Democrats have figured that out well enough. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3449.28s)]
*  And I can see in Ohio, it's why as a party we slipped a little bit. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3455.36s)]
*  Talk to me about Bernie Moreno. What have you found is the most persuasive argument [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3460.48s)]
*  to people who are thinking about voting for him? You mentioned, of course, [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3465.28s)]
*  his stance on abortion. What else are people finding troubling? [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3470.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, he's a, as you say, he's a car dealer, luxury car dealer. He has cheated his own [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3474.8s)]
*  workers. Raphael Warnock was in town the other day for me. And he said, and Moreno had to pay [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3480.8s)]
*  $400,000 in back pay to workers who he had stiffed out of their overtime and then destroyed the [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3489.36s)]
*  evidence that a judge ordered him to produce. And Raphael said, how would you trust a guy who [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3494.32s)]
*  treats his own workers that way? Why would you think he'd treat workers around the state in any [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3501.6000000000004s)]
*  better way? So Moreno, he's 100% wrong in abortion. He's done that with his own workers. He's against, [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3506.72s)]
*  not only just against the minimum wage, but he thinks the minimum wage should be eliminated. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3514.48s)]
*  And recently, as some of you have seen, I assume you've seen it, John, he was in a town hall and he [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3520.7999999999997s)]
*  said, why are these single issue voters in abortion? What's with them? Why should a woman [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3527.9199999999996s)]
*  over the age of 50 care about abortion? And that sort of tells you who he is. And it tells you, [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3532.64s)]
*  I mean, he mocked Ohioans and he particularly mocked women over 50. And I don't think they, [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3538.24s)]
*  as my wife, whom you know, wrote in her sub stack column, see it the polls, pal, [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3544.24s)]
*  because it's pretty clear. So, but Moreno's also a self funder. I ask people, [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3549.8399999999997s)]
*  because he's spending so much, because McConnell's spending so much in my race, this is [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3554.3199999999997s)]
*  probably the most expensive race now, most money spent against a candidate ever for the US Senate, [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3559.28s)]
*  $200 million, something like that. So I ask people to come to SherrodBrown.com and help me with 15 or [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3565.76s)]
*  $20 or whatever you can afford. So aside from your Senate race, Ohio has become part of the national [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3571.76s)]
*  political debate this year, thanks to your fellow Senator and current Trump running mate, JD Vance. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3578.6400000000003s)]
*  Both Vance and Trump are still spreading lies about the good people of Springfield, Ohio, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3583.6800000000003s)]
*  including hardworking taxpaying immigrants who were there legally. How has that whole controversy [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3589.52s)]
*  landed with folks in Ohio? Is that something that's come up in your race too? [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3596.6400000000003s)]
*  First of all, these Senate partners, if you will, it's kind of an arranged marriage. Vance didn't [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3600.96s)]
*  choose me and I sure as hell didn't choose him. I bet. But that's what we got. Springfield is a town [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3609.1200000000003s)]
*  of, it's a town a lot like where I grew up, Mansfield. It's a little larger, about 60,000 [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3614.48s)]
*  people. It's a city that's been hit really hard by globalization. All kinds of manufacturing jobs [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3620.4s)]
*  have been lost in that city and they were coming back and the business community brought in [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3626.48s)]
*  and politicians of both parties brought in a number of immigrants to work in these plants [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3633.92s)]
*  and then, lo and behold, political figures politicized it. I've worked with them on this [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3638.7200000000003s)]
*  issue for months, working with state government, working with federal government, getting help [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3645.36s)]
*  as more housing is needed, more public works generally, more schools to address this influx [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3651.2000000000003s)]
*  of people. I think they're getting back on their feet. I think they will. I think it's a [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3659.92s)]
*  prosperous town and beginning to be a prosperous town and I'm just hopeful that politicians [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3664.48s)]
*  stop injecting themselves in to create division just so they can win politically. I mean, [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3672.0s)]
*  you saw that on the immigration bill that was about to pass earlier this summer and it was [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3678.64s)]
*  agreed to. It was a pretty conservative bill. The border agents supported it yet for political [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3685.92s)]
*  reasons it got blown up and I'm hopeful after the election, after we have a pretty good year, [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3691.36s)]
*  we keep the Senate and the Kamala wins, we win the House. I'm hopeful we can actually do things [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3696.96s)]
*  and put this divisive for the sake of political victories and divisive politics behind us. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3703.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like one challenge is that, especially in the Trump era, you know, [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3710.8s)]
*  Republicans want to tell people that they're very legitimate concerns about cost of living, [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3715.28s)]
*  cost of housing, health care, you know, are the fault of immigrants, of people who don't [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3720.8s)]
*  who don't look like them. And, you know, and you and a lot of other Democrats are trying to say, [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3725.84s)]
*  look, there's, you know, corporations making record profits and CEOs making record profits and, [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3731.92s)]
*  you know, rich as ever. And we should look to them when we're trying to figure out how to [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3739.36s)]
*  help you with the cost of living. Like, how do you, how have you handled sort of the immigration [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3745.76s)]
*  issue when you've heard about it from voters in Ohio who are who might be frustrated? [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3749.52s)]
*  Yeah, immigration and they're running some really nasty ads on immigration on transgender against [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3753.84s)]
*  me to the tune of 50, $60 million of ads. And fact checkers have shown they're simply not true. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3759.6s)]
*  Independent fact checkers, not Democratic, Republican fact checkers. And, and they keep [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3768.24s)]
*  running the ads as you would expect them to because they only win when they divide people. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3772.72s)]
*  But when you I think when you talk about immigration and you talk about a couple of [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3776.8s)]
*  things and you talk about inflation and relate them together, pull them together, it's I talk [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3781.28s)]
*  about going to the grocery store after church and my wife and I and we see that and we hear in the [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3786.5600000000004s)]
*  checkout counter, we hear at the meat counter, checkout lane in the meat counter, people are [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3791.2000000000003s)]
*  complaining about prices. But they also understand that it's corporate, it's been corporate greed, [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3795.36s)]
*  the kind of buy stock buybacks that executives are taking the kind of [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3802.08s)]
*  the huge profits as you point out. I also though think that when it comes to immigration that [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3807.12s)]
*  why I went to the border with the Republican sheriff who has since endorsed me and he's a [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3813.92s)]
*  reasonable guy about these issues. And we when one of the things that we've worked on, especially [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3820.0s)]
*  Ohio, in Ohio about 350 people a month die from from fentanyl poisoning. I've been aggressively [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3826.72s)]
*  going after the through the going after the cartels. I've written a bill that's now law [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3834.72s)]
*  going after the cart sanctioning the cartels, sanctioning the precursor chemicals and China [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3839.68s)]
*  makers in China, and much of what we have to do in my state, especially about immigration is, [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3844.16s)]
*  is dealing with the drug issue that that I mean, it's all the above, it's scaling up treatment [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3850.8799999999997s)]
*  programs, it's giving border patrol the screening devices to look for this stuff that's smuggled in [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3856.0s)]
*  and most of it's smuggled across, mostly by Americans apparently, they told us. I mean, [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3863.44s)]
*  factually that's true and comes across at the border and legitimate traffic in the ports, [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3869.44s)]
*  in the points of entry. So we scale that up much better. We will in large part deal with this [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3876.4s)]
*  fentanyl poisoning problem. But it also, as I said, it's local treatment programs, too, for sure. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3883.2s)]
*  Jeff Goldberg over at the Atlantic just reported that Trump once said in an Oval Office meeting, [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3888.72s)]
*  I need the kind of generals that Hitler had. That's according to two sources in the meeting, [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3893.4399999999996s)]
*  his former chief of staff, John Kelly confirmed to Goldberg that he also heard Trump praise [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3898.56s)]
*  Hitler's generals. So I saw someone tweet, you know, is it too much for the Republican Party [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3903.3599999999997s)]
*  and the American people to care about this type of thing? What do you think? [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3908.48s)]
*  Of course, we should care about this kind of thing. I guess I step back for a second, John, [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3912.48s)]
*  and one of the things that's troubled me, I mean, that I'm still incredulous about, [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3917.04s)]
*  and it's hard to be incredulous about anything now, perhaps in American politics, but how I have a [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3922.56s)]
*  lot of Ukrainians in Ohio and they've, Ukrainians have historically been Republican because I've [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3928.64s)]
*  heard from many Ukrainians, a generation or two later, that they think FDR sold them out at [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3934.72s)]
*  Yalta and Truman sold them out at Potsdam. I mean, they think the Democrats have not been [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3940.64s)]
*  the anti-communist party enough and the Ukrainians are here as opponents to the Soviet Union, [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3945.12s)]
*  legitimately, and they have changed because they've seen what makes me incredulous is one [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3950.96s)]
*  of the political parties in this country is a pro-Russia party. That's the case for my opponent. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3957.2799999999997s)]
*  It's the case for the people my opponent associates with and that the Ukrainians feel adrift and now [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3961.92s)]
*  are much more supportive of our foreign policy because they know we don't, we don't, [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3970.08s)]
*  Democrats don't go to bed with dictators and our allies are Ukraine and Poland and Britain and [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3976.64s)]
*  Israel and France and democratic countries around the world, Japan, and people are pretty [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3982.7999999999997s)]
*  increasingly troubled by this, these, that the countries like Iran and Russia and China, [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3988.88s)]
*  and that some of our leaders are too close to them. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3995.2000000000003s)]
*  You were just endorsed by former Republican Governor Bob Taft, [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=3998.6400000000003s)]
*  the only person to ever beat you back in the 1990 Ohio Secretary of State election. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=4003.1200000000003s)]
*  Almost nobody knows that, but thank you for pointing that out. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=4007.44s)]
*  Otherwise, you got a perfect winning streak there. What does that endorsement mean to you [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=4010.4s)]
*  and what do you want it to mean to voters? Yeah, Bob Taft was a good public servant. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=4015.04s)]
*  He beat me in 1990 for Secretary of State and I've gotten along with him except during that [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=4019.92s)]
*  16 months or whatever that race, I wasn't like friendly, we weren't friendly then. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=4027.04s)]
*  Since he beat me within a few years, we began to see each other every once in a while. I've spoken [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=4032.0s)]
*  to his class. He's a long-time public servant. His family goes back actually before William Howard [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=4035.92s)]
*  Taft, the president, is his great-grandfather, but there was a Taft before him whose name I [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=4042.48s)]
*  forgot and it was like a judge or something. So it's a storied family in Ohio. His support [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=4047.52s)]
*  means a lot to a lot of people. He would be considered by some as kind of a rhino Republican, [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=4053.12s)]
*  but he's solid. People like him. They trust him. His support means a lot. I have heard many, [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=4059.7599999999998s)]
*  many Republicans tell me that they support me, including Republican officeholders. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=4065.36s)]
*  Most don't want to be public about it because they feel a bit threatened by their party if they do, [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=4070.56s)]
*  but I think Taft's support will go a long way to just tell Republicans, Brown's been effective. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=4076.48s)]
*  I've worked with people to get things done. I've worked with Republicans. When I need to, [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=4083.12s)]
*  to get stuff done, I come up with ideas from my meetings in your wife's hometown of Cincinnati [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=4088.56s)]
*  or Cleveland or wherever. Roy Blunt was a former senator, if you remember, from Missouri. I'd known [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=4094.96s)]
*  him for 30 years or so. He was talking to somebody once and he said, what do you think, [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=4102.8s)]
*  Sherrod Brown? He said, well, I've known him for 30 years and we've agreed exactly five times. He [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=4106.24s)]
*  laughs and then he said, but all five of those became federal law. The whole point is you find [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=4111.28s)]
*  people that you don't agree with or don't even necessarily like much. I liked Roy, but you then [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=4117.360000000001s)]
*  find a way to work with them because if you can build that coalition, it works. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=4123.6s)]
*  And so Taft knows I do that and that's what gets things done in my state and I will always continue [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=4126.64s)]
*  to do that. Two weeks to go, extremely close race. Some folks still making up their minds, [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=4133.200000000001s)]
*  either to whether to vote for you or whether to vote at all. What do you want them to know? [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=4140.400000000001s)]
*  What's the closing message in the last two weeks here? That I'll be on their side, that politics is [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=4145.120000000001s)]
*  not left to right in my mind. It's who side you on and that my opponent is 100% wrong in abortion [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=4150.64s)]
*  rights. My opponent is 100% wrong in minimum wage. My opponent took money from his employees, [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=4157.04s)]
*  $400,000 in back wages. And I'd ask people to come on board to go to sherrodbrown.com and contribute [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=4165.6s)]
*  $15 or $20 or volunteer or come to Ohio or make phone calls into Ohio in a close race, [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=4172.400000000001s)]
*  in a race where 12 million people live in my state and it's going down to the wire. So I [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=4178.4s)]
*  appreciate their joining us. Sherrod Brown, thank you as always and good luck in the final stretch. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=4183.12s)]
*  We'll do everything we can to and Emily also says hello. She wanted me to tell you hi. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=4189.04s)]
*  Tell Emily hi and tell the judge hello too and John, thank you so much for doing this. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7T_Dg5TxA0&t=4194.24s)]
