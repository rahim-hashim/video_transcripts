Video Description: After a surprise appearance on  Saturday Night Live, Kamala Harris closes on optimism, unity, and lower prices—while Trump fantasizes about reporters getting murdered and says he regrets leaving office after losing reelection. With just one day to go, Jon, Lovett, and Tommy sort through the latest from the trail and the final batch of high-quality polls, including a stunning result from Ann Selzer in Iowa showing Harris up three points in a deep-red state. Then, the guys reflect on what we've already  learned from the campaign—regardless of the outcome.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

*  Alright, let's talk about the candidates final weekend [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=541.62s)]
*  Kamala Harris clearly believes every swing state is still in play because she was everywhere from Georgia and North Carolina to Michigan over the weekend [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=543.72s)]
*  Today alone the campaign has a series of rallies and concerts in Atlanta Detroit Las Vegas, Milwaukee [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=551.0600000000001s)]

*  Which is always how you end a campaign. What a coalition. What a good list Cheney up there [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=564.2s)]
*  George W Bush's surprise guest George W Bush and Taylor Swift walk Joe looks like he lost a few you know [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=570.02s)]
*  No, I haven't seen him. I just want to give him some credit [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=576.8199999999999s)]
*  The big celeb cameo came this weekend from Kamala herself who made a surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live. Let's listen [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=579.74s)]
*  It is nice to see you Kamala and I'm just here to remind you you got this [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=588.74s)]
*  Because you can do something your opponent cannot do you can open doors [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=594.9399999999999s)]
*  Did they like to a garbage truck right Kamala take my pabla [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=606.3s)]
*  The American people want to stop the chaos and end the drama [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=614.4599999999999s)]
*  With a cool new step mama [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=620.9s)]
*  Keep backing up a job alas and watch a rom Kamala [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=623.9s)]
*  Like legally blonde Allah [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=629.42s)]
*  Because what do we always say keep Kamala and carry on a lot [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=632.18s)]
*  What you guys think about SNL, it's really funny it was good. It was well done [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=637.9s)]
*  I'm really gonna miss Dana Carvey as Joe Biden. That is just [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=641.8199999999999s)]
*  Hilarious. I didn't get to watch the entire skit until last night. We got home once again. He just nailed [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=645.38s)]
*  It's also pretty intense that he's that they did that Joe Biden bit in front of Kamala Harris who's sitting there in that chair [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=650.98s)]
*  Which I which I which was great. Yeah, it was good. I mean it like I appreciated that. It was like pretty on message [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=657.14s)]
*  You know it was uh, I know that Trump wants to shut down NBC and and put Lorne Michaels in prison for some sort of [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=663.12s)]
*  Lawbreaking related to this but it was it was a pretty good in kind contribution. I'll take it [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=670.0s)]
*  Well, you see they gave Trump they gave him NASCAR gave Trump the same amount of time during a NASCAR event a NASCAR race [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=673.5200000000001s)]
*  Yesterday. Yeah, it was definitely a high information skit [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=680.46s)]
*  You had to know about Trump's stupid garbage truck driving right press conference son [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=683.1s)]
*  Which by the way politico found some voters some Puerto Rican voters in Pennsylvania who saw that and actually thought it was a continuation [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=688.3199999999999s)]
*  Of the kill Tony joke that kicked this whole off calling Puerto Rico an island of garbage. So brilliant plan there [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=694.54s)]
*  I think I think it's that SNL is not not changing any minds [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=701.02s)]
*  But I do think it projects like confidence and optimism [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=704.84s)]
*  like in the final weekend and like she can hang and I got a [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=709.76s)]
*  Text from a friend who he was always gonna vote for Kamala, but there was a you know, like a month ago [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=713.88s)]
*  I was really trying to convince him that like she's she's good. She's a great candidate [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=719.2s)]
*  She's gonna win and he was like really down on it and he texted me after that. He was like, oh, she's gonna win now [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=722.98s)]
*  She's gonna win. That was amazing. I'm like, okay, well, let's not go too crazy [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=727.36s)]
*  But take it but I think it did give some people who were probably already on her side like alright [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=730.02s)]
*  Yeah, I mean look the message is like can't we we want to move on from this kind of politics and we want to just [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=734.24s)]
*  Go back to watching rom-coms and I'm thinking about it so much [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=739.3199999999999s)]
*  I think it appeals to a certain certain SNL watching who will be disappointed even if we win [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=741.36s)]
*  But I thought I thought it was good [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=748.24s)]
*  I saw that you know [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=749.68s)]
*  I think SNL is primarily consumed on YouTube these days and 9.3 million people had watched the opening skit. So pretty good. Yeah [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=750.4399999999999s)]
*  Harris pretty much stuck to the closing argument. She delivered in DC over the weekend the campaign also released [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=758.48s)]
*  two final two-minute ads [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=763.92s)]
*  One that shows Harris talking to people she's met on the campaign trail [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=765.76s)]
*  Promising to be a president for all Americans touting her economic plans [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=770.1800000000001s)]
*  They also have like big giant block letters on the screen take on price gouging [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=773.32s)]
*  Bring down the cost of groceries bring down the cost of prescriptions if that was the the pros version of the final ad [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=777.52s)]
*  There was a more poetry version that just came out right before we recorded that's sort of more sweeping. It's got the movie narrator voice [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=783.6800000000001s)]
*  It's doing freedom [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=790.94s)]
*  Hits Trump and Elon Musk ties them to ties Trump to billionaires and politicians doing the same old shit [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=792.44s)]
*  I like that one too [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=798.34s)]
*  Any thoughts on her overall final pitch in these last days either on either with the ads or on the stump? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=800.0400000000001s)]
*  My my honestly my overall reaction is that it's like there's nothing particularly new in the video and it's a testament to how just [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=805.6800000000001s)]
*  Exquisitely on message this campaign has been from the moment she became the candidate until these final days [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=812.6s)]
*  They are trying to hammer these key points that they think will bring along the last few [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=817.56s)]
*  Undecided on things like costs on common-sense solutions something that she said in her speech [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=822.0999999999999s)]
*  And that is in both of these ads clearly must be something that tests very well amongst a narrow sliver of voters [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=826.8399999999999s)]
*  they're trying to get to and [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=831.4399999999999s)]
*  I like the ad I book I'm a sucker for [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=833.5999999999999s)]
*  To this morning we rise kind of an ad works on me every time that's that'll that'll never change for me [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=837.56s)]
*  but overall it is just a reminder that like [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=843.0s)]
*  We're gonna talk about what we know [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=846.4399999999999s)]
*  Like what we've learned over the course of this campaign and we have learned a lot [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=848.68s)]
*  But I do think one thing we are going to find out on Wednesday is about the value of an incredibly effective [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=852.0s)]
*  campaign and a campaign that is on message trying to reach people and [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=858.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I will say at her rally on Sunday night. She didn't mention Trump's name once it was the first time and [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=863.88s)]
*  In the first ad doesn't really mention Trump Trump's barely mentioned in that second ad the freedom ad [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=871.56s)]
*  and [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=877.96s)]
*  I think that they've been like listening to her message the ads at the end of the week [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=879.16s)]
*  Tommy and I had this you know like friendly debate on the last pod about the fascism and the economic stuff [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=884.0s)]
*  The truth is they did it all you know at the end of the day they realized [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=890.36s)]
*  That you kind of you have to you have to raise the stakes of the election [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=895.04s)]
*  You have to remind people what they don't like about Trump you have to introduce her [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=898.68s)]
*  You have to make sure that she's defined in a way that she's acceptable to people and then you also have to talk about [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=902.28s)]
*  Her plans for those you know like I just I think they did it all they definitely did it all I mean [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=907.4s)]
*  I think the question the challenge in politics is measuring inputs versus outputs [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=911.16s)]
*  And you can obviously put all of that in the speech the question is what gets to people and it is kind of funny that [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=915.4399999999999s)]
*  There's two final two minute ads like usually you have one because you're making some choices [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=920.64s)]
*  It's keeping that as a billion dollars [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=924.4399999999999s)]
*  So much money, but I think they're great like I like I love the clips of her [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=926.5600000000001s)]
*  Talking with voters where she seems like a human being connected them. I like the policy stuff at the top [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=929.8800000000001s)]
*  I hate the narrative voice stuff, but whatever that's fine [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=934.12s)]
*  Who knows what like what voter is gonna see this ad that hasn't already seen a trillion ads [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=937.8800000000001s)]
*  We don't know but I did like usually these campaigns close on a positive message or these Democrats close positive close optimistically [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=944.44s)]
*  I noticed too that they proactively released to press that they had not mentioned Donald Trump in that event [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=952.6s)]
*  I don't know if that's undercut by then releasing an ad that very much does mention him as a clips of Elon Musk looking like [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=958.64s)]
*  A goober I'm guessing no one gives a shit [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=964.6s)]
*  But I like her like you know telling us that there is a different brand of politics that we can achieve on Tuesday [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=966.48s)]
*  I also think it's the decision to do [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=973.88s)]
*  Everything everywhere all at once is very reflective of the information environment [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=977.8399999999999s)]
*  We're in now and how there's just like huge segments of voters that they need to reach that aren't getting their news [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=982.76s)]
*  From the same place that aren't watching the same media [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=989.5999999999999s)]
*  And so it's like all right little little cost for this group of voters little [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=991.9599999999999s)]
*  freedom and abortion for this group of vote right like they kind of have to do it all and [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=997.24s)]
*  For us it seems because we are junkies who pay attention all the time [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1001.0s)]
*  It seems like it's all over the place [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1004.3199999999999s)]
*  But if you're one of these voters we talked to over the weekend you just happen to turn on the TV or look on YouTube [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1005.92s)]
*  Or wherever you get your news from hopefully you see the right the right message [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1011.72s)]
*  We feel that like you feel that you just you just feel this ad just like a pen an inch above the paper [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1015.36s)]
*  And they're just like trying to fucking drag the pen down [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1020.6s)]
*  Fucking thing I'm like just get on the fucking thing. I don't quite know what what? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1024.04s)]
*  That like it's a metaphor it's just like that that this is it this feels to me like ads aimed at people who are either [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1029.92s)]
*  Julia decided to vote [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1036.92s)]
*  But the people that are leaning towards Kamala that are open to Donald Trump [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1038.48s)]
*  And they're just trying to get people to just like that last little gap of like do my really gonna vote for this person [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1042.28s)]
*  It's what you were just saying about on the doors like the best thing about [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1047.24s)]
*  Talking to undecided voters is you don't have much time and you really do have to boil it down to just like what's your what? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1050.92s)]
*  What's the thing you're gonna say to them if you have five seconds? Yeah, right on the Republican side [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1057.16s)]

*  Don't mind this is a group of people large group of people larger than people think but it's a very [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1112.34s)]
*  Demonic party it said we had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left I [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1118.1399999999999s)]

*  Hates his prepared remarks so politica's headline about Trump's final weekend is [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1140.62s)]
*  Trump returns to his grievances for his closing argument the Washington Post went with [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1145.3799999999999s)]
*  GOP's closing election message on health baffles strategists worries experts and the New York Times story out of the Pennsylvania event called Trump quote [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1150.54s)]
*  Sluggish and aggrieved that was in the headline [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1159.3799999999999s)]
*  And the piece pointed out that Suzy Wiles who's running the Trump campaign appeared to be giving Trump the wrap it up sign at some [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1161.74s)]
*  Remarks I bet [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1169.14s)]
*  What do you guys think is going on with Trump in these final days? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1171.02s)]
*  And would anyone like to argue that any of it is strategic no chance [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1173.46s)]
*  I mean I walked by the TV this morning, and I heard him repeatedly mentioned Al Sharpton [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1177.1s)]
*  I was like what what happened here did Al Sharpton endorse Donald Trump no [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1180.3799999999999s)]
*  He was telling a long whiny story about Van Jones being mean to him, and I believe 2017. That's where we're at [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1183.44s)]
*  It's just like a grievance fest [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1189.7s)]
*  And I think we're like we don't know if he's gonna win or lose [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1191.42s)]
*  But there's just no question if he loses that part of it is because of this last since what is it October 27th? [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1193.7399999999998s)]
*  Was the Madison Square Garden? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1200.2199999999998s)]
*  Hatefest which was so terrible that even Megyn Kelly like a died-in-the-wool maga person now [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1202.3799999999999s)]
*  Was complaining about it, and he's talking about shooting reporters [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1208.1s)]
*  I mean the bulwark just had a piece out [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1210.6799999999998s)]
*  Where Trump came off stage after the event where he suggested that reporters might get shot? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1212.58s)]
*  And he knew he had screwed up. He knows that relitigating 2020 is bad [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1217.3799999999999s)]
*  So he seems just like an exhausted old man who is you know at the end of a process that would be brutal for someone [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1221.58s)]
*  Half his age, and I think he also takes cues from the audience [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1227.74s)]
*  And he wants to entertain them and he doesn't think his speech is entertaining [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1230.66s)]
*  You know he starts with our you better off than you were four years ago [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1233.82s)]
*  Then he's bored of that and by the end he's doing the weave for 96 minutes, and we're talking about you know [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1237.1000000000001s)]
*  Squirrels or something yeah, I mean like he jokes about [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1242.64s)]
*  Worth hearing about the amount of like kind of a performative laughter from the crowd when he jokes about reporters getting murdered [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1246.26s)]
*  you know we went through a new cycle of [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1252.7s)]
*  Actually, there's an explanation for his weird violent fantasy about murdering Liz Cheney right the chickenhawk. Yeah the [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1255.82s)]
*  SNL trying to call the journalists chickenhawks to yeah [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1264.14s)]
*  Yeah, the SNL part the people aren't talking about as part with where? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1266.8600000000001s)]
*  The Trump impression and actually really kind of capture something about Trump in the homestretch here [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1271.5s)]
*  Which he's like I don't want to keep doing this. I don't want to be up here anymore [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1275.82s)]
*  There is a like try to be with you people [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1278.86s)]
*  Donald Trump still wishes you were running against Joe Biden [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1281.7s)]
*  He I you can see in how he is right now that he is like [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1284.2s)]
*  Fundamentally like pissed off because if Joe Biden were the candidate he thinks he'd be walking away with this thing and now he's fighting [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1287.42s)]
*  It to a draw I am sure he is seeing the actual internal polling from the Trump campaign showing how fucking close it is [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1292.5s)]
*  it's infuriating to him and [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1298.18s)]
*  There's like just he's angry. He's angry and he's tired and when he's tired [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1301.26s)]
*  He can't help but be himself and it's kind of productive. I've heard some people [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1304.82s)]
*  surmise that [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1309.98s)]
*  Maybe all this RFK jr. Shit [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1311.54s)]
*  That's going on where he's like letting RFK jr. Out saying he's gonna run public health and Trump saying I'm gonna put him in charge [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1314.18s)]
*  Of women's health and Trump's appearing with him in Michigan and all this kind of stuff has to do with like maybe [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1320.78s)]
*  They're trying to like get some RFK jr. Curious voters on board with Trump [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1326.5s)]
*  Especially places where RFK jr. Couldn't take himself off the ballot like Michigan like Wisconsin like maybe but I also think [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1331.18s)]
*  Occam's razor here is just like Trump says whatever the fuck comes out of his would zone his mind [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1339.3000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and I don't know that RFK is the most loyal guy [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1344.18s)]
*  I mean, he's always been kind of a narcissist in it for himself [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1346.9s)]
*  But yes, you know Trump's out there getting questions about whether [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1349.1000000000001s)]
*  He would ban vaccines not get rid of vaccine mandates ban vaccines and you know [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1353.74s)]
*  We're not just talking about like mRNA vaccines or kovat, you know, RFK jr. Is someone who questions the polio vaccine measles [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1359.02s)]
*  I mean things that you know put humanity in a much better situation [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1366.1s)]
*  And by the way, Trump left it open when asked it open left it open [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1370.54s)]
*  Yeah, I mean again is you're making arguments to people in the last minute [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1374.7s)]
*  RFK junior also [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1379.58s)]
*  He decided to tweet like when Trump takes office in January. The first thing we'll do is remove fluoride from drinking water [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1381.02s)]
*  Like something that has helped people's dental health for decades now. Yeah [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1388.86s)]
*  That's what America is gonna go for the polls. They want more cavities [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1394.58s)]
*  Let's time for America's children to have more cavities. That's what everybody's out for right now [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1397.82s)]
*  I do like I think two things can be true, right? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1402.4199999999998s)]
*  I think he is hearing like hey, there's some the the low information RFK people still may be voting for RFK [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1404.6599999999999s)]
*  Let's try to get something in front of those people counting on the fact that in the last 72 or 48 hours of the election [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1409.28s)]
*  The fact that Donald Trump is suddenly promising to end all vaccine mandates and maybe take vaccines off the shelves [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1414.06s)]
*  It's not gonna reach the other kinds of people for whom that might be persuasive or at least a [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1419.5s)]
*  Another final proof point for how Donald Trump is unstable and dangerous [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1424.3s)]
*  Tim Alberta in the Atlantic has a long piece about sort of the Trump campaign towards the end and [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1428.3799999999999s)]
*  You know, he makes a good point that based on all the people he talked to close to Trump Trump [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1433.4199999999998s)]
*  Just doesn't like calm and normal and disciplined [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1438.02s)]
*  He doesn't trust it and he gets bored like time you say with his speech [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1440.6999999999998s)]
*  He also just gets bored with everything seeming normal and going well for him. He loves the chaos [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1444.06s)]
*  He he wants to trust his gut and say whatever the hell he wants and oh [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1448.54s)]
*  Exactly all the kind of qualities you want in a president. It's just a classic [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1453.4599999999998s)]
*  Look, look the man needs therapy you recreate the patterns you had in your child [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1457.4199999999998s)]
*  You makes you feel safe. You don't trust when things are going well Trump. We've been there. We've all been there [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1461.84s)]
*  Can work through that? I can't believe that Tim Alberta piece came out this weekend. Yeah [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1467.28s)]
*  I was on our floor on our flight. We're reading it on our flight to Arizona. Yeah [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1472.02s)]
*  But I do look I think he has closed horribly again [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1476.52s)]
*  He might win right because maybe a lot of the vote is already a lot of vote is already baked in and a lot of [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1479.32s)]
*  People have already decided and so maybe that's enough for Trump to win [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1485.4s)]
*  I just [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1488.0s)]
*  It is not it was not surprising to hear David Plouffe and General Malley-Dillon and folks on the Biden campaign saying that they are [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1489.16s)]
*  In the last week they won [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1495.0s)]
*  Undecided voters by double digits because I don't think Trump has done anything [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1496.92s)]
*  To convince people in this last week who weren't already inclined to vote for him [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1502.3600000000001s)]
*  Detroit Free Press front page split screen [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1507.3600000000001s)]
*  It says VP Harris voices optimism from for America in message to Michigan [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1510.44s)]
*  And then on the other side it says Trump campaigns and swing states says he shouldn't have left White House [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1515.72s)]
*  Like that's the front page the Michigan voters are waking up to that, you know [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1521.28s)]
*  All right. So this weekend we also got the final dump of polls in this race [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1525.92s)]
*  The last round of time Sienna swing state polls came out on Sunday morning. It's kind of a surprising mix [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1529.88s)]
*  They have Harris up three points in Nevada two points in North Carolina two points in Wisconsin one point in Georgia [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1535.92s)]
*  Tied in Pennsylvania and Michigan and down for in Arizona [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1542.24s)]
*  Nate Cohn wrote in his analysis that there's some evidence of late deciders breaking for Harris [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1546.0800000000002s)]
*  He has it at 16 points 58 to 42 [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1550.2600000000002s)]
*  the gap is much wider in the Sun Belt states and [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1553.1000000000001s)]
*  Then Trump leads by about the same margin among late deciders in the blue wall all in all it suggests that there's more movement in the Sun Belt [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1555.88s)]
*  And it's going towards Harris, but basically everything tied everywhere at least according to the times [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1563.68s)]
*  Their average now is one point or less in every battleground [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1569.3999999999999s)]
*  Except Arizona. I'm gonna stop and just talk about these polls. Yeah, let's do this first because that overall [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1572.84s)]
*  It's just another poll set of polls showing it's really really close and the fact that voters in the Sun Belt's are breaking towards Harris [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1577.52s)]
*  Comports with what David Plouffe was saying there is this one strange number out of these polls, which is that in the [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1584.28s)]
*  the northern swing states Trump led 60 to 40 among late deciders [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1591.9199999999998s)]
*  Which is in opposite of the three Sun Belt states and from what we've heard from the Harris campaign [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1596.1999999999998s)]
*  So it was just it was just strange and just one of those like well that data point makes a narrative really hard to form [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1601.6s)]
*  And that's all yeah, so that you know, it's all it's all tied up [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1607.28s)]
*  I do think one explanation for her doing better in the Sun Belt and then slightly worse in the northern battlegrounds is it's just [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1611.08s)]
*  the electorate is starting to return to form to the 2020 electorate a little bit and [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1618.32s)]
*  You know you saw this some you gov did had done a series of polls of black voters and [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1624.1200000000001s)]
*  Trump's share of the black vote has basically stayed the same over the last several months [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1630.5200000000002s)]
*  But Harris's has grown in the light in their final wave of polls [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1634.76s)]
*  And so you're starting to see in high quality polls that sort of focus on [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1639.16s)]
*  An entire demographic so that you don't get these like, you know [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1644.68s)]
*  Small samples you see the black vote starting to look more like it did in 2020 [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1648.1200000000001s)]
*  You see the Latino vote starting to look more like it did in 2020 the youth vote starting to look more, right? [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1652.3200000000002s)]
*  So you're seeing some reversion in some of these polls to like what the electorate was like in 2020 [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1656.48s)]
*  Which would make sense of why the Sun Belt is getting a little better for her and then it's getting a little tighter in the northern [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1661.3200000000002s)]
*  Battlegrounds. Yeah, I also the one of Nate Cohen pointed this out about late deciders that both of these things can't be true [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1666.6000000000001s)]
*  It can't be true that in the that in Pennsylvania according to the Times late breakers are going towards Trump and according to the Harris [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1672.68s)]
*  campaign they're going towards Harris just one of those things has to be true and the question is like [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1677.84s)]
*  What is the artifact of this polling that's pulling out that kind of information? [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1681.0s)]
*  It might just be that the like that that people saying that they are late deciders may have in a previous poll is what Nate [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1684.04s)]
*  Pointed out might have already have been saying they were voting for Harris had they been called a week or two earlier [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1689.52s)]
*  Yeah, there's a generally is the mixed bag [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1693.72s)]
*  I mean we want her to win in the Midwestern States first and foremost because that seems to be the most likely path [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1695.8s)]
*  But there was a surprisingly strong result out of Nevada that we hadn't seen in a while which seemed to cut against the doom and gloom [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1700.52s)]
*  We've seen from John Rawlson about the early vote. So again, we're just emotional basket cases. That's right [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1707.08s)]
*  Well, the poll heard around the world [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1713.76s)]
*  There we go dropped on Saturday night as the legendary and seltzer of the Des Moines Register came down from the mountaintop [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1716.08s)]
*  With a tablet that showed Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1722.4399999999998s)]
*  47 44 in the state of Iowa a state that Donald Trump won by eight points in 2020 and where seltzer's June poll of this year [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1727.4399999999998s)]
*  Had Trump leading Joe Biden by 18 points in 2020 seltzer's final poll [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1734.8s)]
*  Showing Trump up by seven was the first and only sign that the polls were underestimating Trump [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1741.9199999999998s)]
*  like they did in 2016 when seltzer's finally final poll showed him with a [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1748.4399999999998s)]
*  Seven point lead over Hillary Clinton. He ended up winning the state by nine that year [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1753.08s)]
*  That was a a terrifying moment for all of us in 2016 when we're like, oh, maybe this is not gonna go the way we think [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1757.48s)]
*  Ignore that yeah [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1764.6s)]
*  According to the poll the shocking result this time around is based on a surge towards Harris among older and independent women [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1766.6799999999998s)]
*  Trump of course called it a fake poll done by a Trump hater and a call with an NBC reporter [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1774.6399999999999s)]
*  He'd previously called it a really great poll [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1778.6799999999998s)]
*  The Harris campaign said on a briefing call quote. We are seeing that we're closing strong [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1781.52s)]
*  I would not read into it any more than that [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1785.9199999999998s)]
*  Point taken but let's do it. Anyway, Tommy. How should people be thinking about this poll? [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1789.1999999999998s)]
*  I mean, I think it's it's a shocking outlier [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1792.98s)]
*  But one from someone who's considered one of the best pollsters in the business if not the best [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1795.9s)]
*  I personally cannot overstate how large and seltzer loomed in my life because she basically called the Iowa caucuses in [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1800.22s)]
*  2008 or at least, you know [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1808.58s)]
*  She had Obama winning by basically the margin that he ultimately won by so, you know, you you explained how [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1810.34s)]
*  Seltzer got this result which was older voters independent women breaking for Kamala Harris oddly [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1815.7s)]
*  They also she has Harris winning senior men men over 65 by two points, which is just kind of like hard to fathom [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1822.98s)]
*  Seltzer says she doesn't know exactly how why this is happening [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1830.34s)]
*  She thinks it's because of Iowa's extremely draconian six-week abortion ban [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1834.22s)]
*  And the impact that is having the one thing that just we're knowing is is seltzer's [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1839.22s)]
*  Methodology is different from a lot of other pollsters because she basically just draws her sample by randomly calling [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1843.94s)]
*  Iowa phone numbers landlines and cell phones they contacted a thousand adults to get 808 Iowans [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1850.7s)]
*  They waited a little bit, but they're not doing all the kind of monkey business that a lot of other pollsters are doing where they are [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1856.54s)]
*  Basically asking respondents who they voted for in 2020 and waiting their sample that way so it looks like that electorate [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1863.4199999999998s)]
*  So, you know, it's a gutsy [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1868.98s)]
*  Poll to release because she knew you know, she says in an interview with Tim Miller. She did yesterday [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1871.58s)]
*  One day my methodology won't work and I'll explode and like spread into little pieces over Des Moines or something very funny like that [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1877.7s)]
*  But we'll see [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1884.7s)]
*  Yeah, I mean like my take away from the poll [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1887.22s)]
*  so first of there's another poll out of Kansas that showed Trump only winning by five and I bring it up only because [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1889.18s)]
*  These are polls that can't heard because no one else is pulling these states and those polls could actually end up becoming outliers [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1894.42s)]
*  And it turns out that the polls showing a tie or Trump ahead are correct and will say oh these were [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1900.3799999999999s)]
*  Outliers because maybe those voters were because of how she samples or because of the politics of those places slightly different [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1905.3s)]
*  but all in all it takes tells me like [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1912.26s)]
*  You know Nate Cohen wrote up about these not times sienna polls that basically if there's a polling error like 2020 [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1915.54s)]
*  It could turn out that Donald Trump could run the table if there's a polling error like 2022 could turn out that Harris runs [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1922.02s)]
*  the table and [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1927.72s)]
*  I think the truth is we just don't know because as Tommy pointed out a lot of these polls are being weighted [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1928.7s)]
*  Towards the 2020 sample which is just a way to kind of step kind of basically have them all heard towards a result that [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1934.18s)]
*  Kind of looks like 2020 with certain assumptions about how the electorate has changed baked in but that's not really a poll [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1941.3400000000001s)]
*  Right. That's something else. That's that's a model or that's yes. It's it's in it and [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1947.14s)]
*  like we will we will find out seltzer said this to Tim but [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1952.5s)]
*  her waiting [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1958.02s)]
*  That you know, she's defending her waiting right which is not weighted towards recalled vote or party even party ID or registration [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1959.74s)]
*  but it is by demographic and [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1966.86s)]
*  So she's getting enough of each kind of voter in Iowa and by region, right? [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1969.18s)]
*  So she's trying to get so she's trying to avoid the lights congressional district. Yeah, just getting a bunch of excited libs [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1974.32s)]
*  But who knows? I think there's just a signal in the poll [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1981.1200000000001s)]
*  I think that's the best you can say right which is that there is that Harris is holding up [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1985.24s)]
*  Surprisingly well, maybe among older [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1990.96s)]
*  Voters now, of course the poll said that Biden was doing really well with seniors and then he did typical [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=1994.0s)]
*  Performance with seniors he's a little bit better [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2001.0s)]
*  then then Hillary had but and and it's showing that women [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2003.16s)]
*  older women independent women are [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2009.4s)]
*  Really really motivated to go vote and that could have implications for Wisconsin that traditionally that has been [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2012.44s)]
*  What seltzer's poll has has told people and this was the case in 16 and 20 like oh well if Trump's doing that [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2020.3600000000001s)]
*  Well in Iowa then maybe Joe Biden or maybe Hillary Clinton aren't doing as well as we think according to the polls in Wisconsin [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2026.4s)]
*  Which ended up being true that those years? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2032.44s)]
*  But look it she could be wrong [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2034.96s)]
*  Of course her last miss her last big miss on the presidential level was in 2004 [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2037.32s)]
*  But even then she had Carrie up by three Bush ended up winning by 0.7 [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2041.9199999999998s)]
*  So that wasn't so like this type this is what she has in this result is an 11 point swing from the 2020 results [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2047.08s)]
*  Margin of error at the 95% confidence level is 9. Let's say that it's 9, right? Let's say she's off by 9 [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2053.56s)]
*  That's still Trump plus 6 in Iowa instead of Trump plus 8 would still be a shift to the left by 2 points [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2059.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, the the the the takeaway for me like stepping all the way back is okay [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2066.2s)]
*  Well, it seems like Anna suggesting there's an error in the polls that looks a bit more like 2022 that there is this [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2071.72s)]
*  this [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2077.2s)]
*  pro-choice [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2078.52s)]
*  Anti-Dobbs vote and then the question becomes okay. I was a place with a draconian abortion a lot [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2079.9199999999996s)]
*  Wisconsin's a state that just elected a Supreme Court judge to stop them from having a [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2086.0s)]
*  Draconian ancient abortion law in place, but it's a state where that was very much a fear you have Michigan where Gretchen Whitmer campaigned on protecting abortion access [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2093.16s)]
*  You have Pennsylvania where you have a Democratic governor that has been able to protect abortion access [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2100.4s)]
*  The question is what does that anti-Dobbs pro abortion coalition look like in states where? [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2105.44s)]
*  Abortion isn't as much under threat or in a state like Arizona where they have a ballot measure or a plate like Nevada where they have [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2112.56s)]
*  And I guess that's that to me is the open question for what it's worth Tim asked and seltzer about [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2118.16s)]
*  What this result could mean for Wisconsin? [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2123.96s)]
*  He's like cuz there's a lot of white people in both places and they eat at Culver's [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2126.6s)]
*  And she cautioned against that kind of analysis. I mean, I would just said she can't she's like I'm not qualified to know cuz I don't [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2129.48s)]
*  Yeah, she said the only way I would agree to do that is if I pulled that state [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2136.76s)]
*  But it's also just worth pointing out that Wisconsin is getting hundreds of millions of dollars worth of messaging every day [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2139.64s)]
*  There's field teams. There's people knocking doors [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2144.2s)]
*  I was got none of that because it's not a competitive state. So you're probably easier to reach people [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2145.84s)]
*  They're just not hearing the campaign messaging [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2150.44s)]
*  So it's just like it's a big like who knows but the hopeful version is definitely like, okay [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2152.52s)]
*  Maybe this is a signal that something good is happening out there another high quality [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2157.92s)]
*  highly rated pollster Marist [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2163.2000000000003s)]
*  Just came out with their final national poll [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2166.4s)]
*  5147 Harris they are the other big highly high quality pollster that does not wait by [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2169.04s)]
*  Education or pass vote so there's something there's there's some split there and you know, we'll find out [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2175.36s)]
*  Yeah, we will find out but I will say I just want to be on like even if the election results end up mirroring [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2182.72s)]
*  The kind of cascade of ties that will not mean that the their approach was the correct one [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2188.28s)]
*  It will just mean that they they herded [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2193.12s)]
*  Luckily correctly and we will run in in the next midterms and the next presidential the same confounding [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2195.8s)]
*  What do these mean? We will have no idea until the votes come in [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2201.12s)]
*  All right, we're getting to the end here. We said all along [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2203.8799999999997s)]
*  Rather be us than them you guys still feel like that's true [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2207.3999999999996s)]
*  I think so [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2210.08s)]
*  I would have had a different answer two weeks ago to be totally honest with you and now I feel [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2211.3999999999996s)]
*  Hopeful because Kamala Harris is closing strong. I think Trump has fumbled every bag [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2215.8799999999997s)]
*  He has been handed for 10 days now [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2221.04s)]
*  Yeah [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2223.68s)]
*  I would rather be us than them it wouldn't have changed for me over the last couple weeks even with the Evan flow because [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2224.2s)]
*  This the push to replace Joe Biden with Kamala Harris was just a bet on politics and we are practicing politics [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2229.5600000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump is doing something else and I still would rather bet on politics. Yeah, I [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2235.84s)]
*  Much rather be us. I mean, I think [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2240.6800000000003s)]
*  question is [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2243.6400000000003s)]
*  what are what are we talking about when people head into the voting booth and [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2245.1200000000003s)]
*  we are what the Trump campaign would want people to be thinking about when they head into the voting booth is [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2248.8s)]
*  Joe Biden [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2254.2000000000003s)]
*  Whether or not Pete you feel better off than four years ago inflation immigration squirrels, right? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2256.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, we're not talking about any of the things that we know the Trump campaign wants people to think about because it's in their ads [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2261.04s)]
*  And so now again, maybe people have already decided and so that doesn't matter [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2266.2s)]
*  but they are not doing that at the end and [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2271.8399999999997s)]
*  Trump's just saying crazy shit. He's being off as rocker [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2275.08s)]
*  He has anyone who's just tuning in right which are people who are not by definition [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2278.3199999999997s)]
*  Huge Trump fans are huge Kamala fans anyone who's just tuning into this whole thing [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2282.6s)]
*  Think of what they have seen in the last week from Donald Trump [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2286.92s)]
*  And because it's moving like well, sometimes that works with people [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2290.72s)]
*  Yeah, that works with his base but not people who are just doing it [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2293.48s)]
*  so and I think fundamentally if you're zooming out like [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2295.48s)]
*  She her coalition is relying on more reliable voters [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2299.52s)]
*  Than his right and now his base is certainly reliable that turn out in the rural areas already early voters like through the roof [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2304.84s)]
*  but [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2311.74s)]
*  he's betting on low propensity men to save the day for him and [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2312.98s)]
*  It could pay off but it's a it's a riskier bet. Yeah, sorry me even cells [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2318.42s)]
*  I just think about like I will for me like the last week and a half has truly to me been about [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2322.02s)]
*  Trump on Joe Rogan versus Michelle Obama and I just think like Michelle Obama made a case not just to people who are gonna vote for [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2326.98s)]
*  Harris but for the people [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2333.58s)]
*  Around those people right like for them to go to their husbands to go to their brothers and their sisters and to say please come [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2335.26s)]
*  With me. I don't do Donald Trump has not given a message to his MAGA base or on that show that says I know you're with me [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2340.18s)]
*  Here's how to go get some other people. He just has not done. Yeah [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2347.2999999999997s)]
*  All right before we sign off for the last time before results come in [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2350.3399999999997s)]
*  While we're all in agonizing suspense [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2354.02s)]
*  We thought it'd be a good time to talk about what we've learned from this race and any takes we feel confident about [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2356.02s)]
*  Regardless of what happens on Tuesday. I [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2361.54s)]
*  Get I'll run through a couple quick and you [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2364.3799999999997s)]
*  Pulling is broken. I hit that one [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2367.3399999999997s)]
*  Candidates matter switching from Biden to Kamala is why we have a chance. She is she has been an extraordinary candidate [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2370.1400000000003s)]
*  She took on the mantle and she deserves so much praise for them [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2375.6600000000003s)]
*  No matter what happens and I am sure there will be plenty of recriminations if we were to lose [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2378.6200000000003s)]
*  And I just want to be on record saying that because I would like to not be a part of that [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2382.38s)]
*  There'll be not a perfect campaign [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2387.1400000000003s)]
*  But if it required a perfect campaign to defeat this fucking moron then America's got bigger fish to fry [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2388.9s)]
*  Campaigns matter. She ran a great campaign [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2394.38s)]
*  The bigger points to me are the full takeover the Republican Party by Trump is [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2397.2200000000003s)]
*  Complete and and I don't know what comes next for Republicans if Donald Trump loses [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2401.2200000000003s)]
*  But we cannot forget what these people fucking did every single one who capitulated every single one who sold their souls for him [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2404.98s)]
*  They're not walking away from that. We will remember [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2411.1600000000003s)]
*  the last piece to is [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2414.38s)]
*  Because we got our got because Kamala became the candidate late because of a lot of headwinds [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2417.6600000000003s)]
*  Around people being frustrated by the cost of living an anti-incumbency [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2422.98s)]
*  Trend that is global [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2427.8599999999997s)]
*  It may not manifest in this election, but there is and there's not just an anti-Trump coalition out there [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2429.7799999999997s)]
*  There is a pro-freedom pro-democracy [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2435.38s)]
*  economically populist coalition out there that we can assemble we see that with Dan Osborne and the success he's had we see that with [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2438.54s)]
*  ballot measures across the country [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2445.54s)]
*  That movement that majority is there for us win or lose [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2447.7s)]
*  Yeah, I think I totally agree that candidates matter a lot. I think that if if this were Biden versus Trump [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2452.5s)]
*  We would be on a path to you know, Trump getting 400 electoral votes or more and it would be very very bad [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2460.2200000000003s)]
*  The good news there is there'd be less anxiety [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2467.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah more applying for passports [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2472.6200000000003s)]
*  I think also we learned that abortion is not a secondary issue for people [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2475.1800000000003s)]
*  A quote-unquote social issue or one that declined in salience as we got further from Dobbs [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2479.3s)]
*  It's an issue where the results of the Dobbs decision became more and more prevalent [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2484.42s)]
*  And the stories became more personal and horrifying and I think that drove voters [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2490.6200000000003s)]
*  There's been a lot of polling where you see an abortion tick up over the last few weeks in terms of its relevance [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2495.5s)]
*  I also think like there there was a very annoying [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2500.6600000000003s)]
*  Kind of internet Twitter meme for a while when Trump would say something and people be like lol [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2504.78s)]
*  Nothing matters, you know, I remember that and like sometimes that's true [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2509.26s)]
*  You know when you're in the kind of dregs of an off year [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2512.86s)]
*  He can say something most people won't see it. It won't matter [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2516.3s)]
*  And I also think that ultimately look the fact that we're here suggests that January 6 wasn't the career ending [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2519.38s)]
*  event like it should have been but [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2526.62s)]
*  What he says and does matters on the margins. I mean the Madison Square Garden [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2529.42s)]
*  Valley has hung with him. Yeah, it was a Univision poll of Pennsylvania Latino voters that found a lot of people [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2533.62s)]
*  Personally offended by that joke the kill Tony joke about Puerto Rico [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2541.74s)]
*  71% of respondents said the joke suggested there was racism in the Trump campaign and [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2546.78s)]
*  53% think Trump is very disrespectful to Latinos. So racism in the Trump campaign [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2552.22s)]
*  Yeah, Nick Fuentes. Yeah, I mean like the flip side to Joe Biden would be down to Trump [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2557.78s)]
*  We don't know what it would be like right now if they had run a normal public in the Nikki Haley versus Biden [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2563.1s)]
*  But like Nikki Haley versus Kamala Harris [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2567.46s)]
*  Like we don't know what it would look like that they had all the trends of anti-incumbency all the anger at the economy all the [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2568.8999999999996s)]
*  All the anger at the Biden administration behind a normal candidate running a strategic campaign [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2574.44s)]
*  I don't think we'd be pretty happy sitting here either. Yeah, the divided country anything could happen sucks that we got here but [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2579.2599999999998s)]
*  Feeling better if she loses I think the explanation to me feels pretty straightforward [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2586.66s)]
*  Which is that voters who don't follow news closely who don't show up in every election [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2591.7s)]
*  We're still pissed about high prices and or at the border [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2596.98s)]
*  which is sort of the post pandemic malaise that has as you said love it just taken down incumbents all over the world and [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2601.56s)]
*  Trading our very unpopular incumbent for his vice president 90 days out from the election [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2610.16s)]
*  Still wasn't quite enough to overcome that environment [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2616.54s)]
*  That was that I think if she loses that to me is the most likely explanation if she wins [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2619.2799999999997s)]
*  It is because the anti-maga coalition that has turned out in every election since 16 [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2623.94s)]
*  To beat Donald Trump and beat MAGA politicians did it again and it was fueled by [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2630.8599999999997s)]
*  women [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2636.22s)]
*  Who were pissed about? [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2637.94s)]
*  Dobbs and people an anti-maga coalition very pissed about [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2640.18s)]
*  Donald Trump's threat to democracy and what Kamala Harris did which would be an [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2644.98s)]
*  Incredible like history-making achievement is in 90 days [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2650.5s)]
*  She reminded people of what's at stake and also defined herself in a way where she [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2655.1s)]
*  neutralized Donald Trump's advantage on the economy and on immigration just enough to make sure that that [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2661.3s)]
*  Anti-maga coalition could propel her to the White House [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2667.7s)]
*  and [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2670.82s)]
*  It's sort of why I'm like relatively calm because I feel like we have done all we can yeah to make sure everyone who's paying [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1h4X0j0Nc&t=2672.06s)]
