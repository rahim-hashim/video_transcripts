Video Description: Bill Maher, the revered—and often reviled—political commentator, comedian, and host of the Club Random podcast and Real Time with Bill Maher, goes head to head with Lovett over wokeism, government fraud, and trans rights. A self-described liberal, Maher’s been hating on Democrats since before Joe Biden made it cool. He and Lovett debate whether Democrats have changed too much, the discourse around Israel and Gaza, and who should have a say over gender-affirming care. Is Maher peddling the right's propaganda, or is this the tough love Democrats need to face Trump 2.0?

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Bill Maher on Hating Donald Trump, The Far Left and 69ing
**Pod Save America:** [February 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk)
*  Welcome to Pond Save America. I'm John Lovett. We're up and running with our Sunday shows [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=0.0s)]
*  These episodes are going to be coming out every other weekend [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3.92s)]
*  We'll give John Tommy Dan and me a chance to have deeper conversations with a range of interesting people [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=6.48s)]
*  My guest this week is television host political commentator and stand-up comedian Bill Maher [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=12.56s)]
*  Welcome Bill [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=16.88s)]
*  That's the audience cheering. Oh, yeah, that's the huge. Yeah, what do you do if you have a guest who has no arms? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=19.12s)]
*  Uh, well we have we do have how do you how did that? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=25.6s)]
*  Oh, then you just put it on a boom mic. Could I get that you want the boom? No, i'm kidding. I'm just fucking with you [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  No, it's an important question honestly, that's why you're here [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=36.56s)]
*  No one's ever asked us that question before after an hour. Doesn't your arm get tired of holding the mic? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=38.56s)]
*  I shouldn't say that i'm going to stand up committee in my whole life. All I do is stand on stage [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=42.72s)]
*  You hold the mic you can switch hands, but it's different when you stand. You don't hold the microphone. Yeah, I do [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=46.72s)]
*  Um, so i'm sorry. You got this. Go ahead. Ask me your hard-hitting questions. I'll stop interrupting [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=51.2s)]
*  I started. Uh, all right. Welcome to you. Okay, that's done. Uh, okay. Uh, we like to start each episode with a land acknowledgement [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  We are on the land once occupied by jeffrey katzenberg and quibi. That's funny. I did I just did a special [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  on hbo and uh [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=70.08s)]
*  I did a whole thing about land acknowledgement and I mean it is just the epitome of [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=72.48s)]
*  and I see that uh [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=77.84s)]
*  At the recent dnc [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=80.16s)]
*  meeting [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=82.48s)]
*  They still did it like talk about not getting [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=83.68s)]
*  Not getting it after the election laws [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=87.28s)]
*  Yeah, I thought you might not like a land acknowledgement [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  No, I mean they still actually did it for real. Well, you know teach your own [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=93.28s)]
*  Yeah, I mean keep going down that road and you know, see where it leads you but you know, it's just people are not [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  Politically savvy. I don't feel in america, but they have [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=105.10000000000001s)]
*  They they know when you're full of shit [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=108.64000000000001s)]
*  and it's like, you know [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=111.12s)]
*  Land acknowledgement either give it back or shut the fuck up. Yeah, I think is what most people are thinking [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=113.2s)]
*  Yeah, I thought I might touch you off [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=119.44s)]
*  It seems like it worked. All right. So now I wanted to start with this because I just realized that [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=121.76s)]
*  Politically incorrect is about to be 30 years old more [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  Because it started in 93 [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=132.72s)]
*  And I think we're in 25. It's our 93. Yeah. Well, I remember watching it [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=135.68s)]
*  I would it was it was on comedy central then it moved to abc, correct [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=142.08s)]
*  But I could only watch it because comedy central read it re-aired it in the afternoons [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=144.96s)]
*  I didn't know that and so I would it's the it has to be true [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=150.96s)]
*  But I would come home from school. Wow, and I would watch it every day when I got home from school [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=155.04s)]
*  Well, I did it for the kids. It felt like that. It felt like that. I mean some nights it did [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=159.28s)]
*  Some nights it was just so ridiculous. Well [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=164.88s)]
*  It was very I was I actually was thinking about it was very formative for me and I went back [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=167.92s)]
*  And I watched the first episode of politically incorrect the very first episode who was on uh, jerry seinfeld, right? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  and jerry you you ask you ask jerry seinfeld, uh about [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=180.64s)]
*  a question about uh, whether or not [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=185.68s)]
*  Pedophiles should have to have signs on their lawns and it gives you this look like i'm here as a fucking favor [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=189.01999999999998s)]
*  I do jokes about cornflakes. What are you doing to me? That's hysterical. I don't remember. I remember jerry, of course such a great friend forever [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=194.16s)]
*  Great guy never changed. Um [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=202.48s)]
*  Absolutely, and he was at you know, the his show was doing great. So it was it was a great favor [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=205.18s)]
*  um [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=211.2s)]
*  And uh, I don't remember the question about them, but we didn't ask questions. We we presented topics on that old show [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=212.24s)]
*  uh every question [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=220.56s)]
*  I wrote the first season I had wrote them all myself word for word [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=222.8s)]
*  Did we even have writers? I think we had a couple but we had like this is before the people look shit up on the internet like we [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=227.76s)]
*  Had researchers, you know who had to like go to the stacks or something [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=234.4s)]
*  I don't know. It seems like it was from the middle ages, but we would just I would present a provocative [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=238.72s)]
*  Not saying things that I didn't believe or think should be discussed. I wasn't just doing it for the sake [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=245.36s)]
*  Uh, but and it would always end with does anybody have a problem with that? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=251.76s)]
*  That was the end when we put out a book from the show [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=257.03999999999996s)]
*  It was called, you know the best of politically incorrect. Does anybody have a problem with that? So like a [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=259.59999999999997s)]
*  pedophile [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=265.5s)]
*  Stand on what was it? They should put a sign in their lawn something to that effect [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=266.96s)]
*  I mean don't they kind of do that anyway now? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=271.44s)]
*  I mean it isn't don't you have to register? I think that's what this was about [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=273.68s)]
*  It was about registering and people being it was about public shaming and who should be shamed and who shouldn't be shamed [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=276.88s)]
*  It's very 90s john. Isn't it so fucking quaint [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=281.36s)]
*  that we [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=285.2s)]
*  Lived in an era where that was the kind of problem [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=286.8s)]
*  As opposed to the things the shit show that's going on now and things that are so much more [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=290.56s)]
*  Existential shall we say yeah, it isn't an issue. But come on. No, there was there was something about it [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=295.74s)]
*  And that's why I wanted to get to it [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=300.8s)]
*  And we'll get to it because [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=303.44s)]
*  Seinfeld is like what the fuck am I doing here? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  And and like and then ed rollins who was perosed can't roll it [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=308.72s)]
*  He was on it was yes. Yes, and it really like put me like put me back into a different time [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=313.92s)]
*  But there is one moment where Seinfeld lights up because it was about uh, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=319.44s)]
*  Polling and focus grouping and how whether it was valuable or not valuable and suddenly there really was an interesting moment [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=323.6s)]
*  Between there was many interesting moments. What sort of backhanded uncompliment is that? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=330.08000000000004s)]
*  Unbelievable take a compliment i'm saying i'm watching the episode and all of a sudden the pilot you suddenly see the magic that you [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=336.64000000000004s)]
*  Were trying to get in this show. I wasn't saying it was the only moment i'm saying there was a moment amongst several [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=343.12s)]
*  Okay [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=349.76000000000005s)]
*  Are you okay? Not really, but okay fine. I don't care [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=350.88s)]
*  Where all of a sudden you have ed rollins and you have jerry seinfeld talking about what they both know about which is [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  Polling and focus grouping and where it works and where it doesn't work and I was trying to [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=359.12s)]
*  What I was wondering is what you were trying to get out of having [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=364.32s)]
*  Comedians and celebrities sitting across from politicians and experts. I I always described it as a [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=368.78000000000003s)]
*  designed train wreck [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=376.94s)]
*  That's why it was funny [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=378.8s)]
*  And as you say sometimes there was great enlightenment from that the idea was everyone in america votes [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=380.56s)]
*  We all get to vote [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=387.12s)]
*  Whether we're harvard educated [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=388.72s)]
*  Although a few people are that stupid [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=391.52000000000004s)]
*  Or uh, you know the lowliest, uh mechanic who's [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=394.88s)]
*  Only finished eighth grade or something. We all get to vote [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=400.16s)]
*  We don't all know the same thing or come from the same background, but this is a democracy and let's [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=403.2s)]
*  pair [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=409.36s)]
*  The least likely people to ever be in the same room together at the same cocktail party [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=410.48s)]
*  And uh have them talk and yeah [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=416.32s)]
*  What was great about that show was that when it was good like you said there were moments that were really good [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=419.52s)]
*  But even when it was bad, it was like the bad was kind of good. It's uncomfortable. It's interesting [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=424.47999999999996s)]
*  I really well, I really did watch it every day when I got home from school [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=429.2s)]
*  Yeah, and I mean some nights it was so awful. It was like you had to you reveled in the awfulness [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=432.96s)]
*  the but there was you know, you talk about how things have changed and I want to talk about how [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=439.44s)]
*  The media has changed and also how the parties have changed but in terms of the media there was an episode [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=443.59999999999997s)]
*  Where it's really interesting you brought on sarah silverman and you brought on this [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=448.64s)]
*  What no i'm just the I mean, I love sarah and she's still a friend [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=454.4s)]

*  From the past and uh, I don't remember her on on that show. I remember her on real time [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=461.03999999999996s)]
*  But but she was on she was on well what was really interesting must have been really young [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=466.71999999999997s)]
*  Uh, she was and it was and you brought her on and an activist he was [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=471.04s)]
*  Uh an asian-american activist who was angry about a joke. She told that used the word chink [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=476.16s)]
*  I think that was real time. I don't think that was no, it was politically incorrect. Okay, i'm sure of it and [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=481.52000000000004s)]

*  You you it was really important to you [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=488.32s)]
*  You know, they'd both been criticizing each other in public and gone back and forth [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=490.8s)]
*  Well, can I give you a little of the history sarah made a joke? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=494.16s)]
*  Mm-hmm [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=496.88s)]
*  You know look it was a different era. I think she has since [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=498.08s)]
*  Mia culpiled about that [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=501.84000000000003s)]
*  Uh, she's gone back on a lot of stuff, you know, she she says [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=504.24s)]
*  She she went more toward like oh, no, I shouldn't have said that as opposed to some comics who were like [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=508.8s)]
*  We've gotten too sensitive. That would be me right? Yeah, clearly [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=514.8s)]
*  Yeah, no, I get that. Yeah, and we have right and i'm right about that. Okay, but that's easy [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=519.2s)]
*  You know, all right, but you know, she everybody has their truth [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=523.68s)]
*  Uh most probably she have thought about it like just take it in the most generous sense [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=527.76s)]
*  She thought about it and evolved on it. Even if we wouldn't do it today [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=532.8s)]
*  Do we have to go back and dig up the past and yell at ourselves when? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=536.88s)]
*  Here's the thing like whatever it was back then like [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=541.68s)]
*  Most people were okay with it. It wasn't mean-spirited. She got in trouble also once for a sketch [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=545.12s)]
*  She did which was an anti-racist sketch [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=551.0400000000001s)]
*  Okay, but we sort of glossed over nuance at a certain point and so [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=554.96s)]
*  You know, I don't know if it was necessary to be like i'm i'm history's greatest monster because I did this like no [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=560.8000000000001s)]
*  I thought I was doing the right thing and at the time [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=566.64s)]
*  Usually nobody else said anything. So it was obvious. That's where the country was anyway [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=569.76s)]
*  She did a joke with some sort of asian [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=574.8000000000001s)]
*  Reference, I don't remember what it was and the person from the [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=578.16s)]
*  asian [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=582.24s)]
*  You know media organization that was critical of the way asian people were portrayed, right? Correct [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=583.76s)]
*  Uh, he objected and so I guess I had them on to hash it out [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=588.32s)]
*  Yes, and and look I I think people evolve [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=591.84s)]
*  I like you know [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=594.5600000000001s)]
*  They went back and like stopped airing certain episodes of the golden girls and cut things out of certain shows [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=595.44s)]
*  And I think that's ridiculous, right? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=599.76s)]
*  Because this let's just this was the past and it was different even though shows are look modern [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=600.88s)]
*  And maybe and we should be able to see those things that's obvious, but but but I wanted to golden girls [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=605.9200000000001s)]
*  There there was a pretty racist episode the golden girls, but let's just there was but I think let people see it [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=610.48s)]
*  Who cares? I'm not i'm not talking about this specific episode for sure [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=615.0400000000001s)]
*  And like when they're like putting warnings on gone with the wind it's like gone with the wind sucks [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=618.96s)]
*  But not because it's racist. It is racist. That's not why it's awesome. It doesn't suck [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=622.88s)]
*  Okay, but we'll get back to it. We'll get back to gone with the wind [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=627.2s)]
*  We'll talk about movies at the end. I'm just let's let's challenge our assumptions [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=629.6s)]
*  But the the the reason I bring up the sarah silverman [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=632.72s)]
*  Moment who I love and think is an incredible comedian and she's sharp in that debate as well [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=636.08s)]
*  Is it was really important in that moment where you said you know what? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=641.0400000000001s)]
*  Let's have the debate right here and have it in front of everybody and let people hash it out [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=644.4s)]
*  and and you talk about how things are different and what's striking is like you think about that moment and [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=649.44s)]
*  There wasn't public forums for people to have debates [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=654.88s)]
*  Uh, there was television there was radio and television some you know newspaper op-eds people could write a letter to the editor [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=658.96s)]
*  but for the most part [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=664.4000000000001s)]
*  Political conversations on television weren't [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=666.24s)]
*  About or next to the political culture [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=669.2s)]
*  They were the political culture and if you got people together and had the debate it would the the 1000 people [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=671.2s)]
*  That got to have an opinion on television would see it and it would impact them, right? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=677.44s)]
*  And there was a you could you could really feel the impact of debate and we don't live in that world anymore [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=681.12s)]
*  It's a very different world. We do on my show. Well, that's I love doing that [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=686.32s)]
*  I mean and and you're right most shows don't do that. I mean you don't see much debate [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=690.72s)]
*  On cable news. I mean cnn has a panel [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=695.36s)]
*  But you know, I've that guy who I what did I call him lonely scott the one [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=700.6400000000001s)]
*  Lonely scott what is his name? Yeah [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=705.9200000000001s)]
*  Anyway lonely scott jennings. Yes. Yes scott jennings [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=708.32s)]
*  It's like six people and then after like they all [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=711.0400000000001s)]
*  Whatever they're gonna say and usually I agree with those people then lonely scott gets to talk [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=714.32s)]
*  But you know, I do like having a an actual debate. I mean [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=719.12s)]
*  This idea that they have [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=724.5600000000001s)]
*  Some people that you shouldn't platform [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=727.0400000000001s)]
*  You know, I mean I i've lost [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=730.08s)]
*  fans certainly and even like people who were friends kind of [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=733.0400000000001s)]
*  Because they were so mad at me that I had on real time people like ted cruise and bill bar [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=737.4399999999999s)]
*  Okay, he was the attorney general [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=744.64s)]
*  You know, i'm not going to talk to this man. Yeah [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=747.1999999999999s)]
*  We we've talked about that here and I think the early years of this [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=751.1999999999999s)]
*  Company we were much more reluctant in part because we were trying to [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=754.9599999999999s)]
*  I think be it just a platform for progressive voices. But as we've grown we realized that we want to have more [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=760.0s)]
*  conservative voices on to challenge them [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=765.76s)]
*  Because we want to be at the center and maybe be challenged and maybe and of course be challenged and of course be challenged [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=769.12s)]
*  But the reason i'm not one of them, you know, they think the the far left thinks I am [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=774.24s)]
*  I i'm I i put out a book and a stand-up special in the last six months both to make the point [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=779.52s)]
*  And in great detail [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=786.64s)]
*  You've changed not me. Yeah, I want to come back to that in a second. I want to stay on debate [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=788.72s)]
*  only because [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=794.48s)]
*  What I felt when I was watching those old episodes [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=796.08s)]
*  is a kind of nostalgia for [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=799.68s)]
*  A culture where debate mattered like you still do the kinds of debates you did back down [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=802.64s)]
*  They do with more kind of serious people as fewer correct. That's the difference popping up [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=807.04s)]
*  It's not carrot top with bomb door. Well, there was another [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=812.08s)]
*  On that episode where sarah silverman and this uh, uh activist are talking [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=815.28s)]
*  At what point I forgot he was even there david spade was sitting there in fucking silence [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=819.6800000000001s)]
*  And you turn to david spade and you're like, so david spade, what do you think? He's like, fuck you bill. How about that? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=824.0s)]
*  I don't want to be here. What am I doing here? I'm in tommy boy. Why are you asking me this really hard question? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=829.44s)]
*  Uh, that's always what was so I mean you said seinfeld basically had the same reaction like what am I doing here? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=834.08s)]
*  Yeah, but you know when you drag people out of their comfort zone [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=841.84s)]
*  It does produce a kind of real television that [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=846.4s)]
*  Unfortunately, yeah, you don't you don't get a lot and of course, you know, it's not everybody's cup of tea [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=850.46s)]
*  Yeah, it used to exist more in [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=856.3199999999999s)]
*  Uh, like the old [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=858.3199999999999s)]
*  before they went [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=860.08s)]
*  Uh live to tape when like carson was truly live and there were just things would go wrong, right? There'd be no carson was not live [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=861.28s)]
*  When there would be like moments early on in the early years and there'd be yeah, you got you got like [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=869.52s)]
*  Uh, uh, just like drunks on the stage [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=874.8s)]
*  And he's like I gotta get out of here drunks. I don't know if you remember the cheers finale [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=878.0s)]
*  I'm, not sure what year that would be cheers, but I remember that when they were all just [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=883.6800000000001s)]
*  Blitzed blitz to the gills good stuff. Uh, this is leno hosting and they were you know [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=888.0600000000001s)]
*  Just falling all each other over each other on the couch drooling and laughing and I mean poor j [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=894.08s)]
*  Was like he was not in on the private jokes between this cast [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=899.92s)]
*  Who were in an emotional state after doing this groundbreaking show for 10 years or whatever it was [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=903.52s)]
*  And now they had their finale and then they had their party and now they're on with j [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=908.9599999999999s)]
*  And they were drunk. So I think I think they they talked later about how the mistake was there there wasn't a meal [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=913.8399999999999s)]
*  There needed to be food. Yeah, I mean they were young and drunk and it's funny drunk is funny [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=919.1999999999999s)]
*  Drunk is funny. Yeah, but no, but it's not of course it can be sad, but we don't have to always just dwell on the sad [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=925.36s)]
*  Dean martin was funny. Yeah, and he wasn't even really drunk a lot of the times. He was really drunk [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=932.16s)]
*  There was no I don't think he was I think he I think that was a big myth [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=937.44s)]
*  You think yes? I thought he uh [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=942.16s)]
*  Yes, I think that was an act he dean was like he played golf and then he was in bed at nine [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=945.36s)]
*  He was that guy maybe when he was younger, I don't know frank was a big drinker. Yeah, there was a [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=951.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the uh, I sometimes think that like the reason there's such a focus on cancel culture [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=958.0799999999999s)]
*  Is because it used to be more fun to be a celebrity [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=963.1999999999999s)]
*  Like you could drive your car through a plate glass window and like tip somebody 500 bucks and nobody heard about it [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=965.76s)]
*  Yeah, frank and ava shot up palm springs once and it was just like just under the rug [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=970.24s)]
*  Well, I mean there's people do things today. I mean kanya come on. Well, he's not exactly we know about it [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=974.88s)]
*  I know but like he wasn't canceled for it [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=981.1999999999999s)]
*  He did he said hitler was I love hitler and nobody pulled his super bowl ad like three days later [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=983.76s)]
*  So it seems like you think cancel culture is needed [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=991.76s)]
*  I'm just saying some people get away with shit that other people don't it's very uneven [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=994.4s)]
*  This show is sponsored by better help. What are some relationship green flags? Those are [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=1000.0s)]

*  I found out when I got there, you know, of course, I never got married. So that's a big difference, you know, you become like [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=1463.92s)]

*  Uh, um, are you serious about that or take a political answer or a human answer? [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=1808.64s)]
*  Well, this I'm not gonna get very specific about this because this is like personal life stuff and I like to keep that [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=1813.3600000000001s)]

*  either [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=1841.1200000000001s)]

*  Happy to happy to leave that vague [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=1851.1200000000001s)]
*  We got all we got we got a lot of 69 talk earlier and there's nothing wrong with that and there's nothing wrong [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=1853.28s)]

*  Oh my god, that's the greatest thing in the world [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=1863.36s)]
*  Because we all should just be who we are right. I was born that way. Remember when that was [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=1865.84s)]
*  Yeah, this is how I was born. That's how I was drawn. This is what I want. I I never wanted to get married [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=1871.6s)]
*  um, I never thought it worked and what I mostly see is that it [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=1877.6799999999998s)]
*  When it does it even when it works it works at what I consider a tremendous price [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=1881.8400000000001s)]
*  I mean you said longevity. What did you say before? I was having healthy relationships contributes to longevity. So does sex [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=1888.3200000000002s)]
*  Right, which is sometimes in [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=1895.1200000000001s)]
*  Confrontation with a healthy relationship with a you know, a long-term relationship where the love is deep [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=1897.98s)]
*  It's very hard to keep that going with the [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=1903.5200000000002s)]

*  That it was just attitude that could solve it. But but every marriage in the world will tell you that it's not just attitude [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=1913.5200000000002s)]

*  There there's some people that claim that they're not surprised by how bad it's been so far [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2038.64s)]
*  I find that hard to believe because uh in all the you know [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2041.8400000000001s)]
*  If we knew in october that the planes were going to start bumping we would have maybe said something right? [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2045.9199999999998s)]
*  Like I don't nobody was like hey and then we made invade panama [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2051.12s)]
*  Like that wasn't anything and connell harris wasn't out there being like and don't forget [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2054.24s)]
*  We might invade panama. No that and canada that that's that's that shit all came up. Yeah [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2058.3199999999997s)]
*  I think after the election was [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2064.08s)]
*  Won, I don't think it was even strategic [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2066.3199999999997s)]
*  I think you give trump sometimes too much credit for like playing four-dimensional chess and it's no [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2068.16s)]
*  He just happened to think of it then I really I don't think he planned i'm gonna spring this after the election [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2074.3999999999996s)]
*  It's no like the last guy he talked to said some shit about canada and he was like, let's take it over [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2079.92s)]
*  but a lot of this does seem to like like, you know the the fucking I think the [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2085.2s)]
*  There's such a um [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2090.96s)]
*  There's not just a lack of knowledge where there's a disdain for knowledge [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2092.8799999999997s)]
*  That leads whether it's elon wandering around government bureaucracies. He knows nothing about [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2097.04s)]
*  Cutting at random and then discovering that oh that person was working on bird flu. We should probably get him back [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2102.0s)]
*  Uh, or trump's routing off about uh, the middle east. There's there's a lack of appreciation [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2106.8s)]
*  for [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2113.36s)]
*  expertise and nuance [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2114.62s)]
*  Which is very very fascist very authoritarian, which is to say [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2117.36s)]
*  You know what? Yeah, democracy is sometimes slow and complicated, but there's a reason and there are good reasons [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2120.8s)]
*  There's a good reason [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2127.12s)]
*  Uh that this is not how we've done things in the past there is value to stability [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2128.64s)]
*  There's value to the slow and sometimes frustrating work of compromise changing that is my biggest complaint about trumpets that he does not care [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2133.2s)]
*  About how the american system works or even care to learn? [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2142.96s)]
*  How it works that in his view was just like they elected me i'm the leader [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2147.44s)]
*  I talked to other leaders. I'm the leader what everything else is sort of just background noise congress or whatever [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2152.16s)]
*  I mean some of these things he's done. He has the congress. He has a republican congress [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2158.24s)]
*  He could do it through congress. No, he just does it by executive order, but there's always like [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2162.24s)]
*  You know a seed of truth in the other side [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2167.68s)]
*  yes, government should be slow, but [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2171.44s)]
*  You know the frog in the pot analogy that we use with global warming, which I still think is true. It's the slow [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2174.64s)]
*  I'm not sure that that isn't also the case with a government that ever grows bigger [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2182.24s)]
*  Nothing is ever canceled. Uh the debt. I mean we've been talking about it since ross perot [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2188.16s)]
*  At some point I and and it seems like well, you know, we keep talking about it, but nothing ever happens [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2194.72s)]
*  I feel like at some point just like with global warming something catastrophic is going to happen, but this is where yeah biggest [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2200.24s)]
*  thing now and and so [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2207.92s)]
*  Like again, do I hate the idea of someone going through the government? [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2210.48s)]
*  I mean al gore wanted to do it and they didn't do it well [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2215.36s)]
*  But of course the way he does it first of all, just like you said with a sledgehammer instead of a scalpel [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2219.84s)]
*  Uh, they you can picture a way they could have done he could have just shut up for three months [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2226.0s)]
*  While he audited it and then come out with findings [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2231.1200000000003s)]
*  That's not the way these people work. That's the bad part of them [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2235.28s)]
*  Um the instinct to do it the instinct to like have gaza not be what it always has been [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2239.44s)]
*  Uh, and and by the way, some of this kind of works because now you see that five different countries [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2247.6s)]
*  Jordan saudi arabia. I think it's by right. No [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2253.44s)]
*  united arab emirates [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2257.12s)]
*  Egypt they're all they all said okay, you know what? [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2259.2s)]
*  Trump's gonna jump in and turn it into a golf course. Okay, we're working on a plan [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2263.6s)]
*  Yeah, somebody has to have a plan for gaza and the idea that in the past [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2268.72s)]
*  these these arab countries that surround [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2274.32s)]
*  Palestine or the syrian civil war and wouldn't take any refugees and just wouldn't seem to be [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2277.58s)]
*  Wanting to get involved at all to the people who they claim are their brethren and who are the did a million syrians really? [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2284.24s)]
*  Fit better in germany than they would have in saudi arabia. There's a uh, there was a congressman [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2291.7599999999998s)]
*  Tom malinowski, I think and he he said this on the bulwark and it stuck with me and he said that [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2299.12s)]
*  Uh trump understands our power but not our values and joe biden understands our values, but not our power [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2304.96s)]
*  and it really stuck with me because [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2310.56s)]
*  Uh, there are there are moments where yeah, you know nixon playing crazy donald trump says things that change the [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2312.64s)]
*  The contours of a debate but he does it by proposing ethnic cleansing and some of those ghastly [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2319.6s)]
*  Uh, um, uh policies that any american president has ever [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2324.8s)]
*  Talked about uh, you talk about like yeah, we need to to to reform the government [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2329.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, brock obama wanted to reform the government stupidly try to do it through congress big mistake. That was but [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2333.92s)]
*  You know you talk about oh, we need to do some of these things [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2339.2000000000003s)]
*  We're worried about the deficit. We know what the cost the source of the deficit is we know [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2341.1200000000003s)]
*  It's actually not the debt the debt. We know the source of the debt. We know the source of the deficit the [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2344.88s)]
*  The the number of federal workers has not increased uh as a share of the population that's that's static [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2349.92s)]
*  So there's not some big uh behemoth of of federal workers. It's it's lower than it was in the 90s as a share [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2355.36s)]
*  No, I don't think workers is the main problem. The main problem is as the budget office put out we there's [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2360.48s)]
*  They said between 236 and 521 billion [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2367.68s)]
*  Billion right and what is the source of that is there's there's four drivers of fraud. Well, no, it's not fraud [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2372.2400000000002s)]
*  The source is stuff that's monies that's stolen basically the the the source of our deficit and debt are the tax cuts [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2378.7200000000003s)]
*  The bush tax cuts the trump tax cuts. Okay, the cost of medicare the cost of medicaid the cost of security and cost of military [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2386.1600000000003s)]
*  That's that's what drives the cost. That's it. Okay, then there's cuts to be made and fraud to be found for sure [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2390.88s)]
*  but that's say this was like the number one issue of our time, but [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2394.88s)]
*  Do I think that? [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2399.44s)]
*  236 billion at the low end each year just going out the door to fraudsters and thieves [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2401.5s)]
*  Is something we should live with and just accept I don't of course so the instinct to do something about it [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2408.56s)]
*  And again, it it's all nullified when they do it horribly which he did but the part of this too is [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2413.84s)]
*  It's not obviously they have [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2421.52s)]
*  They don't really respect [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2424.48s)]
*  Debate right like donald trump doesn't isn't interested or respectful nor nor is he needed anymore? [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2427.28s)]
*  Well, because he won and I mean [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2433.36s)]
*  In the past, I mean he did have to like show up to debate he debated harris [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2436.5600000000004s)]
*  He uh, yeah, he he debated joe biden. Um, he debated tried to kill him with covet [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2441.44s)]
*  Remember like three days later like yeah, I had a positive test. Whoops. It's like you tried to fucking kill joe biden [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2448.2400000000002s)]
*  Again, I think you're giving him too much credit. I just think he didn't think about it [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2454.0s)]
*  Um, I think he wanted to run against joe biden. Anyway, he shouldn't have he lost [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2457.5200000000004s)]
*  Um, and he wouldn't admit that which is my biggest problem with him, but but you host a show [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2461.84s)]
*  That's about the value of debate and one of the two sides no longer. They'll use a debate when it's useful [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2467.12s)]
*  They'll use politics normal politics when it's useful, but they'll cast it aside, right? [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2473.52s)]
*  They'll go through congress when they can they'll ignore it when they can't they'll come on your show and make a case when they can [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2478.0s)]
*  But they'll say, uh, you're a an evil marxist and all should be ignored when it's not useful [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2482.88s)]
*  That's really dangerous and I and so yeah, yeah, I agree [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2488.56s)]
*  uh [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2494.08s)]
*  The the speech that vance [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2495.36s)]
*  Made to the germans [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2497.92s)]
*  not the part about [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2500.88s)]
*  The not the semi nazi party but the part about free speech was very valid in my view [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2503.36s)]
*  There are there they have gone to places in germany and in england now with free speech that I don't want to live in that country [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2510.32s)]
*  I mean, did you see the 60 minutes piece on germany last week? [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2517.28s)]
*  I didn't really a 60 minutes like too old hat for you. I just you know, I I catch it now and again [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2520.96s)]
*  But i'm not like i'm not and i'm not like click click click [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2526.8s)]
*  I'm not like waiting for the sound every sunday like I used to when I was a kid when I was a kid [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2528.88s)]
*  I watched it every sunday. Really? It wasn't a cool kid. It [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2531.84s)]
*  It was a lot of it was a lot of bilmar in 60 minutes [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2536.16s)]
*  And and wondering and wondering if I was gonna get invited to prom the answer. I was not [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2538.8s)]
*  But [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2542.4s)]
*  Okay, let's get on to your sex life [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2545.28s)]
*  Okay, so but um, they did a piece and I found it chilling now, of course [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2548.0s)]
*  Vance's thing about free speech is he has no grounding to stand on because trump is suing 60 minutes [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2553.84s)]
*  60 minutes for the crime of editing [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2561.76s)]
*  An interview and and he's suing an iowa newspaper for putting out a poll he didn't like you know, how many presidents? [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2564.48s)]
*  Had lawsuits before him none [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2571.6s)]
*  Presidents don't sue people you don't have to [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2573.66s)]
*  He's doing it. So they don't have a leg to stand on there and as far as like canceling elections [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2576.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean that was the first I heard about Romania cancelled the election [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2582.96s)]
*  I i'd have to do more research on that [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2586.8s)]
*  But yeah, I don't think it's great idea to cancel elections [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2588.88s)]
*  But of course, that's what they tried to do and he still has admitted he lost the one in 2020 [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2591.76s)]
*  Okay, but the idea [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=2596.4s)]

*  Traditionally israel has tried to make that happen for a very long time [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3014.86s)]
*  It accepted the idea of a partition and a two-state solution and the other side never did and somehow the woke [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3019.52s)]

*  Uh, what not just because of what it has done in gaza and not just what it has done to the palestinians [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3129.6s)]
*  But because it is not in the interest of israel, uh, uh to uh, uh create the conditions that they're creating [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3134.56s)]
*  I've like I i I am not I am not what you would call woke on this topic [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3139.8399999999997s)]
*  Uh, but neither are me but not what not what elected democrats are saying which I think represent like the people that would ultimately be [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3145.3599999999997s)]
*  uh wielding [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3153.7599999999998s)]
*  power so like what are the like [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3155.3599999999997s)]
*  Is are there issues where you see like the mainstream democrats elected figures not people on college campuses or organizations? [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3157.44s)]
*  Uh that have moved left because they're captured by uh, whatever lefty part of their staff [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3164.4s)]
*  I know where you're going and and I agree mostly which is that the democratic politician [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3168.88s)]
*  Is generally not a crazy person the crazy [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3174.96s)]
*  You're talking about crazies. Um [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3178.32s)]
*  Um [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3180.88s)]
*  I used to say the difference between the parties is that the republicans have found a place for their crazies [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3182.08s)]
*  Unfortunately, that place is elected government and it's kind of true like there's no equivalent [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3188.62s)]
*  Quite of marjorie taylor green on the left [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3194.72s)]
*  Although there are people like elon omar and aoc who I don't agree with on a lot of stuff [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3197.36s)]
*  And I think are crazy on a lot of stuff and say things that are real eye rolls [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3202.16s)]
*  Uh fair enough. I don't agree with that but but but but I don't I just don't [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3206.48s)]
*  But the the the i'm not saying there. I just said they're not as bad, but they they are eye-rolly. Absolutely [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3210.3199999999997s)]
*  there are things you do and and I disagree with and also just you know, I I mean [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3217.3599999999997s)]
*  it's one thing to be a [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3222.0s)]
*  Have interest in another country. It's another thing to sort of be the uh [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3223.52s)]
*  Palestinian representative in the congress as opposed to representing michigan [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3228.06s)]
*  Yeah, well maybe she feels an obligation a moral obligation that the best way that she can represent her value [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3234.08s)]
*  I know but this is one voice but she's in the american government right? There's 430. There's 434 other members of the house [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3238.96s)]
*  So one should be from palestine [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3245.28s)]
*  I'm not saying one should be from palestine. I'm saying that's what it seems like an important debate [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3247.28s)]
*  Well, it's what it seems like and what it is. She's obviously representing her constituents [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3251.04s)]
*  She has a lot of palestinian constituents [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3253.6800000000003s)]
*  But also feeling like that is a role that she can play in an important debate that she is not just a member of congress for [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3255.12s)]
*  One district but she is representing a point of view that she doesn't feel like is often represented [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3260.6400000000003s)]
*  I don't think there's anything wrong with that even when by the way [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3264.32s)]
*  I have been extremely critical of what she has said, uh, but uh [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3266.32s)]
*  back to the two elected [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3271.28s)]
*  Democrats, I think the reason i'm bringing this up is sometimes I feel like [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3273.44s)]
*  You have democrats there are there is an entire republican apparatus that exists to lift up [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3277.6000000000004s)]
*  The the dumbest most extreme [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3283.28s)]
*  campus professors [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3286.32s)]
*  Organizations also mainstream politicians who say something stupid that comes off terribly and have that represent [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3288.06s)]
*  Democrats and that it actually has an impact and then we end up in a yeah [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3294.94s)]
*  I'm just do you think that's true? I I think it's true, but I also think it's their obligation to [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3298.96s)]
*  Squawk back at those people and they don't do it enough to your point [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3305.2s)]
*  Which I think is correct about the mainstream democratic politician take something like defund the police [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3309.7599999999998s)]
*  The republicans thought they could catch the democrats on that and they put it up to a vote [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3317.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, I remember what the exact vote was or what the bill was [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3322.72s)]
*  They didn't get any I think they got one [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3326.32s)]
*  like the democratic politician [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3329.04s)]
*  Did not take the bait on defund the police and yet [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3331.84s)]
*  The public if you just ask the man on the street probably thinks that a lot of democratic politicians [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3336.32s)]
*  Did sign on to that? [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3343.2799999999997s)]
*  so that's a good example of something that that was put out there by [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3344.96s)]
*  Like you say organizations and the fringe and college professors and people in the media [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3348.7999999999997s)]
*  but [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3354.64s)]
*  Did the democratic congressmen from your district sign on to that? No, they did not at least not in a bill [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3355.7599999999998s)]
*  So but you know [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3362.56s)]
*  They'll put up a quote from kamala harris at the time in 2020 that it makes it look that and people did go overboard in [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3364.0s)]
*  2020. Yeah, okay [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3371.2599999999998s)]
*  So that's the problem is that the democratic politician did not make it clear to the voter [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3372.96s)]
*  Yeah, we're not for defunding the police. We think that's stupid [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3379.28s)]
*  The police are important and they're especially important in neighborhoods with a lot of people of color [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3382.96s)]
*  Well, so who did not want to defund the police? [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3388.6400000000003s)]
*  So I I largely agree with that, but I I think sometimes we lay the blame at the feet of democrats [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3390.8s)]
*  for two reasons one [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3397.12s)]
*  Is that the media is biased and you know, there's bias in the media [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3399.2s)]
*  but one of the ways the media is biased is that it [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3403.2799999999997s)]
*  Treats democrats as the protagonist and republicans as the antagonist [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3406.16s)]
*  So democrats have agency they're people you can reach they're people you can persuade [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3409.2799999999997s)]
*  They're people you believe will try to do the right thing [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3412.56s)]
*  And they're people that will actually respond to you. You're saying they are or that's how they're portrayed [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3415.2799999999997s)]
*  I think that's how them [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3419.3599999999997s)]
*  I think when when people feel that there's a liberal bias and a lot of mainstream coverage [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3420.16s)]
*  Of it is that they are treated like the protagonist republicans are if not villains [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3424.56s)]
*  They're kind of other and removed correct and democrats are meant to be [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3428.8s)]
*  Uh the people that respond in the new york times. It's it's like assumed. We are the good people [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3432.96s)]
*  We are the good people who know the right answers to everything and they are the people who are not good [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3438.7200000000003s)]
*  Yes that that assumption and that attitude [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3444.08s)]
*  Is is something that very much fosters resentment and I don't blame the people [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3447.2000000000003s)]
*  Like I always say you could hate trump you can't hate everybody who voted for him [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3452.4s)]
*  It's half the country, but one of the that's a lot of the reason why they do [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3455.44s)]
*  Well, one of the one of the other things it does though is it? [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3458.64s)]
*  Um, it it it means republicans aren't held as much accountable for their own decisions [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3462.0s)]
*  Not at all. And I think part of it too. The other piece of it is that people are just uncomfortable with saying [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3467.04s)]
*  Um, hold on a second [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3472.08s)]
*  There's a yeah democrats should do a better job of tamping down misinformation and lies, but we're drowning in it [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3474.16s)]
*  We're drowning in it. Yeah, I wish democrats were better at pushing back against this bullshit [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3479.84s)]
*  But we're kind of asking them to solve for a society problem. Like you got like jerry connelly in the uh, uh, uh, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3484.56s)]
*  as the as the um, uh minority leader in this house committee, uh raising his hand to beg, uh, [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3492.4s)]
*  uh nancy mace to stop saying a slur and it's like [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3499.36s)]
*  We can't win a fight that way. We're not going to be able to we like we're [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3503.36s)]
*  These people don't care what you have to say [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3507.6s)]
*  They don't they want the fight they want they want you to to yell at them for saying the wrong thing [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3509.6s)]
*  They don't they don't care what you have to say about any of this [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3514.4s)]
*  Yeah, and don't take the bait. I mean that's what a lot of [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3517.3599999999997s)]
*  Democrats are coming around to I think I was talking about this on my show last friday about [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3521.8199999999997s)]
*  wasn't it, uh, [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3528.16s)]
*  you know people you've probably worked with i'm thinking david axelrod and [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3530.08s)]
*  Somebody else like that said, um on usa. Oh, I know we had on congressman tim ryan [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3534.64s)]
*  And I was I was quoting axelrod and somebody else who said, you know on usa aid [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3542.24s)]
*  Uh, don't make don't that's not a hill i'm gonna die on [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3549.52s)]
*  I think that was exactly and I just read a list of things to congressman ryan who I think is going to run for governor [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3552.48s)]
*  Of ohio saying tell me what else is a hill you will or won't die on [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3558.24s)]
*  That's what the democrats I think should be talking about with each other [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3563.84s)]
*  What are the hills we're going to die on and what are the hills we're not and it was kind of interesting to hear [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3567.6800000000003s)]
*  His response to this list [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3572.96s)]
*  Yeah, and and I think there are like those are the political questions the strategic questions we have to ask [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3574.96s)]
*  But I think it's also worth saying hold on a second [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3579.76s)]
*  The the trump administration is illegally shutting down a government agency that is our [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3584.48s)]
*  Counterweight to china around the world true and we all kind of understand that it's hard to tell people why it's important [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3589.68s)]
*  And nobody's gonna understand is you got to let that one go. I made that point. I said what's about leadership? [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3596.72s)]
*  What about right saying the people aren't here and it's our duty [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3601.68s)]
*  To that as politics. That's what we're supposed to do is lead them to a place because the republicans never shrink [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3606.7999999999997s)]
*  From leading people to a place where the people aren't [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3612.96s)]
*  That never intimidates them the people were for a public option [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3617.12s)]
*  For a very long time with the health care debate and they were like, yeah, we had 20 points in the polls [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3621.52s)]
*  We could we could we could flip that [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3627.36s)]
*  So there is that argument [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3630.48s)]
*  But you know what? Do you do you want to win another election? [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3632.24s)]
*  Is there even going to be another election? [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3636.16s)]
*  I mean that that was my original thing about trump when everyone was saying I was crazy [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3637.92s)]
*  He doesn't consider he's never going to concede an election. I just feel like [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3642.08s)]
*  That we probably have already crossed the rubicon on this. I just don't see this crowd [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3646.72s)]
*  Ever really giving up power because they really believe in their bones [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3652.64s)]
*  And again, I could go through a lot of things that that make me understand why they think that way [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3656.96s)]
*  Although i'm not with them, of course on it, but they think that the left is so crazy [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3662.32s)]
*  And so dangerous [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3667.04s)]
*  And some of their ideas are so [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3668.96s)]
*  aggressively anti-common sense and they are [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3671.58s)]

*  To preserve power to just not ever let those people near the levers of power because it's just too crazy [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3678.72s)]

*  doctors [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3821.04s)]

*  So I think I read that so there are so look there are delicate problems here [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3858.48s)]
*  But wait, wait, there's delicate problems here and there's delicate problem where you have a kid [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3862.0s)]
*  All right who has is either non-binary or trans who feels scared [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3866.2400000000002s)]
*  At home feels unsafe at home. Those things happen in the world [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3871.84s)]
*  There are things that happen with they do for the most part. That's not what we're talking about for the most part [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3874.7200000000003s)]
*  What we're talking about is a teenager [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3878.56s)]
*  Who has felt that they are? [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3881.6000000000004s)]
*  Uh, uh, they have a gender dysmorphia. So what they feel like is that that they they don't they they feel [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3883.84s)]
*  Deeply unhappy depression all really rampant. Yes, and they go to their parents [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3890.32s)]
*  They feel that and then they blame it on the thing that has been put in their mind way too much [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3894.24s)]
*  That it may be because of you're in the wrong body to put it probably wrongly [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3900.48s)]
*  But sure that we understand what that means. Okay. Now it could be that case when trump said [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3905.68s)]
*  There's only two sexes again [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3911.52s)]
*  Pendulum swinging way too far to stupidity. Okay, obviously sex is more complicated than just two sexes [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3914.16s)]
*  There are people who absolutely [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3921.12s)]
*  You know are quote unquote in the wrong body [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3923.6s)]
*  But when you're a kid when even a teenager and you're that confused about everything and you have no idea [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3926.56s)]
*  And you're upset for many other reasons the idea that they put it. Let me just finish [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3932.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm not saying I know I could see you already. I could see you pulling back the bow [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3937.2799999999997s)]
*  Uh, and the the fact that that they put this in their head too much. That's my thing. Should you tell a kid? [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3941.52s)]
*  Um, look there's a default setting for humans male and female but there are variations that's absolutely true [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3948.96s)]
*  Some people are attracted people of their own sex and some people are actually in the quote unquote wrong body [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3956.32s)]
*  and that does happen but [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3962.56s)]
*  the the amount that they [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3964.6400000000003s)]
*  Emphasize this I compared it once on my show to entrapment [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3967.98s)]
*  So see there you go [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3973.92s)]
*  I'm really I disagree. I'm sorry. Is that not the end is it? [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3975.92s)]
*  Can I explain it? Yes explain I mean, I think we all get it but yeah explain it entrapment [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3979.92s)]
*  I don't think everybody does get it. Okay, explain it. Okay. Well, what is entrapment? [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3983.6800000000003s)]
*  Entrapment is when you suggest something to people [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3988.3s)]
*  that they weren't [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3991.92s)]
*  Ordinarily going to do I use the example of after 9 11 [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3993.28s)]
*  Uh, the fbi got caught basically entrapping some people which is what they went to people who yeah who are excuse me [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=3996.96s)]
*  I'm not done. All right. I'm sorry [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4003.84s)]
*  You're right. Honestly, that was rude and that was rude that was rude bill finish [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4006.32s)]
*  You're explaining how being trans is like being recruited into al-qaeda [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4010.48s)]
*  Well, that's that's glib and absolutely 100 glib stupid and glib it is yes [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4015.28s)]
*  Because it's not true. Right you didn't even let me get through the you're right and now I gotta go [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4021.04s)]
*  You're just gonna leave we're having the middle of a debate. Yeah. No, okay. I'll finish this [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4025.36s)]
*  Entrapment like okay, so they they go to somebody they go to a group of guys [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4029.66s)]
*  They did to this in a group of poor black guys in miami and were unhappy with [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4033.84s)]
*  America and you know, hey, wouldn't it be great if we blew up the sears tower in chicago? [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4039.34s)]
*  And these guys didn't even have a gun [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4044.32s)]
*  And it's like yeah, I hate america or I got problems with america. That does sound kind of cool [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4046.56s)]
*  And hey, well we can get you the explosives and that's entrapment. Okay, you put an idea in people's heads [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4051.1200000000003s)]
*  That wouldn't been there otherwise [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4057.76s)]
*  Do I think in most of america they did that in schools I don't but I think in enough of them in enough far left places [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4060.7200000000003s)]
*  they did [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4068.2400000000002s)]
*  Constantly have this idea in in the minds of children [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4069.6600000000003s)]
*  That maybe you're not in the right body. I mean the uh, new england journal of medicine [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4074.88s)]
*  Uh advocated for taking sex off of a birth certificate. I believe it was like it's your [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4080.7200000000003s)]
*  Assigned your assigned sex assigned says the birth. Yeah, you're assigned. I think that's right [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4086.88s)]
*  I was assigned it by my dick. Okay when I was born. Yes, and again to tell kids [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4092.16s)]
*  It doesn't always have to be and isn't always [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4097.44s)]
*  The default setting but that's a different mentality than they put in the minds of kids and that's why [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4100.96s)]
*  This debate goes on and the fact that you think or a lot of people on the left think that [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4108.4s)]
*  Even if you just have this debate it makes you a bigot [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4113.04s)]
*  You just have to roll over that was you asked about the biden administration [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4115.92s)]
*  That was their position if you even question this you're some sort of a bigot [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4119.84s)]
*  And it this is new science and it has to do with children [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4124.64s)]
*  And the it's not going to look good in the future that position. Can I just respond to something now? [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4128.0s)]
*  You can now I can respond. All right, can you just? [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4132.96s)]
*  All right, let's just see you definitely said your piece just say your bullshit while i'm in the bathroom [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4136.96s)]
*  Just stay for one second, okay, unbelievable. I'm kidding. I know I know okay a lot of things there first of all [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4141.44s)]
*  This is going to sound [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4153.28s)]
*  confrontational for a long time people said oh, uh [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4155.18s)]
*  Older gay people are recruiting kids to be gay [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4159.04s)]
*  And they wouldn't really be gay. It was they were being recruited [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4162.8s)]
*  They were being groomed that that they were being drawn [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4165.5199999999995s)]
*  That was their conservative position the christian right position for a long time was the reason you didn't want to have gay teachers [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4168.4s)]
*  Is they're going to recruit that the gay lifestyle is going to look so enticing and so exciting that it's going to bring these [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4173.759999999999s)]
*  These poor defenseless boys they mostly boys into the gay lifestyle and destroy their lives [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4180.32s)]
*  But of course that wasn't true. Really all gay teachers were an example, right? [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4186.32s)]
*  Yeah, look there are a few examples of people getting older and realizing that they shouldn't have transitioned that happens [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4190.5599999999995s)]
*  It's real that's real. Yeah more than a few but [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4198.0s)]
*  They're also uh really important surgeries that people get for their heart and they go wrong and somebody dies and nobody says we must [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4200.96s)]
*  Stop the cardiologists. No one says we must stop the surgeons. We say let's your analogy [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4206.96s)]
*  Well, my analogy is only that wait, let me finish that i'm just i finish. Yes, is it my turn to talk? [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4211.76s)]
*  You're right [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4218.16s)]
*  And and what you say is let's make sure that this version of it is being practiced [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4220.16s)]
*  As well, we don't we don't uh get rid of the specific surgery. We don't throw out a whole field of medicine [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4224.08s)]
*  We say let's make sure we're doing it in a way that's healthy the science the research [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4229.36s)]
*  All right makes clear that yes, there are exceptions. Yes. There are people practicing it [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4233.68s)]
*  In ways that maybe go too far. But for the most part [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4238.5599999999995s)]
*  Study after study shows that gender affirming care saves wait, let me i'm talking [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4241.44s)]
*  It's my turn. I was so quiet for so long after I interrupted you were okay [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4246.64s)]
*  But once I stopped talking boy, I was good at it [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4251.04s)]
*  And that gender affirming care saves a lot of lives and the and the truth is we talk about these edge cases talk about athletes [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4254.24s)]
*  Talk about locker rooms [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4261.04s)]
*  but for the most part what we're talking about is a very small group of people [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4261.76s)]
*  That just want the opportunity to live and express themselves [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4265.5199999999995s)]
*  And there is a war on that group of people from the right to make salient extreme cases edge cases [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4268.64s)]
*  Not for the purposes of stopping those but for doing what the trump administration is doing entirely [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4274.8s)]
*  Which is stopping all gender affirming care altogether and making trans people [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4279.04s)]
*  Fucking nervous when they have to pee at the airport, right? Which is the end result of all of this [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4283.04s)]
*  Of course, that's awful and I agree with all that except the part about the studies. There was a very big story this year [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4287.84s)]
*  It was in the front page in the new york times [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4294.64s)]
*  A woman I forget her name and she had done like it was a 10-year study [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4297.52s)]
*  Did not release it on purpose because she said it would weaponize [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4302.56s)]
*  The argument from the other side so in other words it came out not the way you wanted the study to come out [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4307.68s)]
*  Yeah, not what you said that it's oh every all the studies show that no it is a mixed bag. That's true [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4314.72s)]
*  Okay, some some people yes, it's the right thing but to take that risk at that age before you know shit about anything [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4321.04s)]
*  Yes, sometimes it's pretty obvious that that this should it's it's a very hard call to make and again [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4329.12s)]
*  This was a very long study very thorough and they wouldn't release it because it came up with the wrong conclusion [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4335.919999999999s)]
*  But because it is a hard question because it is a serious question, right? It is a personal question [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4343.919999999999s)]
*  I don't want donald trump deciding I want parents and doctors. You just said parents can get shut out [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4348.719999999999s)]
*  Well, I don't think parents should get shut out. There are rare exceptions that look [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4353.919999999999s)]
*  We all believe that parents should have the decisions over their children [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4357.919999999999s)]
*  But we also recognize that some parents do such a bad fucking job [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4360.5599999999995s)]
*  Uh that the kids are in danger that happens in outside of trans issues that happens all the time [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4363.92s)]
*  It's terrible [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4367.68s)]
*  Some parents are fucking terrible somehow that the fact that there are terrible parents in the world gets gets erased on these questions [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4368.4800000000005s)]
*  I do I think that schools should but as a baseline be keeping a secret from parents a fucking course not no one thinks that [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4374.320000000001s)]
*  No one thinks apparently that's not true. People do think that and [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4380.400000000001s)]
*  There is no perfect answer to this. It's as many naughty questions the least bad answer [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4384.56s)]
*  And the least bad answer is to not let the government decide from above it's just to leave it up to people and parents [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4390.639999999999s)]
*  And the kids and the doctors [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4396.639999999999s)]
*  Right, uh, you want the government to ban gender affirming care for kids? [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4398.959999999999s)]
*  You want you want to lose every election? [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4402.639999999999s)]
*  Just keep coming down on the side of parents coming in second into a who gets to decide what goes on with my kid contest [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4404.959999999999s)]
*  First of all, i'm not talking about winning or losing election. I agree. I agree with all that [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4413.12s)]
*  But i'm just talking about the issue itself. What did that card say? Can I take this one home as a as a sure? [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4415.919999999999s)]
*  As a souvenir. I'm gonna put it in my scrapbook. Let me see if I hit all my points that I wanted to make about this [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4420.32s)]
*  uh boy [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4426.24s)]
*  Like they they don't even see couldn't they have started it says [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4428.64s)]
*  Um, I guess this week it's tough. It has blow country and say that name bill maher bill [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4432.4s)]
*  Couldn't they have started this on the next card? [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4436.72s)]
*  Don't you think that word bill should have been started on the next card? No, i'm not trying to get anybody in trouble [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4438.96s)]
*  Um, let's not you gotta go. That's good. That's it. You're just leaving. Yeah, i'm just leaving bill maher everybody. Thank you [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4443.84s)]
*  You [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z15gWRBaPMk&t=4450.08s)]
