Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Kamala Harris Leads Trump In Polls After Debate + Lovett Eliminated First On Survivor
**Pod Save America:** [September 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U)
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Jon Favreau. I'm Dan Pfeiffer. On today's show, Kamala Harris's campaign drives a message on [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=0.0s)]
*  Reproductor Freedom with a searing new ad and a live-streamed event with Oprah Winfrey. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=6.18s)]
*  Donald Trump tries to win over swing voters in New York, DC, and the Fox News audience. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  And speaking of former reality TV stars, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=16.64s)]
*  Dan, Tommy, and I hold our own Tribal Council with a survivor contestant who was voted off early [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=19.78s)]
*  but can still win if Jeff Probst has the courage. Our very own [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=25.66s)]
*  Jon Love it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=31.1s)]
*  Cannot wait. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=33.26s)]
*  Cannot wait for this. Let's get through this politics and let's get to survivor fast. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=35.26s)]
*  Oh, yeah, we're also going to talk about the the Republican nominee for governor in North Carolina [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=38.46s)]
*  has called himself a black Nazi and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=44.78s)]
*  posted on on porn message boards under an alias, so [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=48.06s)]
*  We're gonna get to that too. It's quite a quite a day here. All right, but first [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=53.5s)]
*  We have had a polling tsunami in the 24 hours since Dan you recorded Wednesday's pod with the DSU [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=60.1s)]
*  Including the post debate New York Times Sienna poll that us sickos have been checking our phones for at 4 a.m. Every morning [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=68.66s)]
*  I won't I won't bore all you non-sickos with every top line and crosstab [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=76.1s)]
*  but [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=81.82s)]
*  When you take all the high quality polling and averages together [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=83.13999999999999s)]
*  Here's what you get Kamala Harris has about a three-point lead nationally [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=87.13999999999999s)]
*  one point lead in Pennsylvania a [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=92.97999999999999s)]
*  two-point lead in [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=95.69999999999999s)]
*  Wisconsin and Michigan and every other swing state [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=97.25999999999999s)]
*  basically tied [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=100.61999999999999s)]
*  Under a pool either under a point with a Harris lead or a Trump lead [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=102.33999999999999s)]
*  The Times had an especially interesting sort of head-scratching result [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=106.5s)]
*  They have Trump and Harris tied at 47 nationally, which is a statistically meaningless one-point improvement [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=110.94s)]
*  From their pre-debate poll, but they also did a separate Pennsylvania poll that has Harris up [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=118.14s)]
*  50 to 46 which is the exact same results as their last Pennsylvania poll a couple months ago [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=124.62s)]
*  Altogether there were eight [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=131.46s)]
*  Pennsylvania polls that dropped this week most of them in the last 24 hours many from high quality pollsters and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=133.9s)]
*  They did most of them did show movement to Harris from their previous polls [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=141.54000000000002s)]
*  but still [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=146.58s)]
*  One point race in the most important swing state in the country [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=147.9s)]
*  So I know you and Adi so talked about the state of the race on Wednesday, but because I am a sicko [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=153.86s)]
*  I had to talk to you about the poll apocalypse [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=158.68s)]
*  Polling tsunami. I'm trying out different different names. I'm gonna pull apocalypse because the polls are actually kind of good [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=163.16s)]
*  What's your take from time sienna and? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  How can they have the race tied nationally, but Harris ahead in Pennsylvania? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=171.32000000000002s)]
*  Shouldn't it be the other way around? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=177.0s)]
*  It doesn't make a ton of sense right Biden won the popular vote in 2020 by four and a half points [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  He won, Pennsylvania by one point two points [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=184.9s)]
*  So if these two times polls are correct in Kamala Harris is tied nationally with Trump, but not by four Pennsylvania [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=187.12s)]
*  That's a seven point swing over the course of four years [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=192.1s)]
*  Which seems just impossible to imagine and it is different than the polling averages right which have [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=195.18s)]
*  Pennsylvania Harris as you mentioned up three up one in Pennsylvania that makes a little more sense [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=201.16s)]
*  That's sort of consistent with 2020 now [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=206.38s)]
*  I will say and Nate Cohn to his credit they cone the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=208.54s)]
*  the person in charge of the New York Times in a polling wrote a column where he [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=213.01999999999998s)]
*  Wrestled with the with this conflicting result and and I think to his credit is more willing to [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=217.14000000000001s)]
*  Address the possible fallibility of the polls they do than any other any other media pollster [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=224.46s)]
*  so he's willing to say like maybe it's maybe it's not right here's some reasons it might be right and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=228.70000000000002s)]
*  one of the things within the poll that I think is interesting which could suggest that maybe the not the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=233.46s)]
*  electoral college Republican bias may be shrinking is [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=240.22000000000003s)]
*  In the Pennsylvania poll [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=243.34s)]
*  Trump has a four-point lead on the economy [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=247.14000000000001s)]
*  Nationally is a 13-point lead and the reason why I think that's interesting is maybe it is noise [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=250.06s)]
*  Maybe it's just an overly friendly Pennsylvania sample [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=254.3s)]
*  But it's also true that Pennsylvania has seen more messaging than any state. It's where Kamala Harris campaigns the most [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=257.1s)]
*  It's where the most money is spent on ads and so it would make sense that if she is making progress in defining herself [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=263.86s)]
*  Particularly on the economy where they're spending the most money that it would be you would see those results in [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=270.38s)]
*  Pennsylvania first because in the vast majority of the country the people are seeing no [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=274.09999999999997s)]
*  Kamala Harris communications at all. No Trump communications [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=277.5s)]
*  They are bystanders to the race and then the one other point here and just like I said, it could all be noise [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=280.46s)]
*  it could be wrong but Jacob Rubashkin of inside elections pointed out that just a a [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=285.98s)]
*  Decent sized drop in the Democratic margin in big states like New York and California would shrink the national [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=291.9s)]
*  Popular foot margin by at least a point and there is a separate Sienna College poll which shows [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=298.34s)]
*  Harris underperforming by in 2020 numbers in New York, although still winning by a lot [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=303.97999999999996s)]
*  So a lot to unpack here, but it seems unlikely but it is possible [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=308.65999999999997s)]
*  There's a where on which it is true that you could be essentially tie nationally or you know [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=313.21999999999997s)]
*  Up a pointer down a point because it's all in the margin of error and have a little lead in, Pennsylvania [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=317.08s)]
*  the scenario where [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=321.02s)]
*  Democrats are doing [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=322.84s)]
*  slightly worse in [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=324.38s)]
*  Non-swing states and that's what shrinks the electoral card the Electoral College advantage for Republicans is [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=326.42s)]
*  similar to what happened in 2022 in the midterms where [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=333.42s)]
*  All these national polls showed it closer people still thought maybe a red wave was coming some of that was just you know [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=337.86s)]
*  Republican pollsters putting out garbage polls, but [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=344.98s)]
*  in these swing states where you were [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=348.38s)]
*  Running where Democrats were running races and pouring all money and time and energy and resources and volunteers into [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=351.14s)]
*  Those Democrats just tended to do better than just Democrats in states where we weren't as focused [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=358.26s)]
*  Because they weren't as competitive [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=365.61999999999995s)]
*  And so, you know, we did see that in the midterm. So it is possible [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=368.09999999999997s)]
*  I also think I mean you said it initially like if the if the national average is [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=371.65999999999997s)]
*  Three if she's up by three then then a poll that comes out with her tide [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=378.21999999999997s)]
*  Fits with a national average of her being ahead by three because these are all it's still margin of error [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=383.78s)]
*  Even when you do polling averages, it's still margin of error because you're it's just a larger sample of voters [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=390.26s)]
*  And so that's not too crazy [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=394.78s)]
*  And then you know a poll that shows her up being four in Pennsylvania when the averages show her up one same thing [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=397.26s)]
*  It's like it's it's not crazy right like you just get polls that are that are gonna be you know [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=404.26s)]
*  If the average is one you're gonna get pull some polls that are up for up five some polls where she's down three or four [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=409.26s)]
*  Like that's just the way pulling works. So we've now had enough polling though that I think we can assess [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=414.92s)]
*  The impact of the debate right we're more than a week out from the debate [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=420.74s)]
*  We've now had just more polls than we've had in in one given any more in one given period maybe in the whole race [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=424.38s)]
*  What would you say is the impact of the debate the impact the debate is similar to the impact of Donald Trump being convicted of a felony [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=431.6s)]
*  And Donald Trump being shot in the ear [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=438.6s)]
*  Which is about a point [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=441.04s)]
*  and it's just this is it's just the other matter that this is a game of [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=443.84000000000003s)]
*  inches and [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=447.52000000000004s)]
*  You're just not seeing gigantic movement and even within the national if you look at the times pre debate poll the times post debate poll [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=449.72s)]
*  The two numbers that stick out are the number of people who feel like they need to know more about Kamala Harris is virtually unchanged from [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=456.26s)]
*  the previous poll the number of people who think that she is a risky choice or [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=463.94s)]
*  represents more of the same another number of worth noting is basically unchanged and so for I [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=469.02s)]
*  Think she did herself good. She's you know a lot of the point [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=473.98s)]
*  So she's improved her favorability rating and other polling but it has not been enough to as of yet move people who were in [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=476.86s)]
*  Undecided category into her category and that's I don't think hugely shocking [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=482.7s)]
*  But it's just a reminder of like what slow grinding work this election is [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=487.02s)]
*  Maybe this is a rosier take but I think if you squint at the polling since the debate it shows [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=491.9s)]
*  slight movement toward her right and [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=500.86s)]
*  Even digging into that times poll [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=505.02s)]
*  It's true that the percentage of people who said they need to know more about her hasn't really changed [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=507.26s)]
*  But down to point down two points. Yeah, and when you they asked a question [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=512.9s)]
*  Did you learn a lot a little? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=518.22s)]
*  Nothing at all about Kamala Harris and Donald Trump because of the debate [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=523.22s)]
*  Like the percentage of people who said they learned a lot or some about her that was new [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=527.6999999999999s)]
*  Was much higher than Donald Trump, which is not surprising but and it was also like a it was like in the 30s 40s and [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=533.02s)]
*  That's a pretty for especially for some subgroups, right? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=539.94s)]
*  And that's a pretty good number. I think and the fact that she has rising favor, but remember she has a different [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=543.26s)]
*  Trajectory here different task ahead of her than Donald Trump does everyone knows who Donald Trump is and Donald Trump's trying to disqualify Kamala Harris [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=550.74s)]
*  Everyone knew who Joe Biden was too with Kamala Harris [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=559.3000000000001s)]
*  We've said she has so much more room to grow and [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=562.5s)]
*  As you see her favorability creeping up even as all this money is being spent against her by Donald Trump [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=565.34s)]
*  on ads especially in a state like Pennsylvania and her favorability is going up anyway and [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=571.5s)]
*  I think the debate for the people who watch the debate and again the poll shows this to the Times poll if you watch the [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=576.14s)]
*  debate you were much more likely to [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=581.9399999999999s)]
*  support Kamala Harris than if you didn't watch the debate or if you would just heard about the debate and [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=583.6999999999999s)]
*  So I think for people who watch that debate they tended to come away with a more favorable impression of her [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=588.42s)]
*  They got to know more about what she stands for for a lot of people for a lot of undecided voters [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=593.9399999999999s)]
*  Not enough still but they they learned some and they were reminded what a jackass Donald Trump is [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=598.38s)]
*  And so I think that like she did some she did some good work. Oh for sure, you know [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=603.8599999999999s)]
*  What would you say she has left to do? Like what are her big? What's her to-do list for the next six weeks? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=608.38s)]
*  it's to fill in the rest of the [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=614.9399999999999s)]
*  The picture on everything in particular the economy like that is the one thing that stands out even though there were those [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=617.3000000000001s)]
*  I think those very good numbers in around in Pennsylvania [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=622.3000000000001s)]
*  When you go back and you watch that debate the economy is an afterthought [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=625.4200000000001s)]
*  It was the first couple questions her answers were good in that question [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=628.6600000000001s)]
*  The the message has been seen afterwards shown that those were some of her best most popular answers with swing voters [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=632.3800000000001s)]
*  But they're not the things that are being sent around on tik-tok and Instagram and getting covered in the media [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=637.62s)]
*  And so, you know her biggest task was to educate people about her approach to the economy and she didn't get as much of an [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=642.78s)]
*  Opportunity to do that as I think she would like so that stands out as a huge [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=649.26s)]
*  Task for her and it's just I think you have it exactly right people learned a lot about her [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=653.54s)]
*  But they still want to know more so she made progress [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=657.62s)]
*  But she hasn't closed the sale and so it's to spend the next seven weeks continuing to [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=660.02s)]
*  Fill in that picture for this very critical very small slice of voters that she needs to put her over the top [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=664.8199999999999s)]
*  I think she could use an answer on the economy for whatever interviews [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=670.74s)]
*  She does that is a little tighter a little more focused and a little broader in who her plans will help [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=674.94s)]
*  I think that and I think this was the right thing to do but during the debate and maybe in the couple interviews [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=683.46s)]
*  She's done since then there's a lot of talk about [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=689.1400000000001s)]
*  Her values. She's a middle-class kid. She cares about the middle class and you know, that's great [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=691.9000000000001s)]
*  That's probably what every consultant told her to do as they should and you want and especially with someone who's not as defined as [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=698.3s)]
*  Her you want to ground your plans in your values [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=705.18s)]
*  So I totally that's right [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=707.98s)]
*  But then she sort of it's like a lot of words to get to she gets to the housing stuff at some point [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=709.34s)]
*  She then gets to the child care tax credit [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=715.54s)]
*  But listening to focus groups since the debate Sarah Longwell's focus groups reading some of the New York Times [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=719.46s)]
*  Focus groups of undecided voters what you get from some people is it was nice to hear that stuff [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=726.42s)]
*  I don't necessarily know that it was gonna apply to me like what's how am I gonna be helped under a Harris presidency? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=731.46s)]
*  What's she gonna do for me? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=739.1s)]
*  And also, you know, she didn't give a straight answer on the economy and it took her too long [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=740.06s)]
*  And I think I couldn't quite get what she was saying [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=745.18s)]
*  so I think like I mean she's got a tax cut a middle-class tax cut that's gonna [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=746.78s)]
*  Go to a hundred million Americans, right? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=751.4200000000001s)]
*  Like I would go right to that and then with every plan or every policy that she has proposal [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=753.5s)]
*  I would have a contrast with Donald Trump, right? So like what do you want to do in the economy? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=759.6600000000001s)]
*  Well, you know Donald Trump wants to give a tax cut to billionaires [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=764.4200000000001s)]
*  I want to give a tax cut to a hundred million middle-class Americans, right? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=766.6600000000001s)]
*  I want to make sure I want to lower the cost of health care even more [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=770.1400000000001s)]
*  I want to lower the cost of drugs even more [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=772.98s)]
*  Here's how I do that, right? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=774.34s)]
*  Like I think whatever the list is just pick like five things and have that be your thing that you say [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=775.22s)]
*  Everywhere and all your surrogates say and it's in ads and everything else [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=779.72s)]
*  Yeah, I think that she needs she needs a five [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=782.72s)]
*  It's I don't say a five-point plan like you don't have to put on a card or anything, but it is I'm gonna lower [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=784.72s)]
*  Lower prices for you by stopping price gouging. I'm gonna lower housing causes by by capping rent costs and [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=789.72s)]
*  Making sure we build more homes [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=796.6s)]
*  I'm gonna lower the cost of health care while and while Donald Trump's gonna repeal the Affordable Care Act and I'm gonna give the [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=798.04s)]
*  largest middle-class tax cut in [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=803.4399999999999s)]
*  History or whatever the right way to say the fact the fact-check appropriate way of saying that is [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=805.7600000000001s)]
*  Paid for by asking the wealthy and corporations to pay a little bit more [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=810.2800000000001s)]
*  I'm glad you mentioned the price gouging because I know the all the fucking nerds out there and policy nerds are a little so-so on [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=814.8000000000001s)]
*  The price gouging proposals. It's like you know what? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=822.0200000000001s)]
*  Kamala Harris she has a record on this when she was attorney general [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=825.48s)]
*  Went after the big banks on behalf of homeowners succeeded went after for-profit colleges screwing over students succeeded [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=829.4s)]
*  She can go after she can talk about her record and then talk about how she's gonna go after companies that [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=836.8199999999999s)]
*  Are just gouging consumers and jacking up prices for no good reason and I think it's an extremely popular proposal [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=842.4799999999999s)]
*  It's just something that she's gonna feel comfortable saying because she has a record on it and it suddenly just sort of fell out of her answers [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=850.28s)]
*  After the convention and I'm not sure why [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=856.94s)]
*  I'm glad you have [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=860.9000000000001s)]
*  Reignited one of the great rivalries in American life policy nerds for us polling nerds [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=862.7s)]
*  Or you know people who want to win elections [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=867.5400000000001s)]
*  I don't know people who are pissed about rising prices and would like someone to like go after corporations and hold them accountable [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=869.9000000000001s)]
*  I don't know anyway [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=875.5s)]
*  Alright, let's talk about the two campaigns are doing to win over the potential swing state voters who are still undecided with six weeks to go [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=876.98s)]
*  Donald Trump is busy storming the battlegrounds of New York and DC [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=883.86s)]
*  On Wednesday night Trump held a rally at the Nassau Coliseum on Long Island before heading to Manhattan [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=888.5s)]
*  To appear on Greg Gutfeld's primetime show a real surgical targeted approach to campaigning with a message to match [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=894.4200000000001s)]
*  Here's some of what he said patriotic New Yorkers must get your asses out to vote [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=901.9000000000001s)]
*  Get it get it [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=908.58s)]
*  Harry get up Harry [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=910.98s)]
*  Harry get your fat ass out of the couch [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=912.98s)]
*  You're gonna vote for Trump today Harry, but I'd say baby who could do it like me. Nobody could do it like me [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=916.62s)]
*  How great am I in the next two weeks? I'm going to Springfield and I'm going to Aurora [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=922.5400000000001s)]
*  You may never see me again, but that's okay. Gotta do what I gotta do [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=927.98s)]
*  Whatever happened to Trump. Well, he never got out of Springfield [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=932.5s)]
*  Americans deserve a campaign based on the issues we try and keep it on the issues [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=936.38s)]
*  You know, they said I'm the goat in debates because I had a lot of debates and I became president and the goat means greatest of all [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=942.58s)]
*  Time he said and they didn't correct her once and they corrected me everything I said practically [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=950.62s)]
*  and I think nine times or 11 times and the audience was [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=956.46s)]
*  Absolutely, they went crazy and they said Joe it's over you getting out and he said I'm not getting out you get now [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=960.86s)]
*  and they put her in and [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=967.5s)]
*  she's somehow a [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=970.02s)]
*  woman [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=972.22s)]
*  Somehow she's doing better than he did. Yeah, but I can't imagine it can last [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=973.38s)]
*  Look he's just trying to have a campaign on the issues we should note that of course there was no audience at the debate [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=982.86s)]
*  Can you imagine I hate [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=989.22s)]
*  We would have there would be 700 news cycles about it he imagined a debate audience he imagined a debate [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=995.98s)]
*  We're like, that's fine. He's just what wacky Trump. He's not this fucking brain is melting before our eyes [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1002.58s)]
*  I think it's more like he lies [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1006.74s)]
*  so [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1010.66s)]
*  Easily right and like all the only thing that's going on in his brain is like [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1012.02s)]
*  How can I talk about how wonderful I am how great I'm how many people love me right people love me everywhere [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1016.98s)]
*  There's audiences everywhere I go. There's crowds. They're screaming that people are coming up to me grown men. They're crying. Mr. Trump [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1021.6600000000001s)]
*  You're wonderful. Right? It's it's sort of that part of his brain [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1026.3s)]
*  That's just like no matter what he's talking about doesn't matter what actually happened [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1029.7s)]
*  He just needs to talk about the crowds loved him [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1034.54s)]
*  Whatever he did the crowds loved him and then other people who are running against him and don't like him are treating him unfairly [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1036.9s)]
*  That's it when you have that in your mind everything else is pretty easy to talk about [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1043.82s)]
*  Well, I would just say that 70 year old Trump could keep all the shameless lies [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1048.98s)]
*  Oh, yeah, no together a little bit better and at this age. It's just like he can't even figure it out also [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1052.8999999999999s)]
*  What was he doing there with the Kamala Harris a woman? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1057.58s)]
*  Well, he's legitimately shocked. He got his ass kicked in the debate by a woman like he's never gonna get over that [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1061.6599999999999s)]
*  It's just I kept listening to that clip cuz I'm like is this one of those where liberals are like [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1066.7s)]
*  Look how sexist he was just blatantly and openly and misogynist [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1071.32s)]
*  But like no that I don't know what else he was trying to do there, but just say a woman [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1074.72s)]
*  I don't know how long that can last [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1079.76s)]
*  What is he doing in New York? I've tried to think about this and and figure this out [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1082.52s)]
*  Like what was he doing on Long Island? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1086.84s)]
*  I think he he needed after several tough weeks and the most boring town hall that Trump could ever do with Sarah [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1089.28s)]
*  Sanders in Michigan on Tuesday, he needed his people he needed a just a [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1097.06s)]
*  Confidence boost from a bunch of Long Islanders screaming his name in cheer. I really think that's what it was [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1102.7s)]
*  He's in a funk. I think he's in a funk and they're trying and the campaign's trying to pick him up [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1107.94s)]
*  It's just I do not believe he's there to win the house. I do not think that [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1112.14s)]
*  I don't think that makes a lot of sense [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1116.94s)]
*  I know that he's part of it is like his message, you know, like liberal blue America is a hellhole and [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1118.94s)]
*  It's crime-ridden and immigrant invasion and all that kind of stuff. But like I don't know you could do that in a swing state [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1127.14s)]
*  Maybe yeah, you could [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1134.26s)]
*  It's very weird [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1136.8600000000001s)]
*  You and I have talked before about how Trump strategy is is more about disqualifying Harris in the eyes of undecided voters than trying [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1138.38s)]
*  to win over new Trump voters [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1144.78s)]
*  do you think he's even making progress on that on tearing down Harris because [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1146.9s)]
*  This poll in Pennsylvania her favorability [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1151.8200000000002s)]
*  Keeps going up even where they're running all millions of dollars of ads super PAC ads all these ads are out [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1155.14s)]
*  He says crazy shit all the time. He's taking up news cycles. He's talking about eating the pets in Springfield [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1161.8200000000002s)]
*  He's doing all this shit, but it doesn't seem to be making the dent in her favorability or her poll numbers [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1167.3s)]
*  I guess it is depriving her of breaking through with her message, but I don't know. What do you think? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1173.94s)]
*  It seems to be an abject failure on all fronts [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1178.66s)]
*  But we've talked to from the moment Kamala Harris got in this race [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1181.26s)]
*  This was the rate we were there was now a race to define her who was gonna win Kamala Harris or Trump [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1183.98s)]
*  Her favorability rating is up a net 15 points since she got the race [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1190.34s)]
*  that's an astonishing increase over a short period of time for someone who was [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1194.74s)]
*  Not unknown. She was the vice president of states at the time. And so it is it is failing now [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1198.74s)]
*  There's still there's still another segment of voters like a slice of persuadable voters that they are both fighting over [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1204.8600000000001s)]
*  There's no evidence that he has damaged her with them yet, but there's not evidence that she has fully won them over yet. So [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1209.78s)]
*  In terms of defining her he has lost that battle [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1215.46s)]
*  But now we are down to the last group of voters in a small handful of states [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1217.78s)]
*  Most of those people have honestly not really checked into this election yet [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1221.3s)]
*  So we haven't even really contested them so that you know, that's what we'll sort of see that's who these ads that are running [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1224.74s)]
*  Like for instance the [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1230.5s)]
*  Kamala Harris abortion ad which ran during Survivor for instance, which we watched last night, obviously [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1232.82s)]
*  Or you know the Trump folks have a new ad about with Kamala Harris talking about by dynamics that is running all over the swing states [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1239.46s)]
*  Like though that they're trying to get to those voters by osmosis, but as a campaign strategy [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1246.02s)]
*  He has failed to put a debt in her numbers. Yeah [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1250.82s)]
*  One strategy Trump seems to be flirting with is an old favorite of his trying to shut down the federal government [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1254.82s)]
*  Mike Johnson's once again having trouble getting all his goofballs in line before the looming deadline of october 1st [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1258.98s)]
*  And even though mitch mcconnell just said quote [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1264.74s)]
*  It would be politically beyond stupid for us to do that right before the election because certainly we'd get the blame [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1267.06s)]
*  Donald trump begs to differ [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1273.06s)]
*  He wrote on truth social that republicans should only vote for a spending package that includes the save act [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1274.58s)]
*  Which imposes more requirements on states to make sure that non-citizens aren't registering to vote which of course doesn't really make sense [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1280.1s)]
*  Which of course doesn't really ever happen and is already illegal [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1287.3s)]
*  Um, it also by the way doesn't have the votes to pass congress [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1291.3s)]
*  clearly [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1294.8999999999999s)]
*  Trump and vance want to be able to say that the government shut down because [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1295.94s)]
*  Democrats refuse to require proof of citizenship to vote [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1299.9199999999998s)]
*  What do you think of that strategy? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1304.18s)]
*  That is a stupid person's idea of a smart plan [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1306.34s)]
*  Like it seems good on paper, but it would definitely not play out that way [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1310.4199999999998s)]
*  It's an absurd provision that is unnecessary makes no sense [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1313.94s)]
*  They'd be left out of town and we just know from history that the side that initiates the shutdown [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1317.6200000000001s)]
*  Gets the blame for the shutdown and that would be the house republicans who just happen to have [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1324.18s)]
*  13 [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1328.4s)]
*  Seats they are trying to defend they're either toss up or lean republican [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1329.7s)]
*  And so it seems like a terrible idea across the board [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1332.98s)]
*  And would obviously hurt people because when the government shuts down people are denied service needed services and money, etc [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1336.26s)]
*  But pure idiocy from them. Also you heard mitch mcconnell [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1343.3000000000002s)]
*  And there's a bunch of senate republicans that don't right they're all and every house republican is up has a campaign [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1347.38s)]
*  And every everyone that's in a competitive race every house republican every senate republican like they're not [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1354.1000000000001s)]
*  They're gonna be too happy [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1359.38s)]
*  uh with a uh [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1360.98s)]
*  government shutdown just like five weeks [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1362.74s)]
*  uh before the election that they're held responsible for because [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1366.1000000000001s)]
*  They wanted to pass something that no one [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1369.3000000000002s)]
*  Really is clamoring for [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1371.86s)]
*  No, something something that no one wants or needs. Yeah, yeah, right, right [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1374.18s)]
*  Uh, so I don't know. I I don't know. I would guess that when push comes to shove mike johnson [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1378.26s)]
*  Does what he always does and has to end up like passing something with the help of democrats and drops the save act and that's that [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1383.86s)]
*  But I mean they just kick the can down the road after the election [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1390.26s)]
*  That's what that's what it feels like but uh, nice to see trump getting involved there. Um, okay [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1392.74s)]
*  We got some absolutely bonkers news in north carolina to talk about lieutenant governor mark robinson currently the republican nominee for governor [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1397.46s)]
*  Is a well-known whack job who's flirted with holocaust denial [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1405.7s)]
*  Called lgbtq people filth and maggots called beyonce satanic and called michelle obama a man [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1409.7800000000002s)]
*  He also frequented the video booths of a porn shop five nights a week back in the early 2000s [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1416.02s)]
*  And yet somehow [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1420.98s)]
*  Andrew kozinski at cnn broke a story about him today [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1422.82s)]
*  That was so bad that it led north carolina republicans to try to get him off the ballot to get him to drop out [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1426.58s)]
*  last minute the deadline is [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1434.1799999999998s)]
*  Thursday midnight. We're recording this before you'll listen to this after so we'll see what happens. Um, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1436.58s)]
*  So what's the story apparently someone using an online alias that robinson himself often used? [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1441.78s)]
*  Uh with mark robinson's same birthday an email address was a frequent poster on the message board of a porn site [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1447.06s)]
*  called nude africa [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1453.86s)]
*  from 2008 to 2012 [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1456.02s)]
*  Among the highlights [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1459.3s)]
*  He told the message board that he loves porn featuring trans people [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1462.74s)]
*  I'm quoting him here quote. I like watching tranny on girl porn. That's fucking hot [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1466.5s)]
*  It takes the man out while leaving the man in and yeah, i'm a perv, too [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1471.7s)]
*  uh, it got more graphic and cnn actually [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1477.3s)]
*  Declined to print all of the details because they were too graphic. So what I just said was not the too graphic part [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1480.42s)]
*  um robinson also talked about uh being a kid and stumbling into a spot at a local university at a local university [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1487.6200000000001s)]
*  Where he could spy on women showering showering through a grate in the wall [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1494.02s)]
*  Robinson proudly referred to himself as a quote black nazi in another post and quote said [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1498.66s)]
*  Slavery is not bad. Some people need to be slaves. I wish they would bring it back. I would certainly buy a few [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1505.3799999999999s)]
*  And he called martin luther king jr. Quote worse than a maggot and quote a ho fucking phony [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1513.54s)]
*  Uh, so this is as good a place as any to remind you all that donald trump has endorsed robinson [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1519.22s)]
*  And often praises him. Uh, here's a helpful highlight reel that the harris campaign put together mark robinson. He's out there [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1524.6599999999999s)]
*  He's fighting a very good man. This is [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1531.62s)]
*  Martin luther king on steroids. I think you're better than martin luther king. I think you are [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1535.12s)]
*  Martin luther king times two. I think he's going to go down as one of the great leaders [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1541.3799999999999s)]
*  In our country where i've been with him a lot i've gotten to know him and he's outstanding. He's outstanding in presentation, but he's [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1546.74s)]
*  Probably even more outstanding and hard somebody that we have to be very very careful. We have to cherish [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1553.3799999999999s)]
*  We have to cherish mark. He's a star you have to cherish him [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1559.22s)]
*  It's like a fine wine because that's what you have you have a fine wine. He's an outstanding person [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1562.5s)]
*  I've gotten to know him so well and fairly quickly [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1567.86s)]
*  He's like he's a fine wine martin luther king martin luther king times two fine wine got to know him really well, um [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1574.1799999999998s)]
*  Before we get to trump, I want to put you on the record here. Do you regret your posts on new delaware? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1581.9399999999998s)]
*  Do not be smirked the state of delaware like that, okay, we've done enough to tell her the cycle. Yeah [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1586.8400000000001s)]
*  Back off my home state place. I'd love to return to one day. Um [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1595.24s)]
*  Robinson was already down in the polls to josh stein the democrat running for governor. Uh, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1599.24s)]
*  I'd imagine he'll fall even further behind now. Um, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1603.96s)]
*  Unless he because he caught himself a [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1607.88s)]
*  Nazi on a porn site black nazi [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1610.44s)]
*  Because he said he wants to bring back slavery and he'd buy a few on a porn site [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1612.7600000000002s)]
*  That's the thing these aren't things he posted on facebook. These are things he posted on a porn site message board [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1616.2s)]
*  um [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1620.5200000000002s)]
*  So first of all, I guess by the time again by the time you all listen to this we'll know what happened [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1621.48s)]
*  It doesn't seem like [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1625.64s)]
*  The republicans who want him out of the race are going to succeed at pushing him out of the race [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1627.3200000000002s)]
*  He and his campaign have said they're not going anywhere [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1630.92s)]
*  Uh, he said, you know, you can do strange things with the internet now [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1633.8000000000002s)]
*  He just thinks they're just denying it they're saying they're making it up, uh, they're saying that it was made up, uh, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1636.92s)]
*  Donald trump's campaign apparently told nbc news. Well, we're not trying to push him out [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1643.0s)]
*  Which is amazing to say [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1647.24s)]
*  So it seems like he's staying in unless something dramatically changes in the next. I don't know a couple hours. It's I mean [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1649.24s)]
*  You can't force him out. Yeah, you have to he has to decide to stay in the race [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1656.44s)]
*  I am [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1660.84s)]
*  not fully convinced at least some people around trump are not trying to get him out because [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1662.12s)]
*  North carolina is pulling better than georgia, which doesn't make a ton of sense demographically [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1666.84s)]
*  One of the main reasons that's the case is mark robinson's on the ballot [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1672.28s)]
*  And so if you get mark robinson off the ballot [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1676.68s)]
*  Theoretically, north carolina becomes a little bit easier [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1679.3s)]
*  For trump and so I don't know. It'll be interesting to see what happens here. Um [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1682.12s)]
*  And if he stays in the race it's gonna he is [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1688.36s)]
*  A zombie candidate, right? All the money dries up people stop campaigning for him [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1691.32s)]
*  He won't be seen with people be interesting. It'll be very interesting to see what happens when trump comes to the state [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1694.76s)]
*  Yeah, he'd be with mark robinson or not [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1699.16s)]
*  Also mark robinson at the republican convention was the one in the north carolina delegation that gave the uh, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1701.24s)]
*  Gave the announced the delegates for trump [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1707.32s)]
*  Here's what i'm trying to figure out like you could imagine a bunch of um, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1712.44s)]
*  uh [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1717.4s)]
*  trump stein voters, right they vote for the democrat for governor because [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1718.52s)]
*  These were for these republicans mark robinson's a bridge too far and then they vote for donald trump [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1722.52s)]
*  but like [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1727.9599999999998s)]
*  If robinson stays in the race in your [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1729.32s)]
*  the harris campaign [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1732.76s)]
*  like do you [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1734.4399999999998s)]
*  Run some ads like the one we just heard or just like the video we just heard or put some ads together with donald trump and mark [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1735.8s)]
*  robinson together and and try to uh, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1740.84s)]
*  Try to make this hurt trump a little bit in the state [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1743.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think you do. I think you tie trump to mark robinson's extremism and make them all extreme [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1747.08s)]
*  There's a we just did this in a forthcoming episode of political experts react [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1751.8s)]
*  Uh that did with chris hayes where we looked at josh stein's first ad about mark robinson [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1755.3999999999999s)]
*  Just using mark robinson's words so you can put the two of them together and you make it really about maga extremism [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1759.32s)]
*  Not just that he it's not that he called him one of the king times two or all of that is that they are [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1764.68s)]
*  uh birds of a feather, uh in terms of the extremism it's less the [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1769.8799999999999s)]
*  Porn site and the and the porn booths and all the other porn [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1774.76s)]
*  It's more the things he said about like threatening death to people and shooting people and all of the again the political violence [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1777.72s)]
*  black nazis slavery those are yeah go on whatever porn site you want to go on mark robinson, but that the [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1784.68s)]
*  Black that's the bridge too far for us. Yeah, right [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1790.5200000000002s)]
*  Um, okay. Well, we're going from north carolina one swing state to the other swing state of nebraska [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1793.0s)]
*  Actually, just the second congressional district. Um, if you're looking for reasons to worry about the race, here's one [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1799.72s)]
*  Um [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1805.8000000000002s)]
*  You may know that harris's most likely path to 270 runs through the second district of nebraska [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1807.0s)]
*  Um, it's one of only two states that splits its electoral votes if harris wins [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1813.0s)]
*  pennsylvania michigan [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1818.2800000000002s)]
*  wisconsin loses all the other battlegrounds but wins the nebraska second district she gets exactly 270 [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1819.7800000000002s)]
*  uh, but [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1827.88s)]
*  Nebraska republicans appear to be reviving their efforts to change the state law and make nebraska winner take all [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1829.24s)]
*  Which would deprive kamala harris of that electoral vote and then if she wins the blue wall [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1836.0400000000002s)]
*  It would be 269 269 [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1841.5600000000002s)]
*  And trump wins an electoral college tie because republicans have more state delegations in the house [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1844.0400000000002s)]
*  Uh, so lindsey graham of all people is helping to whip the votes there to make a change to make the change [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1851.5600000000002s)]
*  Uh unclear whether it's going to happen [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1856.76s)]
*  Also unclear whether maine the other state that splits its votes [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1859.08s)]
*  Could respond to deny trump the one electoral vote. He's likely to get in the main second congressional district though. It does seem like [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1863.48s)]
*  They will not have time to do that in maine [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1872.12s)]
*  Because apparently when you pass a law in maine takes 90 days to take effect [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1875.48s)]
*  90 days from now whoop pass the election [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1880.76s)]
*  uh, so [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1883.72s)]
*  Trouble in maine and it makes you wonder if the nebraska republicans waited this long [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1885.72s)]
*  just to sort of jam maine and make sure that didn't happen, but [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1890.44s)]
*  What what do you think? What's the latest on all this and how worried are you about this? [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1894.44s)]
*  I'm quite worried about this as you know, i've been worried about this for a long time. Yeah, i've just been under the [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1898.3600000000001s)]
*  Uh, my view has just been this was particularly when when it was biden trump that this was potentially game set match for trump [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1902.6000000000001s)]
*  If he were they were able to make this change [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1909.4s)]
*  What the governor has said is he's willing to call a special session meeting [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1912.3600000000001s)]
*  He needs the 33 republican senators necessary to pass it to be publicly in support of doing it [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1915.64s)]
*  They do not have the votes yet as far as we can tell some of the people who are in the meeting with graham [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1920.76s)]
*  uh [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1926.0400000000002s)]
*  and the governor say that they there was some progress in the meeting but so [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1927.0s)]
*  We will see like the they have to do this quickly too because they still have to print ballots, etc in um, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1931.88s)]
*  nebraska but [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1937.14s)]
*  I this this is one thing that will keep me up at night until it is fully resolved in a good way [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1939.7800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, so dave weigel had reported this at semaphore that one of the republicans that they would need [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1945.22s)]
*  As a former democrat left the party because he's anti-choice but wants to run [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1951.22s)]
*  To be mayor of omaha [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1956.5800000000002s)]
*  Um, which would be pretty hard to do if you piss off [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1958.66s)]
*  Uh everyone who's ever been a democrat [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1961.7800000000002s)]
*  By deciding to do this so again, they they still don't have the votes yet, but yeah when it comes down to um, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1964.66s)]
*  Everything depending on pressuring a few republicans in nebraska. It doesn't feel great. It doesn't feel good. Yeah [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1972.74s)]
*  All right [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1979.86s)]
*  So trump and harris were both hoping this week for an endorsement from the international brotherhood of teamsters the union's president sean o'brien had appeared [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1980.82s)]
*  The republican national convention uh in his meeting with kamala on tuesday was described as at tense at times [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1987.46s)]
*  But on wednesday the union announced it wouldn't be endorsing either candidate as part of the announcement the teamsters released the results of internal [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=1993.78s)]
*  Strap holes showing that members favored trump by more than 20 points [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2000.34s)]
*  After the announcement a handful of local teamsters chapters endorsed harris, but a million representing a million members altogether [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2004.18s)]
*  including in some of the key swing states [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2011.54s)]
*  How big of a deal do you think this is? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2014.18s)]
*  Uh, what do you make that internal straw poll showing that more teamsters favored trump than harris? Is it a big deal? [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2016.18s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2022.34s)]
*  I don't think it's as big a deal as people think [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2023.46s)]
*  the [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2025.46s)]
*  Back in the day when you would get a labor union endorsement would open up a spigot of money and organizing muscle [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2026.42s)]
*  That was truly truly mattered a lot in the battleground states. That's not really the case anymore [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2031.46s)]
*  The harris campaign has all the money they need they have a ton of organizing muscle [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2035.22s)]
*  The unions are not as powerful and flush with money as they used to be [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2038.74s)]
*  And having the endorsement of you know, the michigan and the western pennsylvania and these local teams whose unions matter more [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2042.66s)]
*  It is a little bit of a win for trump because he can continue to sort of live by this false [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2047.7s)]
*  Bullshit story that he is a you know, the working-class populace that he can win over these [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2052.42s)]
*  working-class voters in ways that democrats can't but [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2057.5400000000004s)]
*  I think it's probably there's probably a little more is being made if it necessarily needs to be [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2061.0600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think we'll hear about this story ever again [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2065.5400000000004s)]
*  And to our point earlier about like the voters who haven't decided yet [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2068.98s)]
*  They barely pay attention to politics like I just don't know that this is going to matter that much either way to them [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2072.5800000000004s)]
*  It's going to matter on the ground for like resources and people again [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2078.98s)]
*  But like if she has some of these teamsters in these key suing states [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2081.46s)]
*  That's very helpful in terms of organization and volunteers on the ground [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2084.42s)]
*  Speaking of labor strongholds kamala is in michigan [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2088.5s)]
*  Where she's about to do a live streamed event with oprah winfrey [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2091.38s)]
*  That's unfortunately happening a few hours after we record this [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2093.78s)]
*  The two are set to appear with a small live audience somewhere outside detroit that the campaign isn't saying where and it's being hosted in [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2096.82s)]
*  conjunction with a bunch of those [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2102.56s)]
*  Affinity groups that have held massive zoom calls for harris already win with black women white dudes for harris [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2104.56s)]
*  Cat ladies for kamala and others the new york times says governor gretchen whitmer will also be there [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2111.92s)]
*  What's the upside of an event like this? What what does it tell us about how the campaign is thinking about? [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2118.72s)]
*  Using this oprah endorsement which we first saw at the convention [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2124.32s)]
*  I think what's interesting is it says how the value that the harris campaign puts on organizing? [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2128.4s)]
*  And person-to-person contacts and so there's a way once you do this where it's like a big rally [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2134.32s)]

*  These are organizers at heart and this is a campaign that's thinking organizer first field first and using oprah for that is pretty smart [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2159.2s)]
*  Yeah, and getting people all excited and giving them sort of marching orders who are going to go like knock on the doors and stuff [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2166.48s)]

*  Tommy was talking about this on tuesday pod. It's this pro publica story. You should read it. It's just awful heartbreaking [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2214.56s)]

*  Thoughts on this very powerful messaging push [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2231.6s)]
*  Around reproductive freedom. It was one of the most powerful and frankly best testing messages [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2235.52s)]
*  From the debate was when she took a trump on on abortion and went through his record and what he would do [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2242.0s)]
*  And the the target here is very clear. It is [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2248.0s)]
*  It's women and particularly working-class women [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2251.2799999999997s)]
*  The folks at blueprint the center left research organization have a pullout of swing state non-college educated women today [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2254.0s)]
*  Which shows that what that this is a group that is favorable to camel harris and one of the ways in which [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2261.7599999999998s)]
*  You can get you can persuade these voters is on abortion. They opposed obs they oppose these abortion bans [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2266.16s)]
*  They trust her on abortion by seven points and more than 40 percent of them actually believe that if elected she would [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2271.2s)]
*  Not just try but pass a law restoring row. And so this is this is [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2278.64s)]
*  Really when you're trying to find they're all in a close election. There are all these groups you have to get but one [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2284.3199999999997s)]
*  targeted group where she can actually do better than biden is [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2289.12s)]
*  Working-class white women and that's exactly who this is targeted to [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2292.72s)]
*  I don't know if you saw this in the times poll too [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2296.7200000000003s)]
*  But there's now a plurality of voters who believe that donald trump will pass a national abortion ban [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2299.04s)]
*  So we had talked before about all the work the harris campaign first the biden campaign [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2305.44s)]
*  then the harris campaign needed to do in making voters understand that [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2309.6800000000003s)]
*  donald trump would actually go forward with this because they didn't necessarily believe that or didn't necessarily hold him responsible for daub's and [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2314.4s)]
*  That has started to change I think over the last couple months [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2320.88s)]
*  And now the question is if you're undecided if you think trump's better on the economy, but you [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2323.7599999999998s)]
*  Hear you see ads like this you hear testimonials like that. You read stories [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2330.16s)]
*  About like those mothers in georgia [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2335.44s)]
*  Um, if you do if you if you see all that do you think okay? [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2337.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, maybe trump's a little better in the economy or I think he's better in the economy [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2340.64s)]
*  But this just seems so extreme so scary. I don't want to live in this country [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2343.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't want my kids to live in this country [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2348.08s)]
*  I'll vote for kamala harris, even though i'm not sure that seems to be the bet and you could you could see that moving voters [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2350.16s)]

*  First of all, uh [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2479.6s)]
*  Uh, this wouldn't have happened if jeff probes had just shown a little bit of courage [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2481.92s)]

*  I'm gonna start with a compliment because there's gonna be a lot of jokes [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2504.64s)]
*  You did such a good job [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2507.52s)]
*  Not revealing at all the great poker face because everyone was like you guys genuinely shocked people were like you must have known [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2510.0s)]
*  I thought you won because you were so cocky about it. You were so happy the same thing [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2515.52s)]
*  I thought my my guess was that not that you won because then I think you would have been intolerable, right? [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2519.2s)]
*  Not that you won but also like you seemed so happy that i'm like [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2526.0s)]
*  I bet he just did he like he feels so good about how he did [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2529.04s)]
*  Which now makes sense because you you did you did great [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2532.08s)]
*  Sure, I think you were not embarrassed. I was not so that was the thing that was hard [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2535.6800000000003s)]
*  Like if I had come back and I had felt like what had happened was I blew my chance at survivor that like I was [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2539.6800000000003s)]
*  There and I was in it and I screwed it up. I think I would have been a little bit more reserved about the whole experience [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2546.0s)]
*  But I mean your taste in friends wasn't great. Sure, but but all of that like we got some questions about that [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2552.96s)]
*  no, and we should we can get into it, but like [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2558.48s)]
*  It's also like this is a this is a two-hour representation of 72 hours of of what happens [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2561.28s)]
*  And so like there's a lot that that like of other a lot we didn't see right [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2566.4s)]
*  There is a lot you didn't see you don't even know the real story. Yeah, but no, no, it's a fair edit [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2569.92s)]
*  it's a fair it's very I feel very comfortable with the edit, but um [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2573.36s)]
*  I don't feel like I [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2577.28s)]
*  like [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2579.12s)]
*  Like having now had the experience of watching an episode of reality tv in which you are on having no idea how they edit you [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2580.48s)]
*  Holy shit, that's nerve-racking. Yeah, I'm a little bit relieved. I don't have to I would I wish I had gone further [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2587.04s)]
*  But I feel like if you're gonna go out first [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2592.24s)]
*  This is a pretty reasonable way to do it. I just have two more things to say and then we I want to play a clip here [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2595.92s)]

*  Okay, so i'm old now. No, I really like mine. I like there's so much back in my day stuff [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2674.16s)]
*  Coming out of my mouth. I'm from los angeles. No, I started in weho where all the gays go [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2679.6s)]
*  I was a speed trainer for a while. Okay [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2685.7599999999998s)]
*  And then I started a podcast called pod save america [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2689.36s)]
*  Well, how many of you listen to it? I haven't [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2695.12s)]
*  So how many how many make me I feel like your podcast is huge, right? You're right [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2697.28s)]
*  What are you supposed to say? Do you not feel like your podcast is huge we do we do all right the I [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2704.2400000000002s)]
*  Fucking lost it. We're like pod save america. Has anyone listened and it was like no no [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2710.0s)]
*  One person said maybe maybe like it's like I love tick tock though. I think they did listen to it [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2715.84s)]
*  I think they did. I think they did keep in mind. There was another podcast host who had a podcast [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2721.28s)]
*  That was about survivor, but there's a scene in the in the in the after love it gets [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2727.28s)]
*  No, maybe maybe there's someone goes up to this podcast. He's like i'm a huge fan. She's a celebrity [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2732.48s)]
*  Great love it not the most famous [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2739.0400000000004s)]
*  I'm glad i'm glad i'm glad asia got her flowers. Um, just a basic question [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2743.6000000000004s)]
*  Why do you think you lost to the guy who had a physical and emotional meltdown? That's such an important question. Tommy [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2747.44s)]
*  Thank you, this guy's name is andy andy also described love it as his best friend [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2753.7599999999998s)]
*  Out magazine called your bond with him sweet and chaotic [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2758.56s)]
*  That's a real thing that's a real thing I saw on the internet today [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2763.44s)]
*  You know with friends like these so so once andy had his breakdown [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2767.8399999999997s)]
*  I think basically like it wasn't really about like who was friends or who wasn't friends like [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2771.3599999999997s)]
*  Andy had basically kind of imploded in front of 18 people all of whom now didn't need to worry about him as a threat [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2776.24s)]
*  And I had been kind of funny and charming in front of everybody and so I was in the other those were in the other scenes [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2781.84s)]
*  Yeah [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2787.36s)]
*  You got a lot of laughs a lot of laughs out of it [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2789.7599999999998s)]
*  And so it was famously andy bitching about how everyone clapped at you opening a coconut [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2792.4s)]
*  I opened a coconut and so opened one fucking coconut. Hey, I'm that's two coconuts you open [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2797.28s)]
*  Hey, hey listen you go to fiji and miss three dinners and then [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2806.64s)]
*  But but I do think that basically andy was no longer seen as a threat I was still seen as a threat and [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2812.4s)]
*  basically like because of the natural way it just broke down like there were no real [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2819.68s)]
*  alliances that early kind of very like kind of softly there were but like [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2824.38s)]
*  Andy and I had walked off one time. So suddenly we're together sam and sierra had walked off now there together rachel and anika were in the middle [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2828.24s)]
*  and so [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2835.28s)]
*  Once andy breaks down it just like put me in a really difficult position if that hadn't happened [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2836.88s)]
*  there was a bunch of different ways it could go one thing you don't see in the episode because [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2841.92s)]
*  It just has to be condensed is I also it had talked a lot with anika like she and I [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2845.68s)]
*  Really did want to work together and then that was sort of why [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2850.72s)]
*  andy pitched to me that we turned the vote on to her it was complicated but like [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2854.24s)]
*  There were a lot of different conversations [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2859.28s)]
*  There's like a swirl like there's hours of swirling conversation that happens before you go [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2860.88s)]
*  To the vote that they condense into one storyline. I don't think it's an unfaithful storyline that they showed [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2865.68s)]
*  But it is like more complicated than that [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2869.92s)]
*  Then your reality tv savant. What was your reaction watching? [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2871.92s)]
*  I would say this is the first two hours of survivor watching my life same [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2877.28s)]
*  It's really an hour and 45 minutes because I started 15 minutes late. Um, I turned my tv onto a mud covered love it trying to [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2881.92s)]
*  Which is when I started laughing I didn't stop I would say a couple things one [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2890.88s)]
*  I do this is something you care about like you obviously care about survivor a lot and you did put yourself out there [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2895.76s)]
*  So I think you get credit for that [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2899.6s)]
*  That's good. I think this is how you it's impressive. This is how you talk about joe biden's speeches [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2901.8399999999997s)]
*  He laughs he lasted longer than you [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2909.2799999999997s)]
*  That's right no one's talking about the secret service guys commander didn't bite [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2914.08s)]
*  To uh, you definitely got fucked by andy right? [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2919.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you would have not been you would have made it past first episode [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2923.52s)]
*  And I saw someone say in the discord which was a amusing conversation to follow along [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2927.36s)]
*  That you were either gonna win or go out on the first episode [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2932.2400000000002s)]
*  I think that is the perfect summary of how this was probably gonna go. Yeah, and that by the way that is what I told jeff [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2934.7200000000003s)]
*  When I talked to him for the first time about coming on the show [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2939.6s)]
*  I said I will either go to the end of this game or I will go home first [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2942.08s)]
*  So, uh, but hoisted my own guitar there. Yeah here's my question for you [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2945.76s)]
*  Because and I don't know anything about survivor. Why were you not on the puzzle team? What? Yeah, what the hell? [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2950.32s)]
*  so [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2955.92s)]
*  there is [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2957.04s)]
*  A you're just breast stroking out to the yeah [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2958.2400000000002s)]
*  I want to ask why you were doing the breaststroke in the swimming challenge. I should have practiced [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2960.64s)]
*  I should have practiced swimming more but um [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2966.0s)]
*  Everybody caught me doing the breaststroke. I didn't realize I was doing the breaststroke. Emily noticed it immediately. She's her first question. Uh, [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2969.04s)]
*  I should have maybe jumped in on the second puzzle, but basically [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2975.92s)]
*  uh [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2979.76s)]
*  the [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2981.04s)]
*  They didn't they didn't show it but like in the first puzzle [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2981.92s)]
*  I like was called I was helping from the side and we had talked about it because you have a moment to strategize before [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2985.04s)]
*  And we had talked about it and was like, oh the puzzle pieces are big sam is stronger sam [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2991.04s)]
*  Should can lift the pieces love it. Well john you'll help call from the side and they just don't include everything that happens [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=2995.36s)]
*  The older more mature brain behind the operation. Yeah. Yeah, I'm a delegator that looks brutally as a math major [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3001.2000000000003s)]
*  You would have helped them do the puzzle much better but you're trying to the puzzle terribly and terribly you would have shown value [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3008.24s)]
*  Thanks to your tribe. No for sure aside in addition to the coconut of course sports reporter guy. Yeah [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3013.84s)]
*  Armchair quarterback down the charm, but no, I think the actual fuck up on the puzzle. It was [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3020.24s)]
*  Wasn't actually our family to do the puzzle [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3025.52s)]
*  The completed puzzle was sitting next to us because the red tribe had completed their puzzle [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3027.92s)]
*  Why are we why are we not used we didn't we were so focused on? [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3033.44s)]
*  What was happening in front of us? We didn't stop we were so it's the first challenge. Everybody is super amped [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3037.52s)]
*  That's why the boat's all turned over. You're just not fully [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3042.64s)]
*  Thinking you're nervous. You're already tired. It's hot [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3045.68s)]
*  You've never been in this sort of environment before and I think if we'd all taken a beat we would have looked over and been like [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3049.2s)]
*  Wait a second. Why are we not using this? [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3053.68s)]
*  Fully completed puzzle to figure out this puzzle [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3056.24s)]
*  I was amazed at how physically taxing this looked like picking up those giant boxes swimming to a dock the breaststroke [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3058.64s)]
*  And then loading those heavy boxes onto a boat that kept capsizing [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3065.7599999999998s)]
*  Meanwhile, you got like a coked up barry's instructor jeff pros barking orders you screaming like this is survivor [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3068.88s)]
*  It's like this is always the worst start we've ever had by the way what you saw [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3075.6s)]
*  What we were in the water for so long? [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3080.24s)]
*  uh lava the red tribe had completed their uh [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3083.68s)]
*  Completed their puzzle for so long before we had even gotten up there [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3088.32s)]
*  There was a moment where there were two tribes [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3092.32s)]
*  All of our boxes floating all of our boats upside down and I really was like what happens like we made nothing [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3094.88s)]
*  Nothing nothing is happening. No one could figure out what to do [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3100.64s)]
*  And then because everything is all waterlogged we get the boat up onto the beach [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3103.04s)]
*  We get the boat up into the tracks we get the the chest back into the boat [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3106.88s)]
*  We all go to heave the boat down this path and it barely even showed [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3112.2400000000002s)]
*  And it just doesn't move like we all push as hard as we can [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3116.16s)]
*  And it doesn't move like a foot or an inch it just doesn't move at all [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3119.2000000000003s)]
*  And there was this moment like we're just not going to be able to complete this thing [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3122.88s)]
*  And then eventually we fight and we fight and we get it to the end [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3125.76s)]
*  God looks hard. It was hard. It was hard. It was cool [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3129.36s)]
*  Uh, are you at all annoyed at cbs that they put you in all the early promo materials and jeff probes called you quote [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3132.32s)]
*  One of the greatest storytellers that we will ever have, uh knowing full well the outcome [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3138.7200000000003s)]
*  Uh, no, I enjoy being part of a bait and switch [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3144.08s)]
*  But also like I [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3147.44s)]
*  Like I think that they were pretty disappointed that I went home this or like I think he really liked you [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3149.44s)]
*  He liked me. I think he was really that's a social connection you made for sure. Yeah, there's one [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3155.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, one guy had a vote because he doesn't step in there and get together a slate of delegates [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3161.6800000000003s)]
*  Get a fucking better slate. I don't trust these people. Did you see the counting of the ballots something happened? [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3166.7200000000003s)]
*  There was a duffel under the table, but the [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3171.36s)]
*  But I do think they were genuinely [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3173.84s)]
*  Disappointed that I didn't go further and I do take that as a compliment speaking of the counting the ballots [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3175.98s)]
*  Did it upset you that everyone spelled your name wrong or the tribal council? Not even one look it upset me as a fellow j-o-n [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3180.6400000000003s)]
*  Here's the thing one of the things the frowny face [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3186.5s)]
*  It's not exactly a sign of confidence [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3188.7200000000003s)]
*  If you go around to people and explain how to spell your name before tribal council, and by the way [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3190.2400000000002s)]
*  If you're gonna write don't write my fucking name down, you don't go around saying there's no h and john [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3194.4s)]
*  What kind of signal does that send? [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3198.32s)]
*  Uh, what can you tell us about where you went after the vote? [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3201.28s)]
*  Uh, so you go to ponderosa [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3204.2400000000002s)]
*  This is publicly known. It's uh, it's basically like they take over a hotel and you stay there [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3206.6400000000003s)]
*  there is [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3212.5600000000004s)]
*  Uh the pre-jury time and there's the jury time [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3214.0s)]
*  We was obviously not pre not jury and you basically are isolated. You don't have your phone. You don't have anything [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3217.0400000000004s)]
*  and [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3223.2000000000003s)]
*  You just sort of [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3226.4s)]
*  Basically like kind of have be on vacation be on vacation while you guys are making the pods day in and day out work into the bone [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3228.24s)]
*  And you're in the minds like three production days [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3236.16s)]
*  for six weeks of work [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3240.16s)]
*  Um, check out just wanted to make that was one thing that crossed my mind [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3242.64s)]
*  Well, you know and and and I understand why you might be cross about it by the [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3246.24s)]
*  And obviously no one was more disappointed than me [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3252.56s)]
*  But it's not like I could come back and do the podcast because then everyone would find out that I got out [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3255.6s)]
*  So there was nothing to be done. No, there wasn't a ton going on here though [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3259.52s)]
*  Okay, right. Okay. I'll forgive you some spin. Sure [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3263.3599999999997s)]
*  That would be helpful. I've just completed a day of press about it [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3266.88s)]
*  But yeah, no, what do you got? [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3269.44s)]
*  You go on a show like survivor because it's a great story and getting booted out first is a much better story than getting booted [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3270.24s)]
*  Out second on third to last totally agree. Okay third to last is pretty cool [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3276.4s)]
*  I would have a lot of stories. I would actually second is the worst [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3281.04s)]
*  Because you don't have the you're not the first boot person and you're the same like yes, I would say I am glad [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3285.2799999999997s)]
*  I well now here's the thing that's interesting. Is that like so you go to ponderosa and then [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3291.7599999999998s)]
*  Every day or two [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3297.52s)]
*  A person comes and joins you. Oh, that's cool. And it's it's nice. It's really interesting, right? [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3299.2s)]
*  So the first day you're kind of in you're a little bit shocked. You're there by yourself and then hey andy [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3303.68s)]
*  Then you well see you then you well, i'm not gonna say [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3309.52s)]
*  Who comes now? [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3312.4s)]
*  Then you're sitting there and then [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3314.6400000000003s)]
*  You're now kind of gotten over it based not over it [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3316.6400000000003s)]
*  But you're like kind of like past the first bit of like oh, I just got voted out [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3318.96s)]
*  And then this shell-shocked person comes down the stairs. You don't know who it is till they arrive and you're like, uh, [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3322.2400000000002s)]
*  This is not my job to expend emotional labor [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3327.44s)]
*  helping you [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3330.8s)]
*  No, but what's interesting about it is like, you know [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3332.88s)]
*  everybody who gets voted out a survivor myself included like you start telling a story that like [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3335.6000000000004s)]
*  Is the best version that you can tell that's believable that makes you feel better about what happened you're part of that right now [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3340.16s)]
*  but [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3345.52s)]
*  but but in those first few moments when somebody comes off [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3346.56s)]
*  they're like [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3350.08s)]
*  Raw and they just start talking about what they did wrong what other people do what they feel bad about what they regret [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3351.52s)]
*  And so you get like you're like one more poo poo platter, please [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3356.48s)]
*  Um, yeah, listen jeff [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3362.16s)]
*  Poopoo platter [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3365.3599999999997s)]
*  I the other the the funny thing too is with each passing day with each passing day the people that come are skinnier and skinnier [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3367.44s)]
*  Yeah, and hungrier and hungrier [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3374.0s)]
*  But you can't really you can't really eat that much because you haven't eaten in days [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3375.76s)]
*  And so basically you watch somebody just sit in front of a full cheese pizza and just sort of take a bite of it [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3379.36s)]
*  You're gonna eat that as you're crying [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3385.76s)]
*  Yeah, no, no, no. Yeah, they really fucked you. I've been here a week now [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3388.7200000000003s)]
*  I [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3392.64s)]
*  What did you do all day when you were you had no internet so I did read books I read books [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3395.2s)]
*  I read a bunch of books [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3400.64s)]
*  Basically, I I would yes [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3401.92s)]
*  I would work out there was a playstation 5 and even though they wouldn't let me log into my playstation 5 account because it would [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3403.6s)]
*  Connect me to a messaging app. I am able to use yes [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3409.7599999999998s)]
*  I was able to I was they had a couple games. So I played video games for part of the day. I read [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3413.3599999999997s)]
*  by the pool for part of the day eight [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3418.96s)]
*  Just like eight all the time. It's like being on a cruise. You're just like there's just a constant supply of food [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3421.68s)]
*  I haven't had a vacation day in a year and then uh, okay [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3426.4s)]
*  All right, you just used it to tweet about joe biden [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3430.64s)]
*  Can we get can we get [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3433.44s)]
*  That was your choice. I had some I had some coconut [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3435.68s)]
*  This guy over here [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3440.3199999999997s)]
*  uh, but so [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3441.44s)]
*  Yeah, so you're just kind of hanging out all day and then as people come people just really want to talk about what happened [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3443.04s)]
*  And then uh, so it gets more fun [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3446.96s)]
*  But what's in but anyway you like really get a perspective on the game that you don't normally get from people how they talk about [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3448.48s)]
*  It once they're in interviews [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3453.44s)]
*  They're really kind of honest about what went wrong for them and that was a really cool [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3454.6400000000003s)]
*  It didn't it made me want to point it out [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3458.1600000000003s)]
*  Well, I was gonna ask so you you said in the exclusive teaser [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3460.4s)]
*  We listened to on monday for tuesday show that survivor is an election an experiment in democracy is your experiment in democracy over [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3463.12s)]
*  Listen [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3474.8s)]
*  I'm sorry [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3477.04s)]
*  Nice job oprah. Yeah [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3478.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm gonna recap pot. Uh, I am not um, i'm not ready to give up on democracy just yet. All right [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3480.8s)]
*  Just like trump, you know, you win some you lose some you don't walk away from democracy. Tommy just because you lost an election [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3486.96s)]
*  Storm that yeah, you go you grab a torch you grab a torch and you you start threatening [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3493.2000000000003s)]
*  Meet me at the ponderosa will be wild [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3500.8s)]
*  Oh [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3506.88s)]
*  In what way was this not worth it this is so fun [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3514.2400000000002s)]
*  My text to love it last night was that was an incredibly enjoyable experience that I shall never forget and I am so grateful to you [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3517.36s)]
*  For giving it to us and I genuinely mean every word of that and I really wish I'd gone further [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3524.56s)]
*  But the fact that I now like the nervousness before seeing what they decided to use or not use [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3530.2400000000002s)]
*  I am so relieved if I wasn't gonna go far. I'm glad i'm home now [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3536.16s)]
*  Also, if you did go far, there's so much more footage and so many more things to worry about saying like I fell out of a boat [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3540.64s)]
*  You fell out of that could have been in there [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3547.44s)]
*  You gave us all everyone fell out of the boat [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3549.44s)]
*  You gave us the gift of for those of us who wanted to watch you but not necessarily those other people and other tribes [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3551.6s)]
*  This was a gift. It was very enjoyable and it was fun, but I have to I do have to say you have to keep watching [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3556.16s)]
*  Oh [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3562.0s)]
*  Oh dandas [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3562.88s)]
*  I actually I have to say I came in skeptical of the show itself. I kind of liked it [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3564.96s)]
*  Yeah, i'm gonna i'm gonna watch it. Just the root against andy for the rest of the guy [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3569.52s)]
*  Critique of the show itself. I will say i've only watched the first season so i've missed out on survivor [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3573.12s)]
*  You kind of you can't just jump into a season because there's a lot of like I know [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3578.4s)]
*  I know things that are happening that you're running through the woods. You have no idea fucking digging up boxes with locks [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3583.12s)]
*  By the way, that's where so that was another thing like when I got back after the [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3590.08s)]
*  Immunity challenge. I really did think like well [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3594.88s)]
*  My options now are to hustle and try to get the votes off of me and onto somebody else the challenge there though is [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3597.12s)]
*  There's something called shots in the dark. Do you guys know what shots in the dark? [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3604.08s)]
*  I googled it today. So a shot in the dark basically everybody starts out with basically [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3606.4s)]
*  um [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3611.36s)]
*  A one in six you have it's like a die. It's like a and and you put it into a box [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3612.2400000000002s)]
*  And you basically have a one in six chance. It's a dice [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3617.04s)]
*  It's a it's a it's a roll of the dice and you have a one in six chance of getting to stay if you play your shot [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3618.7200000000003s)]
*  In the dark, but you lose your vote. The reason it exists is basically so that [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3622.72s)]
*  If you're sure you're going home [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3627.3599999999997s)]
*  You can play it but that means people have to persuade you that they're not voting for you [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3629.7599999999998s)]
*  Even if they are it's a way to get out of situations that would happen in the past where everybody knew it was rick [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3633.4399999999996s)]
*  And rick knew it was rick and there was nothing anybody could do it sort of made it boring [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3639.2799999999997s)]
*  So to make it more interesting that everyone's kind of has to lie [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3642.56s)]
*  But what that means is everyone's telling me it's andy I can tell that they're not telling me the truth [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3645.04s)]
*  But how do you persuade somebody to vote for someone they're already telling you they're voting for it [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3650.24s)]
*  Like it's one thing if somebody comes up to you and says they're voting for trump [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3654.48s)]
*  But it's another for them to lie to you and say they're voting for kamala [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3657.52s)]
*  You can't persuade them because they're telling you I already agree with you [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3660.48s)]
*  So there was so it just made it really hard. And so I thought about like should I go chase down a beware advantage? [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3663.2s)]
*  But as you all saw it's so many steps and I didn't know if i'd be able to complete the steps in time [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtQ6a5Mfu8U&t=3668.96s)]
