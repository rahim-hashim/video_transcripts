Video Description: Donald Trump dresses up like a sanitation worker as a message stunt and says he'll "protect" women "whether the women like it or not." Kamala Harris seizes on those remarks in events in the swing states, sharpening her argument against Trump on abortion and health care. In the final Friday episode before Election Day, Jon and Dan discuss all the latest and what they're watching for in each of the battleground states on Tuesday. Then, Nebraska's independent Senate candidate, Dan Osborn, talks with Dan about how he's pulled even with the Republican incumbent in one of the reddest states in the country, and how he plans to win.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Kamala Harris Hits Donald Trump Over Creepy Comments About Women
**Pod Save America:** [November 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA)
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Jon Favreau. I'm Dan Pfeiffer on today's show with the election just days away [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=0.0s)]
*  Whoo days away Dan [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=6.48s)]
*  with the election just days away the Trump campaign closes with [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=9.72s)]
*  Sanitation worker cosplay and a full embrace of anti-vax conspiracy theories [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=13.52s)]
*  Kamala Harris prepares to rally with Cardi B and continues to hit Trump on abortion and health care and [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  Because it's our final Friday show before Election Day [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=25.8s)]
*  You and I are gonna take a look at the battleground map Dan and talk about what we're watching for on Tuesday [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=30.96s)]
*  You know what I'm watching for more votes from Kamala Harris done. We've done the segment. Let's let's wrap this up with the outro [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=36.48s)]
*  And then after that Nebraska independent Senate candidate Dan Osborne stops by to talk about how he's fought to a tie in one of the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=43.980000000000004s)]
*  reddest states in America [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=51.72s)]
*  And what you can do to help but first Donald Trump showed up at one of his final rallies [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=54.199999999999996s)]
*  Dressed as a garbage truck driver and delivered a compelling argument to undecided women [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=59.72s)]
*  And my people told me about four weeks ago. I was saying no I want to protect the people [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=64.88s)]
*  I want to protect the women of our country. They said sure [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=69.68s)]
*  I just think it's inappropriate for you to say pay these guys a lot of money. Can you believe it? I said well [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=72.48s)]
*  I'm gonna do it whether the women like it or not [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=78.48s)]
*  Is there any woman in this stadium that wants to be protected by the president? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=81.4s)]
*  No, thank you [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=87.84s)]
*  Of course Kamala Harris jumped all over this first at a press conference and then during her rally in Phoenix on Thursday [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=90.28s)]
*  Let's listen and Donald Trump's not done. Did everyone hear what he just said yesterday [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=96.68s)]
*  That he will do [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=102.28s)]
*  What he wants quote and here's where I'm gonna quote whether the women like it or not [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=104.28s)]
*  He does not believe women should have the agency and authority [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=111.39999999999999s)]
*  To make decisions about their own bodies [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=117.52s)]
*  This is the same man who said women should be punished for their choices [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=120.72s)]
*  He simply does not respect the freedom of women [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=128.44s)]
*  Or the intelligence of women to know what's in their own best interest and make decisions [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=134.24s)]
*  accordingly, but we trust women so [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=141.8s)]
*  Obviously in the closing days [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=145.8s)]
*  There's a whole bunch of things you can choose to make news on if you're the Harris campaign, especially with Trump he and his [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=148.04000000000002s)]
*  Goons have given plenty of material to the truth of the Harris campaign [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=157.32000000000002s)]
*  Over the last week, but they chose they chose this comment about women [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=162.76s)]
*  Protecting them whether they like it or not. What does it tell you that the campaign saw an opportunity there? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=169.76s)]
*  I think it's three things one just tactically you want to be on offense for every minute of [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  This campaign because of the Madison Square Garden rally some other things Trump has said and done recently [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=179.52s)]
*  there is this sort of emerging narrative of I [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=184.52s)]
*  Don't know why it's emerging everybody it is in the press coverage of this cycle of [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=187.44s)]
*  Trump saying outlandish things that are politically damaging to him that makes it and then when you write and the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=190.56s)]
*  conversation is looks like Kamala Harris is ascendant and Trump is [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=196.68s)]
*  Crap in the bed. And so that's one two is obviously this has tremendous echoes of Dobbs and everything [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=201.16s)]
*  That's in project 2025 about abortion and women's reproductive freedom and women's health care [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=207.92s)]
*  This is a chance to go with that and the third thing isn't it dovetails with [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=212.32000000000002s)]
*  you with some polling that I've seen that clue the Harris campaign is seen as well because it shows up in some of their [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  more recent ads is this idea of [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=221.72s)]
*  Extremists like Donald Trump with total control unchecked power controlling your lives [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=224.84s)]
*  Really resonates with a real segment of voters and one of the one of the groups the Harris campaign is courting at the end here [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=229.72s)]
*  We talk a lot about these Haley Republicans bulwark Republicans is I think Tim Miller called them on the Wednesday pod [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=235.08s)]
*  but there's also a subset of that group which are [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=241.52s)]
*  working-class white women who [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=245.12s)]
*  disagree who may have some disagreements with Kamala Harris on some issues particularly some cultural issues but [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=248.44000000000003s)]
*  Firmly disagree with the Dobbs decision and these Republican abortion bans and that is a target audience here in the final days [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=254.44000000000003s)]
*  Well, and it's it's pretty clear by now that it's not just Trump who's stepping in it [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=260.52000000000004s)]
*  With women and his comments about abortion and his record on abortion [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=266.5s)]
*  it's a lot of his bros too, so [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=272.02s)]
*  We have a supercut of [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=275.32s)]
*  JD Vance who sat down with Joe Rogan today, I guess for four hours [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=277.41999999999996s)]
*  And then and then you're gonna hear Charlie Kirk who's basically running Trump's ground operation [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=282.62s)]
*  Or helping to run helping Elon run Trump's ground operation their forces combined and then you're gonna hear my pal Jesse Waters [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=288.94s)]
*  Listen at the very best if you grant I think every argument of the pro-choice side [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=296.02s)]
*  It is a neutral thing not something to be celebrated. I think there's very few people that are celebrating. I think it's so just [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=300.98s)]
*  Nauseating where this wife is wearing the you'll show it wearing the American hat [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=308.42s)]
*  She's coming in with her sweet husband who probably works his tail off to make sure that she can go [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=311.94s)]
*  You know and have a nice life and provide to the family and then she lies to him saying oh [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=316.97999999999996s)]
*  Yeah [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=321.32s)]
*  I'm gonna vote for Trump and then she votes for Kamala Harris as her little secret in the voting booth [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=321.41999999999996s)]
*  Kamala Harris and her team believe that there will be millions of women that undermine their husbands [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=325.14s)]
*  And do so in a way that it's not detectable in the polling [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=330.09999999999997s)]
*  And if I found out Emma was going into the voting booth and pulling the lever for Harris [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=333.29999999999995s)]
*  That's the same thing as having an affair [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=339.21999999999997s)]
*  that [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=341.97999999999996s)]
*  Let him finish your [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=344.78000000000003s)]
*  The sanctity of our marriage, I don't know why your friends with that why are you friends with that guy Emma? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=349.14000000000004s)]
*  vote Harris [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=355.78000000000003s)]
*  Wherever you are in the middle there Charlie Kirk was referencing this [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=357.18s)]
*  Harris campaign ad that Julia Roberts [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=362.74s)]
*  It does the the voiceover and it's these these women are walking to the voting booth and there's a husband there, too [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=365.78000000000003s)]
*  And he's obviously like a Trumper [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=372.4s)]
*  she goes into the booth and she like looks at another woman and she sort of just [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=374.67999999999995s)]
*  she votes for Harris and the other one votes for Harris and they give they exchange a knowing look and [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=378.23999999999995s)]
*  Conservatives are outraged about this ad. I don't think and then of course there's JD van saying that women are [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=383.2s)]
*  It's it's too much that women are celebrating the Dobbs decision because they think it's politically advantageous to them [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=389.67999999999995s)]
*  And then Joe Rogan's like I don't think people are celebrating [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=395.34s)]
*  I don't know if any of that's gonna help with women [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=399.03999999999996s)]
*  I don't know. What do you think? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=401.72s)]
*  Doesn't seem that way in its or with men frankly that that was really interesting part [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=404.96000000000004s)]
*  I only saw the clips. I did not I've not buckled up for the four-hour Joe Rogan JD Vance podcast yet [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=410.32000000000005s)]
*  Do not intend to [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=415.76000000000005s)]
*  but the way that Rogan in the clips that I saw went after JD Vance on [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=417.64000000000004s)]
*  Dobbs and particularly the idea that some of these states would prosecute women for [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=425.08000000000004s)]
*  Traveling to states where abortion is legal to have abortions [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=429.76s)]
*  does speak to that we think of Dobbs entirely or too often I guess primarily in the context of how it is motivating women to [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=433.44s)]
*  Vote for Kamala Harris. I just mentioned these working-class white women, but [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=441.82s)]
*  Young men too, right and there have been some ads that addresses some of those ads are pretty bad [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=445.91999999999996s)]
*  But there are ads and if you remember when Dobbs happened one of the people who came out and spoke [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=449.71999999999997s)]
*  most aggressively about it was [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=454.44s)]
*  Dave Portnoy the founder of barstool sports and sort of the he is the leader of [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=456.71999999999997s)]
*  The manosphere in a lot of ways along with Joe Rogan [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=461.44s)]
*  And so yeah, I don't think this is helping with women and I don't think actually a focus on Dobbs helps them with anyone [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=463.96s)]
*  I think that is purely purely bad for the Republicans [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=468.92s)]
*  Yeah, and JD van saying that I haven't heard of any of this like there's states all over the place now red states that are [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=472.24s)]
*  considering passing legislation [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=479.52s)]
*  So that women can't even go over state lines to get abortion Ken Paxton the Attorney General of Texas is [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=480.88s)]
*  currently [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=487.4s)]
*  Has a lawsuit to try to get private medical information from women to see if they've gone over state lines to get abortion [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=488.35999999999996s)]
*  Which Liz Cheney brought up in one of her events with Kamala Harris [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=495.67999999999995s)]
*  Even though Liz Cheney has said that she's you know been pro-life for you know, most of her career [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=499.28s)]
*  so I do think that like the extreme consequences of Dobbs and sort of the level of [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=503.76s)]
*  Control that the government now has over women women's lives [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=510.44s)]
*  people trying to plan families [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=515.68s)]
*  medical care that women desperately need if they're miscarrying or [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=518.4399999999999s)]
*  It's just I think it's resonating. It has resonated with a lot of people has since 2022 and [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=522.4s)]
*  I don't think closing I don't think closing on that is what the Trump campaign wants necessarily [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=528.28s)]
*  we talked a lot about earlier in this campaign about [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=534.36s)]
*  Issue salience and what issues are in voters minds or they make the decision the economies in most people's minds [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=537.7199999999999s)]
*  But there have been there has been this battle and for the number two slot between [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=541.9599999999999s)]
*  immigration and abortion and during the peak of the surge of the border and the migrants showing up being bus to towns [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=545.36s)]
*  Immigration became the strong. There's number two issue by far [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=551.88s)]
*  It's been about tide recently and if you have a law I can't retract a conversation about Dobbs over the last few days [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=554.52s)]
*  Inches up a pointer to here and some of these states that could be the difference [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=560.88s)]
*  There's been a lot of focus on Trump's apparent polling gains with younger men [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=564.4399999999999s)]
*  But much less on Harris's and Democrats advantage with women [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=569.3199999999999s)]
*  Which we've seen show up in polls and election results more importantly since Dobbs [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=574.28s)]
*  Do you buy that we may be headed for the biggest gender gap ever as you see in some analyses? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=580.12s)]
*  It seems very possible. They're gonna if not the largest we will have a historic gender gap [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=587.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's happening in part because [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=592.2s)]
*  It's it's two ways right gender gap happens because you have movement both directions [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=595.12s)]
*  But we are if the polls are correct, right? Which is the the question looms over everything we say and think [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=598.26s)]
*  You are seeing a huge surge of young women Jen's millennial and Gen Z women to Kamel Harris [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=604.84s)]
*  But you were seeing Trump make gains with Gen Z men over what Biden in previous Democrats had gotten [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=611.0400000000001s)]
*  So if you have those two things, you're gonna end up with the largest gender gap [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=617.8000000000001s)]
*  It's always hard to tell in these poll in the polling and particularly [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=621.3000000000001s)]
*  There's been some good large sample youth polls like the Harvard poll for instance and NBC did one as well [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=623.98s)]
*  But a lot of these polls if you take the under 29 group and then you slice it in half [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=629.74s)]
*  You're looking at margin of error of like nine sometimes more [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=634.3000000000001s)]
*  And so it's sometimes hard to get into if you don't break it down by age and you just do what is the gender gap? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=636.86s)]
*  between women and men so [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=642.98s)]
*  2020 [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=645.62s)]
*  Women went for Biden by about 12 points 56 43 [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=646.9s)]
*  That's like, you know catalyst pew those are sort of months after the election [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=651.1s)]
*  They get the best read on what happened and then so that was 12 points and then men went for Trump by 52 46 [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=655.46s)]
*  That's about four points, right? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=662.46s)]
*  So far the polls right now because I was looking at the average of all the cross tabs for all the gender splits [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=664.1s)]
*  Women Harris is winning by about 10 points 53 43. So still still smaller than the Biden [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=671.0600000000001s)]
*  Margin with women and then men so far Trump is 52 44 around eight points [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=678.48s)]
*  So it is it's actually not bigger right now at least according to the polls, but that these are the polls [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=684.0799999999999s)]
*  These are not the sort of final results [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=690.0799999999999s)]
*  So I do wonder that if like, you know [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=691.8s)]
*  All of the what we're hearing on the ground everything we've seen in 20 elections in 22 and 23 [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=695.3s)]
*  If that bears out will those with the with the especially among women will that gap will that margin get bigger for? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=701.6800000000001s)]
*  Harris and then that might help, you know push her over the edge. That's that's what we got to see on Tuesday, but [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=709.16s)]
*  There's been a lot of tea leaf reading of the early vote data in terms of gender breakdown [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=715.96s)]
*  Should we just continue to ignore that early vote? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=722.24s)]
*  Early early vote anecdotes people are writing stories about it and Politico and Dempsey signs of optimism [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=725.5600000000001s)]
*  With gender and early vote. I don't know. I don't I don't want to indulge. Yeah, it's I [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=731.9200000000001s)]
*  Think the one person who I think is worth listening to on the early vote is John Ralston from Nevada [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=737.28s)]
*  And I would say I say that even though his reports for Democrats are not good, right? He but [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=743.32s)]
*  There's a lot going on here that makes the early vote confusing [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=750.8000000000001s)]
*  You only know party breakdown and that's not even in every state of how many Democrats how many Republicans voted? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=754.76s)]
*  Another thing that is can there is no benchmark to compare things to because 2020 was incredibly unique and since 2020 [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=761.0s)]
*  Republicans have started voting earlier and you've seen a lot of [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=768.08s)]
*  tried and true stalwart Republican Election Day voters just vote early and [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=771.76s)]
*  So for people like you and I and reporters covering it, we don't know a ton of information [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=776.5600000000001s)]
*  The campaigns however, and I think it's worth explaining after you vote [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=781.76s)]
*  Your name is now public as having voted doesn't say who you voted for or for whom you voted [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=786.0s)]
*  But it is public the campaign takes all information the campaign has a model [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=790.2800000000001s)]
*  For everyone listening to this with the United States the campaign has a model for you. They have two models [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=795.4000000000001s)]
*  They have a support score and a turnout score and that's based on your vote history [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=799.8000000000001s)]
*  It's both based on your partisan registration [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=803.44s)]
*  It's both on what that any demographic and in geographic information they have and if you live in a battleground state [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=806.0s)]
*  It's probably based on some consumer data. They have purchased to understand [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=810.56s)]
*  that the old days would be the magazines you subscribe to would be if the information you use in this day might be the [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=815.2399999999999s)]
*  websites or the things you buy and stuff like TV shows you watch stuff like that and [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=820.1199999999999s)]
*  And then so they rate you on how likely you are to vote for Kamala Harris [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=824.8s)]
*  From a campus score of 1 to 10 and how likely are you to vote from score 1 to 10? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=828.5999999999999s)]
*  And so the campaigns know in the states [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=832.92s)]
*  If as pluffy the very evocative phrase pluff use of an army of incels are turning out for Trump [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=836.4s)]
*  They know if we are getting our lower propensity voters turning out and the big mystery is the campaign has a support score for the [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=842.04s)]
*  independent or nonpartisan [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=850.32s)]
*  Voters, but they don't know for sure who they're actually for for sometimes that support score is [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=852.24s)]
*  Six right so you don't really know for sure what they're gonna do [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=857.16s)]
*  And so even the campaigns don't have a ton of information and they won't know whether their model is right until [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=861.5600000000001s)]
*  The polls close and in states like Florida where they dump in all the early vote data in the vote by mail results right away [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=869.0400000000001s)]
*  And they see those numbers and they'll know whether they correctly calculated [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=875.6800000000001s)]
*  Support scores and turnout composition so people like us [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=879.36s)]
*  I think you can if you want to read it to look for something positive go for it if you want to read it look for [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=882.36s)]
*  For doom that's your choice, but it's really sort of a black box [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=886.32s)]
*  Or if you want to just reach out to everyone you know [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=890.3199999999999s)]
*  And everywhere you can post about why Trump and JD Vance would be horrible for women and issues that women care about [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=894.7199999999999s)]
*  You can do that, too. I mean that's that is another option other than pouring [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=902.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm just gonna say that for all the things we talked about today [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=907.16s)]
*  You know we're so close as I mentioned Trump did talk about protecting women against their will while wearing an orange vest [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=909.8399999999999s)]
*  Why was he wearing an orange vest and because he had just climbed out of a garbage truck obviously [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=915.86s)]
*  Why was he in a garbage truck? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=920.42s)]
*  Because a comedian at his Madison Square Garden rally called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=922.38s)]
*  Which led to days of bad headlines which led to Joe Biden saying something? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=927.34s)]
*  Unintelligible on zoom that sounded like he might be calling Trump supporters garbage [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=931.98s)]
*  Which has led the Trump campaign to engage in two of their favorite pastimes playing victim and running against Joe Biden [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=935.7s)]
*  It was a theme Trump hit again on Thursday and an event in of all places Albuquerque, New Mexico [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=943.18s)]
*  Here he is driving that message and talking about why he made a stop in Albuquerque [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=950.5s)]
*  New Mexico look I don't make me waste a whole damn half a day here, okay look I [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=956.02s)]
*  Came here. You know we could be nice to each other or we can talk turkey. Let's talk turkey, okay? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=962.2199999999999s)]
*  first of all [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=968.38s)]
*  Hispanics love Trump [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=970.2199999999999s)]
*  So I'm here for one simple reason I like you very much, and it's good for my [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=973.02s)]
*  credentials with the Hispanic or Latino community [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=979.02s)]
*  days ago Joe Biden called our [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=983.0999999999999s)]
*  supporters [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=986.26s)]
*  Garbage your garbage to wear garbage. I remember the word deplorable. Do you remember the word? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=987.8199999999999s)]
*  How did that work out Hillary not too good? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=993.74s)]
*  But they mean it even though without question my supporters are of far higher quality [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=997.14s)]
*  And I think much smarter than crooked Joe or lion come I mean [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1002.66s)]
*  What do you think it was Halloween costume? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1008.02s)]
*  I'm glad my son didn't see it I [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1010.58s)]
*  Know I purposely didn't show Charlie the pictures of Trump in the garbage truck because I thought that it might make them like Trump more [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1014.5s)]
*  It's I mean Hallie [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1020.9s)]
*  And I was showing it to her on my phone while we were sitting on the couch and Jack ran over to see like [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1022.26s)]
*  What are you guys looking at? I was like nothing nothing [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1027.06s)]
*  Anyone driving a garbage truck is automatically his hero and so I we were like you cannot see that so if [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1030.1399999999999s)]
*  Three or three and four year olds could vote this would be a masterstroke, but alas they cannot I [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1035.62s)]
*  am confused as to why they want to continue to keep the [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1041.6599999999999s)]
*  Puerto Rico garbage story in the headlines now for the fifth day [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1048.14s)]
*  Yeah, I know they think that they've got their deplorable moment even though [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1053.8200000000002s)]
*  It's Joe Biden sort of stumbling over his words on a zoom, and he's not the fucking candidate [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1058.5800000000002s)]
*  Like I'm sure like I get it right wing media is just running wild with this part of the reason [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1065.8200000000002s)]
*  I think they're running wild with it is because [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1072.1200000000001s)]
*  They all know how bad and damaging the Madison Square Garden rally was even like Megan Kelly was [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1074.12s)]
*  Complaining about it on her show saying that the Trump campaign was stupid for you know [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1080.0s)]
*  It was like too brode up to have all this comedians there and making terrible jokes [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1083.56s)]
*  and so I think they finally see this as an opportunity to [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1088.04s)]
*  Turn the page to borrow a phrase on all that, but I don't know if it really does that [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1091.84s)]
*  I think I'm sure that there's like Trump supporters who are like don't call us garbage [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1096.4799999999998s)]
*  But I don't think anyone's like oh Joe Biden mumbled on a zoom and so [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1100.12s)]
*  Meanwhile that must that must mean that Kamala Harris thinks that too [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1106.1s)]
*  Okay, all right a couple things here first. There is no evidence whatsoever [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1110.3999999999999s)]
*  That Hillary Clinton's deplorable comment mattered at all right? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1115.6799999999998s)]
*  Oh, well that's a good place to start yes, because that is that that is the it has become a [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1119.08s)]
*  Fact in the minds of Republicans and the media that that was the moment when the election fell apart for not [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1125.5400000000002s)]
*  I don't know Jim Comey's ill-timed letter to Congress that led the press to lose their fucking mind 13 days before the election [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1131.26s)]
*  Maybe that was a thing but the deport was coming not a real thing [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1137.0400000000002s)]
*  They are obviously trying you're looking when you're in a bad news like we're always looking for something to [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1140.42s)]
*  You know turn the page be a circuit breaker on what's happening [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1145.42s)]
*  Generally you want to look for something that does not include the word that is most associated with the scandal [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1148.5s)]
*  You're trying to avoid [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1153.38s)]
*  Right, so like this is the suboptimal choice and not literally wear that word [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1154.8000000000002s)]
*  Just then the drape yourself in it [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1161.24s)]
*  The place and it right wing media went nuts for it because they're for all the reasons you said I would say [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1163.6000000000001s)]
*  Traditional media the political media did exactly color itself in glory made playbook on the morning after Kamala Harris is closing argument speech [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1168.48s)]
*  I'd like [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1176.5s)]
*  17 paragraphs of insanity of we don't know what he meant, but it could matter [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1177.5200000000002s)]
*  Here's how it could matter. Here's the speckle. There's a New York Times story that was so infuriating [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1182.44s)]
*  I know we were both raging about it the other night [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1186.66s)]
*  It was such a reach to tie it to Kamala Harris who? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1188.8200000000002s)]
*  gives a speech at the same time that Joe Biden is saying this where over and over in the speech she talks about [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1192.42s)]
*  Reaching out to the other side and stuff like that and then is asked about Biden's but like well he clarified [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1198.02s)]
*  But let me just tell you I think it's a you know, like totally did the right thing here [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1202.5s)]
*  and [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1207.8200000000002s)]
*  They just and they're like, yeah, but but but Biden's gaffes are trailing Harris like they're like like personifying Biden's gaffes [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1209.04s)]
*  They're just the gaffes are just walking around behind her. What the fuck are you talking about? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1217.16s)]
*  But also any story that says something like it could spark a backlash or could well [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1221.52s)]
*  No, that's not your job to predict what voters may do [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1228.28s)]
*  Your job is to wait until they do it and then cover that [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1231.08s)]
*  And maybe they maybe if it's on a fake bullshit issue [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1234.8999999999999s)]
*  They won't do it because you did your actual fucking job and you explained what really happened as opposed to just doing preemptive [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1237.58s)]
*  Political prognostication. Okay rant over. I know and I also when it happened. I actually when the Biden thing happened [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1243.82s)]
*  I was like, you know, I rolled my eyes [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1249.86s)]
*  But I actually wasn't worried for Kamala Harris because I was like this is if anything an opportunity for her [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1251.06s)]
*  She just gave a speech where she was like, I want to reach out to the other side [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1256.74s)]
*  I want them to have a seat at the table. Donald Trump wants to put them in jail his political opponents and both and [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1260.46s)]
*  So she can now say you know what if you don't like what Joe Biden said [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1266.08s)]
*  I'm the person that you get to vote for and as I've said in this campaign [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1269.72s)]
*  I am NOT Joe Biden and you've all wanted me to separate myself from Joe Biden. Well, here I am [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1273.24s)]
*  I gave this speech and that's a different message than what some people heard from Joe Biden again [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1277.48s)]
*  We don't even know what Joe Biden really meant. I would not imagine Joe Biden would call Donald Trump's [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1282.1200000000001s)]
*  Voters and supporters garbage because that's who Joe Biden is [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1288.02s)]
*  Everything ever says right, but clearly he was just you know doing the Biden thing on zoom. So there you go [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1292.6200000000001s)]
*  I put a mega hat on he put a Trump campaign hat on a firehouse like a month ago. I know it's just come on [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1298.2800000000002s)]
*  It's stupid. It's all stupid. Let's back up for a second. Talk about Donald Trump in New Mexico [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1304.5800000000002s)]
*  You know you heard in that clip he as usual reads the stage directions [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1309.26s)]
*  I'm here to get some to boost my credentials with [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1313.72s)]
*  But what what the New Mexico thing he's not winning New Mexico, there's my prediction he's not winning New Mexico [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1321.8000000000002s)]
*  Oh now we make predictions on this podcast just you know what he's he's not winning, Massachusetts [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1327.68s)]
*  If he wins New Mexico, you say others gonna win New Mexico is really low in the list of problems we have [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1333.5600000000002s)]
*  No one's gonna remember that no one's gonna remember that well I forget right now, but yes [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1339.72s)]
*  For the pundits. Yes [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1345.54s)]
*  Yeah, so he's just head fakes show of confidence. What do you think? [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1347.74s)]
*  I think I mean he told us why he's doing it [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1351.54s)]
*  It is to build credibility with the Latino community because I'm sure that morning he woke up is like where we going guys [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1354.94s)]
*  And they're like New Mexico is like why the fuck are we going to New Mexico and they're like the build credibility with the Latino community [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1359.68s)]
*  And so he just said those words. It's it's weird. It doesn't make a ton of sense [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1364.04s)]
*  I don't know how much credibility you're building with Latino community. I [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1368.72s)]
*  The trunk of being clearly has a thesis that's somewhat to a certain extent shared by the Harris community [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1372.74s)]
*  I think is correct, which is all politics is kind of national now the value of these local stops [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1378.38s)]
*  It has gone down for a couple reasons. It's gone down because local media just matters less than did before there's less of it and [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1384.06s)]
*  when you've been to [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1390.78s)]
*  Green Bay, Wisconsin for the ninth time in the last four months like how much coverage are you getting right? [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1393.2s)]
*  Is it's not the same because of the same sort of impact you did before so he goes there more people pay attention to it [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1398.68s)]
*  and he's trying to craft a narrative that [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1403.52s)]
*  his campaigns ascendant and they're competing in these blue states that were [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1405.8799999999999s)]
*  The dead Republicans traditional Republicans can't compete in but he can because he's whatever I don't think it's a great use of time and [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1410.84s)]
*  I saw someone say that if he oh, this was former a Demarca [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1417.32s)]
*  Rubio said if you lose Pennsylvania by a thousand votes, he's really gonna regret not going to Pennsylvania in the final weekend [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1421.74s)]
*  so yeah, I just mark Caputo just had a story about this and the bulwark and [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1426.64s)]
*  he sort of asked around the Trump campaign and [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1432.04s)]
*  Someone said to him where the Trump campaign we're gonna go where the fuck we want to go and too bad if you don't get it [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1435.96s)]
*  And then I guess a couple other sources said to him just like this is Trump he wants to project confidence [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1444.68s)]
*  He thinks that he can win some of these states. It's just in his head in his gut [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1449.86s)]
*  he thinks he can and I think this is also like a they're trying to [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1454.22s)]
*  Show confidence so that if he loses he can say well, I couldn't I was in New Mexico in Virginia [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1459.74s)]
*  I thought I could win those like this is it's impossible. They cheated. That's the only way they can win is if they cheat [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1465.6799999999998s)]
*  It's just it's helping his um, he's stopped the steel narrative if if he ends up losing so [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1469.6599999999999s)]
*  Alright speaking of the Trump campaign supreme confidence [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1475.22s)]
*  Trump transition co-chair Howard Lutnick the billionaire CEO of an investment bank is [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1478.6799999999998s)]
*  He's suddenly he's out and about previewing Trump's policy agenda for the second term feeling confident [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1484.48s)]
*  You guys all heard tape of him on the Wednesday pod [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1490.84s)]
*  scream asking Elon Musk at the [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1494.6399999999999s)]
*  Madison Square Garden rally how much funding they could cut from federal agencies [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1497.1599999999999s)]
*  The answer was apparently two trillion dollars a sum that would almost certainly [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1501.4399999999998s)]
*  Decimate people's health and retirement benefits in this country [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1505.48s)]
*  On Wednesday night Lutnick did a CNN sit-down with Caitlin Collins [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1508.8s)]
*  She asked him several direct questions about Trump and RFK juniors claim that RFK will be [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1513.2s)]
*  basically in charge of public health in some capacity in a Trump administration and [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1519.32s)]
*  Here's how it went. So I spent [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1525.9199999999998s)]
*  Two and a half hours this week with Bobby Kennedy, Jr [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1528.84s)]
*  And what he explained was when he was born we had three vaccines and [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1532.36s)]
*  Autism was one in ten thousand now a baby's born with 76 vaccines [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1537.1799999999998s)]
*  Okay, junior is a vaccine skeptic. He pushes lies about vaccines and I don't even think if [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1541.5s)]
*  Pushing lies. Why you said you said I'm not a scientist and you aren't so he just [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1547.82s)]
*  Pushes lies he says if you give me the data [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1553.9399999999998s)]
*  All I want is the data and I'll take on the data and show that it's not safe [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1556.82s)]
*  And then if you pull the product liability the companies will yank these vaccines right off off of the market [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1561.62s)]
*  All right. So there you go [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1568.22s)]
*  Vote Donald Trump if you want your kids not to be vaccinated anymore [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1570.6399999999999s)]
*  because because if he wins RFK jr is gonna get to be in charge of public health and [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1577.72s)]
*  Howard Lutnick says that our RFK jr wants to get get the vaccines yanked from the market [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1585.16s)]
*  smallpox in every pot I [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1593.6000000000001s)]
*  mean [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1595.68s)]
*  First of all, why should people care what this guy Lutnick? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1596.88s)]
*  thinks he's the chair of Trump's transition and so [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1600.92s)]
*  For weeks now if not months, there's been a group of people in an office somewhere in New York [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1604.48s)]
*  I think is where Trump says that is [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1608.9s)]
*  Plotting Trump's administration now primarily they're taking project 2025 and just sort of scratching though [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1611.74s)]
*  They're just doing a rewriting Trump over it [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1616.26s)]
*  but what they're really doing is they're putting together lists of people who are going to staff the Trump government and [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1618.66s)]
*  This is not just the Secretary of State Secretary of Defense the cabinet members [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1625.5s)]
*  We know it's the undersecretaries the administrators the people that we pay no attention to but have tremendous power over things like [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1628.44s)]
*  Vaccine policy prescription drug approvals all of these things [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1636.1399999999999s)]
*  and so if the person [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1639.8999999999999s)]
*  Who is in charge of putting this whole operation together who is signing off on these lists of possible names? [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1641.9399999999998s)]
*  so to go to Trump is someone with the [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1646.54s)]
*  Not very well-informed views of Howard Lutnick that speaks the kind of administration Trump will have like this is a person with real power [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1649.3799999999999s)]
*  to shape government policy through personnel [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1654.9399999999998s)]
*  And so Caitlin also asked him like, you know [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1657.5s)]
*  Is he going to be the Health and Human Services Secretary and let Nick basically said no the back story there is [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1660.98s)]
*  The Trump campaign isn't sure that RFK jr. Could actually get confirmed by the Senate to be [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1666.64s)]
*  the Health and Human Services Secretary because [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1673.44s)]

*  He he's an anti-vax loon [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1685.02s)]
*  So they don't not sure he they could get him confirmed but Donald Trump could make him like a czar in the White House over the [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1687.52s)]
*  Overseas the public health agencies and he could still have a lot of power to again [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1694.44s)]

*  that killed [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1722.72s)]
*  83 people most of them children because he went down there and talked to a bunch of anti-vax crazies and [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1724.4s)]
*  Promoted them called them heroes. And then now is like, oh no, I had nothing to do with it [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1730.96s)]
*  Even though at the time he was like, yeah, it's probably the vaccines [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1735.08s)]
*  They're problematic and then you know vaccination rates fell dramatically in Samoa after he went and then [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1737.56s)]
*  There was a measles outbreak and a bunch of people died like this is I know there's just a lot of shit flying around [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1742.82s)]
*  Right now because it's the end of the campaign [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1747.86s)]
*  But if for nothing if for no other reason vote because RFK jr [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1749.58s)]
*  Could be in charge of vaccines and public health and could take vaccines off the market that you need to [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1755.62s)]
*  Survive I just it's wild. Yeah, it's not completely wild. I [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1763.62s)]
*  Also, I don't think it's very [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1768.9399999999998s)]
*  It's a politically wise move [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1770.8999999999999s)]
*  No, just that way just looked up, you know [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1773.98s)]
*  69% of of all adults say that it's very slash extremely important to get kids vaccinated now [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1777.6599999999999s)]
*  Unfortunately, that number has fallen since the pandemic but only among Republican voters because we also would happen there but [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1785.1799999999998s)]
*  Around 70% still saying it's a it's pretty important to get your kids vaccinated. It's a big number. It's a big number [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1792.3799999999999s)]
*  It just the the theme here of [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1798.4599999999998s)]
*  To the Madison grow garden rally the crazy things Elon Musk has said Mike Jonathan saying affordable care actually be repealed [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1802.54s)]

*  I know I know it's wild like Elon Musk out there talking about cutting two trillion dollars and and saying that yeah [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1824.62s)]
*  Trump's Trump's agenda would cause a temporary hardship on people but you know what because the economy would crash we'd crash the economy [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1832.6999999999998s)]
*  We elect us to crash the economy repeal their formal care act take vaccines off the shelf just [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1839.98s)]
*  Donald Trump and Elon Musk and RFK Judy they'll all be fine. They'll all be fine [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1847.1s)]
*  But everyone else is just gonna have to go through some temporary hardship [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1850.86s)]
*  Ah, so deep breath our final Friday pod before the election [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1854.36s)]
*  Thought it was a good time to take [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1861.7199999999998s)]
*  One last almost last whip around to the battleground states do some final thoughts on what we're seeing what we're looking for [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1864.28s)]
*  I'm ordering these [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1871.32s)]
*  In terms of what I think is most is easiest for Harris to hardest [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1873.32s)]
*  Okay, but you can tell me if you disagree. Okay [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1879.08s)]
*  I'm gonna start with Michigan. I think I think Michigan is the is the easiest of the battlegrounds for her going out there [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1883.36s)]
*  It's her best state in the polls. First of all [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1890.6s)]
*  Right now she's probably got the largest lead there of any battleground state. Of course that lead is [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1893.1999999999998s)]
*  Right right, but also Biden won Michigan by the biggest margin of any of the swing states around three points [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1901.04s)]
*  150,000 votes [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1908.4399999999998s)]
*  Of course the concerns there things will be looking for [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1910.32s)]
*  Arab-american and Muslim voters [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1915.24s)]
*  Upset with the war in Gaza [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1918.48s)]
*  Of course, there's probably about 400,000 Arab American and Muslim voters in Michigan hundred thousand people voted uncommitted [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1920.6399999999999s)]
*  In the primary so that is something to watch [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1927.6s)]
*  I'm also going to be watching [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1933.0s)]
*  Union members and just workers in general because they have been running a [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1934.92s)]
*  Trump campaign Republicans and super PACs have been running a ton of ads about [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1940.16s)]
*  electric vehicles and telling people that Kamala Harris and Alyssa Slotkin are gonna make you you know, like give up your gas-powered car and [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1944.3200000000002s)]
*  You're gonna be forced to buy an electric vehicle and China is gonna make the electric vehicles and it's gonna put [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1952.8400000000001s)]
*  autoworkers out of business and so I'm you know looking at that and then I'm looking at you know black turnout and [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1958.0400000000002s)]
*  black voter turnout [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1964.92s)]
*  You know my my gut is that her margins among black voters are the same [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1966.4s)]
*  around the same as Biden [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1973.4s)]
*  But turnout is the one that I I wonder about you know, whether whether black turnout will be the same [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1975.64s)]
*  There was a report from Detroit today that they are on pace in that city to already break turnout records from 2020 [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1980.5200000000002s)]
*  Which would be great a great sign obviously [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1988.68s)]
*  A lot of black voters in Detroit. So anyway, those are my thoughts on Michigan. What do you think? Yeah, it's sort of a lot of the same things [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1991.28s)]
*  the [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=1999.84s)]
*  You know, how does Kamala Harris do in those parts in and around Dearborn right where there's a large American population? [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2001.16s)]
*  Does she dramatically underperform Biden's numbers there does overall turnout go down because people don't vote [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2007.76s)]
*  Do we end up with people who leave the top of the ticket blank? So I'm very curious about that [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2012.6s)]
*  And I'm really because of that and really I'm looking at third-party vote in Michigan more than anywhere else [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2017.64s)]
*  Rfk jr. Still on the ballot in Michigan [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2022.68s)]
*  Yeah, and Jill signed RFK jr. Was getting three and a half percent in a poll. I saw the other day in Michigan [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2026.0s)]
*  Where is that vote coming from? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2032.0s)]
*  The way the way the poll is written seemed it was possible that that was helping Kamala Harris a little bit [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2033.72s)]
*  But so that is the place where you have perhaps the largest group of people who voted for Biden [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2037.68s)]
*  Who may be looking for somewhere else to go [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2044.24s)]
*  That is not Trump and so that cut that's a net loss of one for Harris [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2047.1999999999998s)]
*  And can she make up for that because you know for people who listen to the Sunday pod [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2051.72s)]
*  I talked to Ron Brownstein about demographic changes and the place where there's been the most demographic change where the share of the [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2055.96s)]
*  electorate that is [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2061.92s)]
*  White non college educated has gone down the most is in Michigan. And so can she replace that with new? [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2063.44s)]
*  Suburban voters and higher turnout a month in in Detroit [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2069.52s)]
*  Yeah, and then the counties around Detroit for those suburban voters like Oakland County [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2073.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, those are the counties where she needs she really needs to run up the score and could possibly do better than Biden [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2078.3199999999997s)]
*  All right. What do you think about Pennsylvania? [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2085.56s)]
*  That's my next one. Is that your next one? I [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2087.7999999999997s)]
*  Would you go Wisconsin over for Pennsylvania? I [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2090.68s)]
*  Would probably just go for most of this election. I felt better about Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and actually that's almost like both of the campaigns felt [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2094.64s)]
*  I think that shifted in recent days here. It's really basically just come down to the fact that [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2101.8s)]
*  Pennsylvania is just more suburban and more diverse and even though that math is not the same for us potentially as it was in previous elections [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2107.6000000000004s)]
*  It's Wisconsin just an incredibly white state and it's very very rural so that as I would probably they're close [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2114.5200000000004s)]
*  But I probably say Pennsylvania is her next best. It's the one by one by about a point and a half about 80,000 votes [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2121.28s)]
*  I believe [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2126.2400000000002s)]
*  Here it's once again turn out in the collar counties around Philly and then the suburbs of Allegheny County and then can she [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2127.4s)]
*  Do well in some of you know in across Pennsylvania? [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2134.88s)]
*  There are lots of mid-sized cities cities like Lancaster and Scranton. Can she do well in those cities and actually outperform? [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2138.08s)]
*  Biden in those cities which could make up for some bleed she might have either [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2144.7200000000003s)]
*  With black voters if you are not correct about that, and I hope you are correct [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2149.04s)]
*  Or if she's under performs Biden with rural white voters [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2153.24s)]
*  So sort of suburban the suburb the suburban areas around the big cities and then the small mid-sized cities have become places where Democrats [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2158.04s)]
*  Have gotten a lot of vote from recently. You got a bunch of those in Pennsylvania [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2164.54s)]
*  I think the the bull case for some of these a lot of these blue wall states is in these rural [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2167.52s)]
*  Counties and small towns and small cities where Trump tends to do well, especially in the rural's [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2174.54s)]
*  He's he wins with like crushing margins, but he doesn't have a lot more vote to squeeze out [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2178.96s)]
*  From the rural areas from some of the ex-urban areas [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2186.56s)]
*  He does that the places outside the suburbs that are growing right so like you could see if the ex-urbs [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2189.24s)]
*  Shifted to the right and Trump got more vote out of there [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2194.12s)]
*  It could start canceling out some of her gains in the suburbs [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2196.68s)]
*  But I think population wise like there's a lot there the part these the southeastern part of Pennsylvania those suburbs [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2198.96s)]
*  South of Philly like that has grown a bunch [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2206.2s)]
*  So there's like an opportunity for her to to have bigger margins than Biden and just get more vote out of there and that [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2208.7999999999997s)]
*  That and and same thing with Allegheny County around Pittsburgh. So that but like you said that that cancels out hopefully [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2214.68s)]
*  Either his strength in the ex-urbs or some combo of that plus, you know black and Latino voters [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2221.96s)]
*  inching towards Trump and then obviously [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2228.2799999999997s)]
*  Obviously the Puerto Rican voters in Philly and Allentown obviously be very something will be very interested in [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2230.2799999999997s)]
*  Wisconsin can Ben Wickler save America again [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2235.6000000000004s)]
*  No pressure bed, I know it's a it's like dem what you just said, which is like demographic wise of the Blue Wall states [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2240.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm most nervous about Wisconsin, but organization wise and turnout wise [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2247.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I feel best about Wisconsin [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2252.6800000000003s)]
*  Yes [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2255.0s)]
*  because of the organization that Ben and the entire Wisconsin Democratic Party and all the organizers and volunteers who have worked tirelessly in Wisconsin since [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2255.2400000000002s)]
*  2016 have put together [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2264.6s)]
*  the [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2266.16s)]
*  So obviously you will want to know what happened what goes on in Milwaukee in terms of turnout and support levels for [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2267.08s)]
*  Harris the other thing is Dane County where Madison is has grown a ton in the last four years [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2273.04s)]
*  Some of that is people moving from other parts of the state in today [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2277.9199999999996s)]
*  But it's also a lot of people who post-pandemic moved halt moved to other parts of the country [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2280.64s)]
*  And so you have some in migration of more [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2285.08s)]
*  College-educated suburban voters in Dane County and can that population growth offset further losses in rural areas? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2288.22s)]
*  Because you know Biden and Democrats they get it's getting to be like a sod margins in Dane County now [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2295.14s)]
*  And the turnout in Dane County is off the charts. I mean, there's like a few counties [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2304.42s)]
*  In swing states that have as high turnout with as good margins for Democrats than Dane County [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2310.58s)]
*  I mean we went canvassing in Dane County and that was I would say not exactly hard work [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2315.98s)]
*  It was like we know we've already voted. We know when we're gonna vote. We all we have [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2320.6200000000003s)]
*  17 we have signs for Kamala Harris Tammy Baldwin and like nine ballot initiatives in our front yard [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2324.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's political utopia. But again, you know Biden went up by 20,000 votes [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2330.5s)]
*  And so the margin in Wisconsin just for you know voters who? [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2337.02s)]
*  Trump getting if Trump gets more votes or if Trump, you know, if Biden voters go back to Trump or whatever [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2341.5s)]
*  It's it's just a smaller margin than it is in Michigan and Pennsylvania. So I 21,000 21,000 votes [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2346.46s)]
*  Yeah, that is why it's you know, it's it's worrisome [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2351.7799999999997s)]
*  The suburbs in Wisconsin the suburbs outside of Milwaukee have not moved as aggressively Democratic as they have in Pennsylvania and Michigan and other part [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2355.3399999999997s)]
*  In other battleground states. I'm gonna be curious to see if you see growth there [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2362.62s)]
*  There were 76,000 Haley voters in the Republican primary in Wisconsin [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2366.64s)]
*  Can she get 10 15 20,000 of those votes that could really help? Yeah for sure [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2371.06s)]
*  Nevada you [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2376.78s)]
*  Mentioned earlier that John Ralston's [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2378.86s)]
*  His his blog about that. He updates with the numbers from Nevada every night. It's not exactly been great [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2381.38s)]
*  but [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2389.1800000000003s)]
*  There's a possibility. What's the bar? [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2391.1s)]
*  but [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2394.7000000000003s)]
*  One thing we've talked about is that voting behavior has just changed and [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2396.46s)]
*  So Republicans are voting earlier now and it's sort of hard to tell [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2401.66s)]
*  What's happening there, but I don't know. What do you want to say about Nevada? [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2407.2200000000003s)]
*  I think Nevada is the test case about whether Trump is making real gains with working-class Latino voters [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2409.62s)]
*  I think they are disparate compared to all the other states. We're talking about [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2416.46s)]
*  disproportionately [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2420.62s)]
*  Located in Nevada and if he is we will see that there it's interesting you I assume you have Nevada in this place in the order [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2421.82s)]
*  Because it was the largest margin of the remaining states and in fact the second largest margin in 2020 [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2429.0600000000004s)]
*  Is that why yes, but graphically the hardest I think I think it's demographically one of the hardest [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2434.3s)]
*  I do think the turnout the organization the Democrats have the other turnout machine there is still pretty strong [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2440.6600000000003s)]
*  You know is built by Harry Reid when when he was alive and he was Democratic leader and it's quite effective and [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2447.8599999999997s)]
*  I just noted I just looked at it before we started recording looked at Ralston's blog the reason that Ralston and Nevada are like [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2455.02s)]
*  the exception to [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2462.3999999999996s)]
*  reading the tea leaves on the early vote is that now everyone in Nevada gets mailed a ballot and [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2463.8999999999996s)]
*  A lot of people in Nevada most people vote before election day [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2470.74s)]
*  So if you have an early vote, that's like, you know [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2476.04s)]
*  6570 percent of registered voters or 65 70 percent of the final vote you can make some assumptions on that, right? [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2479.56s)]
*  Yeah, not you can't predict who's gonna win [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2486.44s)]
*  but you can make some assumptions the challenge is as they have they have automatic voter registration in Nevada as well and [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2488.6s)]
*  when they automatically [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2495.2400000000002s)]
*  Register you if you don't pick a party you're automatically registered just as with no party [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2497.16s)]
*  and so you're seeing the share of [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2502.56s)]
*  No party voters like much higher than it's been in the past and we don't know if those votes from the early vote [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2505.48s)]
*  we don't know if those votes are for Kamala Harris or for Donald Trump and so Republicans have [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2512.2s)]
*  Quite a lead in ballots right now over Democrats in Nevada [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2517.72s)]
*  thanks largely to the rural counties in Nevada and [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2521.32s)]
*  Clark County, which is where Vegas is is sort of underperforming its registration [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2525.04s)]
*  So the percentage of the vote from Clark is just lower than it has been in the past and the rules are like just [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2529.6s)]
*  blowing the doors off the place and so [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2535.56s)]
*  If if it stays that way then it's gonna be really hard for her to win [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2538.56s)]
*  But the idea is that maybe all these voters in Clark County who voted last time who just haven't voted yet [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2542.48s)]
*  Are gonna either show up in the next couple days or show up on election day and if they still live there, right? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2548.96s)]
*  That's one of the hardest parts about Clark County in particular is there's just it's very transient [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2553.84s)]
*  People who move in every cycle people you ever as I have done a couple times canvassed in Las Vegas [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2557.98s)]
*  The addresses are different. It's like it's like [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2562.7s)]
*  We're about to find out yes [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2566.06s)]
*  Would say I should have it was a rewarding sign in my should have in my 2016 life if I had paid more attention to [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2569.42s)]
*  The to the door knocks when I was in Vegas [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2574.78s)]
*  But so it is all hard to tell but normally Democrats go in with a big advantage and then Republicans have to win a [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2576.42s)]
*  Shockingly high percentage of the election day vote and they have failed to do that in most elections of consequence over the last decade or so [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2582.34s)]
*  Now that firewall will not exist [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2589.9s)]
*  Of any kind so the opposite. It's a Republican firewall now that may even out by the time is all done [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2592.54s)]
*  But we did we would have the we'd bank all these votes and we were not banking. We're not making a lead here [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2597.7400000000002s)]
*  But so everyone knows Nevada plays a role in very few paths to 270 for Kamala Harris [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2603.6600000000003s)]
*  Just because it only has six electoral votes there are some [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2610.2599999999998s)]
*  If you I forget which blue wall state if you lose and then you lose, Pennsylvania you can replace it with [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2613.8999999999996s)]
*  There or Arizona or Arizona, Nevada [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2620.66s)]
*  Well, if you lose, Pennsylvania you you can win North Carolina or Georgia and Nevada and get to do get to over 270, right? [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2623.46s)]
*  Okay, so there's a couple paths it shows up in I have Georgia next [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2631.3399999999997s)]
*  Would you have Arizona, North Carolina before it? [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2637.14s)]
*  No, I would probably I think you could flip a coin for Arizona Georgia here [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2639.7s)]
*  It really depends on I kind of I kind of do too. It kind of depends on what [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2643.7s)]
*  Narrative you want to buy right if you if you are correct that the polls are [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2648.2999999999997s)]
*  The if you're correct that Kamala Harris is going to get to basically Biden level margins with black voters [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2655.3799999999997s)]
*  Then Georgia should be next in line because it is it's a huge [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2661.4199999999996s)]
*  Black voting population has obviously turned out in 2020 and 2022 to elect [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2666.98s)]
*  Joe Biden Raphael Warnock twice John Ossoff almost elect Stacey Abrams twice [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2672.66s)]
*  You then Georgia would be the one also [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2678.94s)]
*  Hugh, you know very large suburbs lots of college-educated voters [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2683.1s)]
*  They could that is a formula for Democrat success. The reason Harris not pulling as well there is because in the polling [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2686.2999999999997s)]
*  She's not doing as well with black voters if that if that were to level set it's back to where it was then it's a [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2691.1s)]
*  Then it's a true toss-up state with maybe a Harris advantage [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2697.06s)]
*  Well, and and the concern I have there is the concern with black vote everywhere [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2699.94s)]
*  Which is just if if she keeps the margins [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2704.18s)]
*  But one of the reasons she's not doing well in the polls is that some black voters are just end up deciding not to vote and [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2706.7799999999997s)]
*  Turnout goes down then that that is could be a reason she loses it as well [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2713.42s)]
*  Yeah, I also think that Georgia is a state is like we've you know in the Trump era a lot of the polls [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2716.9s)]
*  We get to Election Day and it's like, oh, they've understated Trump support [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2722.82s)]
*  Georgia is not that case. In fact, sometimes I think a couple times in Georgia Georgia the polls in Georgia have like [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2727.2200000000003s)]
*  underestimated Democrat support Democratic support and Biden support [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2733.7000000000003s)]
*  In least in 2020, so it's sort of a state. I watch it. Don't like take the polling too [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2738.1s)]
*  Take the polling too as seriously as I do some other places or at least I'm not as worried about it as in other places [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2743.7799999999997s)]
*  But you know, maybe I should be [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2749.74s)]
*  But I do think there it's all about you know, blowing it out in Atlanta and the suburbs [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2752.1s)]
*  and in some rural places in Georgia where there are a lot of black voters to [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2758.54s)]
*  See if they can if she can run up the margins there and then the college towns like Athens and yes [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2763.54s)]
*  And then you know other places other places there are small to mid-size cities with large [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2768.1s)]
*  Democratic populations like Savannah [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2772.1800000000003s)]
*  What's going on with Arizona [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2775.38s)]
*  What do you think because I I was bullish on Arizona in 2020, you know, we won [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2777.6600000000003s)]
*  It was very close, but the polls have been brutal this time around. Well, I don't think they've been brutal [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2783.7400000000002s)]
*  I mean it is they've just been so different than then they were in 2020 [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2790.42s)]
*  Yeah, but they mean in the New York Times average Trump has a two-point lead, right? [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2794.98s)]
*  Which is well within the margin of error it is it is in the polling averages [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2799.34s)]
*  Kamala Harris is worst state now the fact that her worst state is at right around two points is pretty good. Frankly, um [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2803.58s)]
*  This is another thing right are the polls under over stating Trump's Latino support or [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2810.78s)]
*  Understating Kamala Harris's right because a lot of times you're getting Kamala Harris at near [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2816.1400000000003s)]
*  The bite near the bite number but Trump is not yet at his 2020 number [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2819.98s)]
*  He's just it's just the they're both under right and what's gonna happen with that undecided voter people going to vote [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2824.46s)]
*  Or they're not gonna vote right is Trump gonna get over 40 or is he gonna be stuck around 38 where it was before? [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2829.46s)]
*  And it's just you know, just [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2834.7000000000003s)]
*  When we talk all the time about the hardest to reach voters [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2836.6200000000003s)]
*  We often we're always talking about Trump voters, but that other very hard to reach voters black and Latino voters, right? [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2839.1000000000004s)]
*  When we talk they're talking about the least politically engaged and like are we actually capturing? [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2844.5s)]
*  Who that electorate is and if the end if her numbers are like Biden's in 2020 [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2848.1800000000003s)]
*  She's got a very real shot to it. Now. It's a state that Biden won by 11,000 votes [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2853.1800000000003s)]
*  So there's not a lot of margin for error there, but it's just this is a like there's something the polling is going to get wrong [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2856.58s)]
*  It happens every cycle even in a good polling year where you know, even in 2020 [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2863.02s)]
*  There are a lot of things wrong [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2867.5s)]
*  But what a member one the narratives leading into the election was Joe Biden is crushing it with seniors seniors are gonna save America [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2868.14s)]
*  and it's because in there was like well seniors are very COVID conscience because [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2874.4s)]
*  Because of the concerns of our health we have the whole election turns out seniors voted at the exact same level they have in previous elections [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2878.14s)]
*  Fuck up in the polling right and what it missed Trump's gains with Latinos totally missed them [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2884.62s)]
*  There are gonna be some things like that this time where Trump's either gonna do better or worse with some of these groups [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2889.3399999999997s)]
*  We think he is doing well with there's gonna be another group plus speculated when he was on our podcast that it would be [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2893.74s)]
*  Republicans or Republican leading independents, but something's gonna be missed in Arizona [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2899.3799999999997s)]
*  Well, maybe the state where that is if it's a Latino vote where that will be most impactful [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2903.14s)]
*  What's odd is that in the time sienna polls of Arizona? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2908.3399999999997s)]
*  Which have maybe been the worst high-quality polls for her in Arizona. I think that's what I was [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2911.48s)]
*  Getting at with the it's been rough for her. Just cuz they're good polls. She's like down five in those [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2915.76s)]
*  It her Latino number in those polls was like 60% [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2922.52s)]
*  It was she was having a problem there with like [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2927.56s)]
*  Independence she was like losing more Biden voters from 20 20 voters [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2930.88s)]
*  Than in some other states, so I don't know something. I don't know what's going on there [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2936.36s)]
*  I mean there is a lot there is a strain of McCain Republicans or so. There is a lot [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2940.0s)]
*  This is a state that move, you know, Georgian and [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2944.12s)]
*  Arizona are the states with the most [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2947.96s)]
*  Trump Biden voters those states that move the furthest over the course of four years [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2950.84s)]
*  And so we obviously we know from focus groups [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2954.96s)]
*  We hear from Sarah long one others that we bleed some of those voters and so that that could be the challenge there [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2957.36s)]
*  finally, North Carolina [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2963.36s)]
*  The white whale we always were always so close to North Carolina [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2965.6s)]
*  Yeah, I mean this one's really hard [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2970.32s)]
*  Particularly because the the hurricane and it's really disrupted [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2972.52s)]
*  People's lives there in a way in which it's hard to focus on politics and elections [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2976.44s)]
*  Particularly if you're in the actual area where people are still trying to get their lives back the other schools open businesses open [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2979.52s)]
*  Water gas all of those things [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2985.2s)]
*  North Carolina is the hardest state in this group not just because it's the one that Biden lost but in all the demographic changes [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2987.76s)]
*  I was talking about about how the share of the of the electorate represented by white working-class voters [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2993.48s)]
*  Has gone down everywhere else. It hasn't gone down in North Carolina, North Carolina [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=2999.2400000000002s)]
*  It is and this is one of the things that I will never forget [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3002.8s)]
*  Steve Kornacki writing this in a piece that was about why Kamala Harris was doing better in North Carolina, Georgia [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3006.12s)]
*  Which didn't make it down to Sand City one one reason he postulated was there are more of the voters were under [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3011.92s)]
*  Undercounted in the polls in North Carolina than Georgia. So it's very it's possible. It's just a polling problem [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3017.2400000000002s)]
*  But we don't have to see it was a 70,000 vote [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3022.76s)]
*  Margin you're gonna need a if the polls are right about the governor's race [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3025.58s)]
*  You're gonna need an unprecedented shitload of split ticket voters for Donald Trump to win the state [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3029.5s)]
*  Like just like now we said that did happen once in 2020 in Maine by to almost a similar degree [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3034.7s)]
*  But that's that's a hard thing that you know that the math is hard there [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3041.62s)]
*  Yeah, so overall you see like why the whole thing is is close because if you don't get all three blue wall states [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3045.2999999999997s)]
*  You need Arizona you need one of Arizona, North Carolina or Georgia and two of oh [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3055.14s)]
*  I said if you get if you know if you lose one of the blue wall states if you unless that blue wall states [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3062.54s)]
*  Pennsylvania then you need to oh [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3067.02s)]
*  Yeah, you need or one in Nevada. Yeah one in Nevada. Yeah, you need you need two other states [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3069.42s)]
*  One of those two states has to be Arizona or Georgia. Yes, right and we just laid out why those are those are tricky. So [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3074.22s)]
*  that's why [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3081.42s)]
*  That's why everyone's that's why it's a toss-up right now [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3083.02s)]
*  The one last thing I'll say about this is if we had an actual accurate perception of what how close the race was in 2020 [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3085.94s)]
*  Right. We were looking at the whole thing through a funhouse mirror [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3093.18s)]
*  But if we actually had known how close it really was and we were doing this exact same exercise in 2020 [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3095.54s)]
*  We would have said the same things about Arizona and Georgia and Joe Biden won them, right? That's true [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3100.94s)]
*  Yeah, and we would and we all would have been feeling just like we are now [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3106.82s)]
*  This is actually a gift from the yeah tree that we we got like we slept better we felt better our stomachs hurt less in [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3111.5s)]
*  I don't remember that by the way. I know [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3119.42s)]
*  You you were was I was I was I fine I was you were totally fine. I was yeah [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3123.1s)]
*  We talked about some time you like I've conversations with you were like even if we had the largest pulling error in history [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3130.3s)]
*  She he still wins which was true by I [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3135.46s)]
*  Feel less nervous now, even though I feel like it's very possible that he wins [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3139.2200000000003s)]
*  I feel like it's a greater chance that he wins than I did in 2020 the polling gods [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3143.0200000000004s)]
*  Understood in 2020 that with the pandemic happening. We couldn't take it [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3146.7400000000002s)]

*  Please welcome to positive America Dan Osborne. Thanks for being here. Thanks guys. Thanks for having me [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3446.54s)]
*  Absolutely your biography is a centerpiece of your campaign with very good reason [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3451.7400000000002s)]
*  Could you just start by telling our listeners who may not have been following the Nebraska Senate race super closely who you are and why? [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3455.46s)]
*  You're running. Yeah, I suppose it would it would all start, you know, I joined the Navy right out of high school [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3460.54s)]
*  I come from a long line of Navy people my grandfather retired from the Navy my parents [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3466.3s)]
*  They both met while they were in the Navy. My uncles were all in the Navy and then my older brother [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3471.86s)]
*  He joined the Marine Corps. We don't talk to him much anymore [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3476.82s)]
*  But I did I did two Western Pacific cruises aboard the USS Constellation [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3480.3s)]
*  So I got to travel the world twice over and two Westpac's [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3484.44s)]
*  And I think I think that was a good good education for a young man coming into the world [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3488.14s)]
*  But I got out I came back to Omaha where I'm from. I started attending the University of Nebraska in Omaha [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3493.9s)]
*  I then joined the Nebraska Army National Guard to continue my service [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3499.22s)]
*  I was on I was a 19 kilo on an M1a1 Abrams tank crew during that time. I've always felt compelled to service [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3503.06s)]
*  But you know my life changed when my wife Megan had our first daughter Georgia [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3510.7s)]
*  So I stopped I stopped going to school [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3516.6800000000003s)]
*  I got another honorable discharge and I started working at Kellogg's as an industrial mechanic [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3518.92s)]
*  I needed a I needed a job something with some good benefits to you know help pay for this new family [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3523.32s)]
*  I've started and one of the first days on the job an old Polish guy by the name of Ron Jabowski came up to me [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3528.7200000000003s)]
*  He looked just like Tom sell it from magna PI [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3534.32s)]
*  He said hey kid if you join the Union yet, I said no sir. I have not and goes [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3537.0s)]
*  Well, you might want to think about doing that and I'm like, well shoot Tom [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3541.32s)]
*  Sellick's telling me to join the Union better go do that [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3543.78s)]
*  So I signed up I paid my dues. I worked hard for a lot of years just provided for my family [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3547.2200000000003s)]
*  Kellogg's was a very family-friendly oriented company [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3553.26s)]
*  WK Kellogg the founder always said his number one asset resource was his people [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3556.46s)]
*  but over the years old guys like [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3561.0600000000004s)]
*  Ron and K. Tom sell it started to retire and [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3563.38s)]
*  You know Kellogg's became more beholden to their stockholders and we started to lose on contracts [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3567.1600000000003s)]
*  So I ran for executive board in my local I got elected as vice president [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3572.14s)]
*  It was about three months later [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3576.7s)]
*  It was a complete changing of the guard and about three months later the president stepped down [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3578.18s)]
*  Because you get yelled at a lot in that role by both your members and management alike [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3582.66s)]
*  But I knew the role was important. So I assumed it I did that for about a year and then kovat hit and [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3586.74s)]
*  Kovat changed a lot of lives and it certainly has changed mine [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3593.66s)]
*  You know we were working there's four [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3598.62s)]
*  Plants under the master agreement under the umbrella of the master and [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3601.82s)]
*  As essential workers, we were all working seven days a week 12 hours a day during that year at one point in time [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3606.34s)]
*  50% of our workforce was forced quarantine and or sick [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3612.34s)]
*  But we kept all four of those plants running at a hundred percent capacity and they made record profits [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3615.7400000000002s)]
*  They went from 19 billion to 21 billion dollars [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3620.7000000000003s)]
*  The CEO gave himself a two million dollar raise the board enriched themselves the stockholders enriched themselves [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3623.42s)]
*  And then our contract expired. I figured it'd be a no-brainer [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3630.1s)]
*  We'd get a little sliver of the pie [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3634.22s)]
*  But instead they sat across a negotiating table from us and they said we're gonna we're going after your health insurance [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3635.9399999999996s)]
*  We're going after your cost of living wage adjustment our only form of wage increases [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3641.8999999999996s)]
*  And then we're gonna implement a two-tier wage system permanent style with no path for a lower tier employee to go to the upper tier [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3646.3799999999997s)]
*  So for me as president, that was my old crap moment. There hadn't been a strike in Nebraska since [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3653.2999999999997s)]
*  1972 [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3658.14s)]
*  So I had to figure out what that all meant and trying to drum up all the support and learn as much as I could [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3659.42s)]
*  So when October 5th midnight rolled around we couldn't come to an agreement still my belief today Kellogg's had no intention on coming to an agreement [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3665.02s)]
*  So we shut down [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3672.1s)]
*  Four plants and we walked off the job to preserve our wages and benefits [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3673.5s)]
*  Certainly one of the hardest things I've ever had to do take [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3677.3399999999997s)]
*  500 of my friends and their family out into the great unknown not knowing if we're gonna have a job at the end of it [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3680.18s)]
*  But we all felt we were on the right side of history and I knew out on the picket line [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3685.58s)]
*  Democrats are gonna come out support. That's traditionally what they do [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3690.7799999999997s)]
*  But I didn't I don't I didn't really see my world that way [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3694.94s)]
*  I didn't see black white or women or men or Republican or Democrat [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3697.68s)]
*  I just saw people that wanted to go to work for a fair wage and some decent benefits in the time [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3702.06s)]
*  But they trade in service to the company. So I set out to make it a nonpartisan issue. I was able to [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3707.1s)]
*  Get Republican Congressman Don Bacon out to a picket line and shake hands with the members in favor of what we were trying to do [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3712.9s)]
*  I was then able to get [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3721.1s)]
*  Republican governor now US Senator from Nebraska Pete Ricketts to [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3724.06s)]
*  Draft a letter to the CEO Steve KLA and imploring him to get our people back to work [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3729.18s)]
*  Just a couple of things I did to make this a you know, a nonpartisan issue and more more just a workers issue [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3734.58s)]
*  But we settled on a strike just before Christmas and [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3741.02s)]
*  After 77 days and I remember walking in my plant just feeling a huge sense of pride we salvaged [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3746.4199999999996s)]
*  1,500 good-paying jobs around the country and that's why I'm doing this today. I haven't always been a political person [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3753.14s)]
*  But you know, I see the corporate agenda that our elected officials have [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3759.8199999999997s)]
*  My opponent certainly no different [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3764.9399999999996s)]
*  Robin Williams the late comedian said it best that he said politicians should be wearing NASCAR jackets [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3766.82s)]
*  The patches of their sponsors so we know how they're gonna vote. That is so true [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3772.02s)]
*  And my opponent certainly has a lot of patches on her jacket [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3776.5s)]
*  I've had 180 publicly advertised events and I talk about her the patches on her jacket quite a bit [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3779.94s)]
*  Talk to me a little bit about the decision to run as an independent as opposed to a Democrat or Republicans obviously easier [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3786.7400000000002s)]
*  Maybe not easier to be a Democrat in Nebraska, but just to have access to the party machinery and all of that [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3791.5s)]
*  But you may you you picked a hard path here. Tell me about why [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3796.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, well, I've been a registered independent from the time I could vote [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3800.2200000000003s)]
*  Simply because I've never I've never [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3804.5s)]
*  Really been behind that whole two-party system [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3807.7400000000002s)]
*  I've never understood why I have to have a hard set of beliefs on either that side or that side [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3811.2200000000003s)]
*  I've always [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3817.38s)]
*  Find myself more of a moderate doubt doubt working down the middle when it comes to issues and ideas and things like that [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3819.58s)]
*  But we certainly see [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3825.94s)]
*  You know this 118th Congress is arguably one of the most inefficient [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3828.74s)]
*  And working together and getting stuff done. You know, we're the farm bill is very important here in Nebraska [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3833.5s)]
*  And we've seen that come and gone. We're working on an extension from [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3838.7799999999997s)]
*  2018 so our farmers and ranchers are falling behind [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3843.14s)]
*  Inflation right now because of that [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3847.54s)]
*  There's certainly a lot of things we need to be doing better for for our people [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3849.62s)]
*  But that's that's the way I think [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3853.38s)]
*  You know the framers of the Constitution intended this to be right government by and for the people right now [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3856.02s)]
*  I feel like it's just a government for the the uber wealthy and corporations [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3861.98s)]
*  How think how let's let's say you win. How does that work when you get there? [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3866.8199999999997s)]
*  Are you gonna just simply caucus with neither party? [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3871.1s)]
*  Are you gonna make decisions based on issues if you thought if you thought that far ahead? Yeah, of course [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3873.46s)]
*  Because I'm gonna win [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3879.62s)]
*  That's good. That's that's that's the attitude we like [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3881.78s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if I like winning better or if I hate losing worse. So either way either way [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3884.1s)]
*  but you know, it's a I [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3890.58s)]
*  Think this system needs to be challenged [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3893.9s)]
*  Because I don't feel like it works for me and me and my family [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3896.98s)]
*  George Norris was the last independent senator from Nebraska. He helped [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3900.8199999999997s)]
*  Create the nonpartisan unicameral that we enjoy today. He didn't caucus with anybody his last term [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3906.66s)]
*  So there is some precedence there. Yeah, I think I think it's gonna be issue-based and that there's you know, people say [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3911.5s)]
*  Oh, well, you won't get committee assignments Senate rules. They have to be on at least two committees [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3918.1s)]
*  I'm pretty good at forming alliances and making friends. There's a chance. There's a real chance [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3922.7799999999997s)]
*  I could be the 51st swing vote in the US Senate [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3927.06s)]
*  So that people are gonna be knocking on my door, right and you use that for Nebraska [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3929.2999999999997s)]
*  I assume that's a little bit of leverage there. I guess [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3933.22s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, absolutely. That's how I can deliver for Nebraska if that scenario occurs [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3936.02s)]
*  What was some of your top priorities be when you I won't say if you end when you win? Yeah [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3941.22s)]
*  You know, I'll just start with what's important, you know in the [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3947.18s)]
*  180 town halls that I hear from Nebraskans. It's the economy and inflation [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3951.5s)]
*  Trying to get a hold of that and and just you know making it so people's paychecks go goes further [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3957.58s)]
*  You know, I hear things like and I read things like, you know [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3963.66s)]
*  My daughter's generation is gonna be one of the first generations of kids collectively that don't do better than their parents [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3967.38s)]
*  That should scare people [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3974.94s)]
*  It definitely certainly does me so we got to do better [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3977.14s)]
*  To turn that around and flip that script [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3980.46s)]
*  We all want our kids to do better and we all want to protect the environment [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3983.18s)]
*  So they have a planet to work and planet to live on right so extremely important issues [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3987.1s)]
*  but the economy inflation number two is a [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3993.5s)]
*  border security and [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3996.9s)]
*  Slash immigration you might be wondering why a landlocked state in the middle of the country like Nebraska. It would be important to people [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=3999.7799999999997s)]
*  so, you know, this is a huge beef state the industry and [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4007.14s)]
*  farming and ranching certainly and [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4011.82s)]
*  You know meatpackers [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4015.1800000000003s)]
*  employ a lot of people so [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4017.42s)]
*  They're concerned about it and but I don't think [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4020.5s)]
*  Senator Fisher she's had 12 years to do something on the border and I do believe if we you know [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4023.86s)]
*  If we don't have a border, we don't have a country. We have to secure our ports of entries [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4028.26s)]
*  Not just our southern border, but everywhere and we need we need more people to do that and we and [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4033.3s)]
*  You know because it's it's it's human trafficking it's sex trafficking it's drugs it's everything that we need to do better at [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4039.66s)]
*  Lessening the flow of all that so we need a comprehensive border package [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4050.02s)]
*  That includes drones and and then but on the flip side of that, you know, there's a there's a ten-year backlog of [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4055.9s)]
*  People waiting to get in front of a judge to the for asylum seekers. Well, there's a problem right there [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4063.1s)]
*  we need we need to address that but I was watching a debate between Ronald Reagan and George HW Bush that came over my [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4069.78s)]
*  fee the other day randomly and [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4076.82s)]
*  So I gotta stop and watch this [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4079.54s)]
*  They were talking about the border and they were talking about immigration the exact same way [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4081.82s)]
*  We were talking about it today and that was in 1980. So I [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4086.7s)]
*  Asked myself why you know, why isn't anybody doing? [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4090.98s)]
*  The meatpackers the people who benefit from [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4095.7799999999997s)]
*  Exploiting labor paying them next to nothing and they can continue to enrich themselves [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4099.98s)]
*  And those are the folks that are can afford to buy [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4103.54s)]
*  Patches on a senator's NASCAR jacket. So it comes full circle people are seeing I mean, this is a [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4106.42s)]
*  This is a very close race [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4113.66s)]
*  That's caught a lot of people by surprise [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4115.54s)]
*  We spent much of this cycle talking about the competitive Senate races being in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4117.26s)]
*  Except all the ones that people are and then all of a sudden out of nowhere comes Dan Osborne in Nebraska [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4122.3s)]
*  New York's New York Times poll has this race incredibly close. What is going on in the ground there? [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4126.900000000001s)]
*  What are you hearing from voters? It helps explain why this very [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4132.18s)]
*  Republican state is open to [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4135.62s)]
*  Replacing their Republican Center who was just elected not so long ago [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4138.54s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's because [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4143.1s)]
*  There's they're starting to to see you know when people hurt they pay a little bit more attention, you know [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4145.9400000000005s)]
*  I I liked I like the phrase it doesn't matter if you care about politics politics are gonna care about you and [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4151.54s)]
*  I think people are starting to understand that fact a little bit more [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4158.3s)]
*  Like I said when you're when your dollar doesn't goes near as far it won that long ago [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4162.78s)]
*  $250 filled up my grocery cart for a family of five now barely skims the bottom [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4167.3s)]
*  That certainly is is problematic, you know, and we see companies like Kroger [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4173.14s)]
*  You know admit to price gouging some sometimes upward of a thousand percent on items [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4178.18s)]
*  You know, we need to hold people accountable and there needs to be level playing fields for small businesses to be able to compete [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4183.620000000001s)]
*  I drive through I've driven through Nebraska four times [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4189.860000000001s)]
*  In the last year, it's pretty big landmass pretty big state [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4194.1s)]
*  But at the at the end or beginning depending on which way you're going of every single town is a dollar general [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4197.620000000001s)]
*  Every single town is a dollar general [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4202.98s)]
*  Everyone and then you see then you see boards on on windows and what used to be mom-and-pop shops because they can't compete [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4205.459999999999s)]
*  So again, it's a it's about level playing field and and people and it's about you know [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4212.58s)]
*  We've we've put in a tremendous amount of work [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4217.9s)]
*  we've gotten signatures to get on the ballot from all 93 counties here in Nebraska and [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4220.219999999999s)]
*  We have volunteers 250 volunteers all throughout the state. I have six offices open [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4225.82s)]
*  So we've put in a tremendous amount of work to make this happen [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4231.32s)]
*  But it's our message that resonates with people that if you work hard in this country your paychecks should matter plain and simple [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4235.88s)]
*  uh, you know and and [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4243.56s)]
*  I'm going to fight to do that. You know, senator fisher is just going to be a rubber stamp for whoever her party leader is [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4245.8s)]
*  That's what she's shown [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4251.8s)]
*  and then but she's she's also shown she's she votes against she wants to raise the [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4253.32s)]
*  Retirement age to 70 years old and for me as a steam fitter, that's a slap in the face [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4259.08s)]
*  I can't imagine [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4263.96s)]
*  69 years old turning pipe wrenches on a on a manlet, you know, that's that's crazy talk [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4265.48s)]
*  So we need to protect our social security benefits. That's the winning message people people [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4271.88s)]
*  We've got to take care of our retirees and and then she votes against veterans [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4276.44s)]
*  extending extending uh health care for veterans that are [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4280.82s)]
*  Victims of burn pit toxic burn pits and then dating all the way back to agent orange victims in vietnam [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4285.0s)]
*  Like who is this person? Like this is this is crazy [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4290.68s)]
*  Uh, you know and veterans are less than six percent of our population and then the burn pick victims got to be even smaller [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4294.52s)]
*  So I I don't understand how she votes the way she votes [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4300.92s)]
*  In senate race after senate race all across this country and in the presidential race abortion is a driving issue [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4305.400000000001s)]
*  What role is it playing in your race in nebraska and where are you on the issue? [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4311.320000000001s)]
*  Well, there's there's ballot initiatives. Um, so it's it's going to play a very important role. There's there's three ballot initiatives [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4315.08s)]
*  Well four I suppose two two abortion [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4321.24s)]
*  uh one [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4324.76s)]
*  Would basically codify row [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4326.4400000000005s)]
*  Standards the way we've done it for the last 50 years [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4329.24s)]
*  uh [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4332.280000000001s)]
*  the second would [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4333.4800000000005s)]
*  uh is more of a [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4335.72s)]
*  pro-life [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4337.88s)]
*  Initiative and then there's legalizing medical cannabis, which I am [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4339.32s)]
*  for [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4344.44s)]
*  Fisher is against and that's uh, you know, I don't even know what that pulls out, but i'm pretty sure that's gonna [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4345.4s)]
*  If that's your issue, you know, they're definitely gonna vote for me [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4351.96s)]
*  uh, and then and then there's family paid sick leave [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4355.48s)]
*  uh [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4358.92s)]
*  and uh [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4360.2s)]
*  She's definitely she's against that she voted against the railroaders and uh to have seven days of pto when that's all they were old [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4361.5599999999995s)]
*  Now for uh, and as somebody who's worked over 3 000 hours a year my whole life [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4368.2s)]
*  I I get the the work the need for a work-life balance, but so but going back to abortion, uh, [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4372.5199999999995s)]

*  I certainly believe uh that the federal government should stay out of our doctors offices in our bedrooms [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4398.04s)]
*  Uh, but i've i've been on record many times of saying at the federal level [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAL_01goDA&t=4405.08s)]
