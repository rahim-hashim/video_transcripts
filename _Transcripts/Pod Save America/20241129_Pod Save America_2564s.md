Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# We Answer Your Questions about Joe Rogan, Donald Trump, Kamala Harris and Future Elections
**Pod Save America:** [November 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY)
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm John Favreau. I'm John Lovett. I'm Tommy Vitor. Welcome to our annual Thanksgiving mailbag [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, it's a tradition here at Pod Save America [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=6.86s)]
*  We pulled a lot of these questions from our subscriber discord this year, which reminds me [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=10.700000000000001s)]
*  We're currently offering 25% off new annual subscriptions to Friends of the Pod [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=15.860000000000001s)]

*  Also check out this week's Pod Save the world featuring Malala. Yeah, you got Malala? Got her [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=26.72s)]
*  Ben sat down with her a couple weeks ago. She's an executive producer on a film. It's coming out about Afghanistan [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=33.16s)]
*  That's supposed to be incredibly good. She also talks about what happened when the Taliban took back Afghanistan in 2021 [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=39.12s)]
*  Including her perspective on the fall of Kabul and the women's protest movement that followed. We just cut a joke about Malala [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  Second one you've made this year you're going to in the book. Yeah, that one in and then keep going. All right [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=50.52s)]
*  Thanks to everyone who sent in questions. Let's get into it [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=56.160000000000004s)]
*  Subscriber Ian on our discord asks I'm on the left end of the spectrum [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=60.24s)]
*  But I'm a Democrat because I have long believed that this party was the best viable option to quote hitch my wagon to so to speak [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=64.12s)]
*  After this election, why is the Democratic Party still worth my time and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=70.2s)]
*  Energy yeah, anyone want to take this one first? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=75.2s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I guess if Ian moved to the UK or somewhere when there's oh hey pundit where there's a bunch of parties [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=78.2s)]
*  That that spanned the ideological spectrum. I could imagine thinking about this a little differently, but in the US we have a two-party system [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=84.28s)]
*  Better for worse. They haven't really figured out a viable path for an alternative. And so, you know in practice [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=91.72s)]
*  I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not. I think it's a good thing [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  And so, you know in practice [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=100.92s)]
*  Your choices are you know engaged in the Democratic Party and make it better or don't [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  And I choose engagement even when I feel depressed about it. There you go [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean there's there are reforms like rank-choice voting that may open the door to other parties [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=113.16s)]
*  There are local races where you can fight for a candidate of another party [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=118.44s)]
*  I think our job is to try in every election to have to [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=122.72s)]
*  Get ourselves to the best choice possible and then make the choice in front of us at the national level [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=127.72s)]
*  that's the Democratic Party and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=133.56s)]
*  Our job is to especially now in defeat to fight for a Democratic Party that can do the most good and [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=136.76s)]
*  Part of what it takes to do the most good is to win elections and we have to do both and it's hard [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=143.48000000000002s)]
*  It requires nuance [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  it requires being receptive to all kinds of people to be open to questioning your priors and to be [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=149.44s)]
*  Understanding of people you disagree with but that's that's the job we have to do now [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=158.36s)]
*  I just say like I don't think anyone should feel that they owe any political party their time and energy [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=162.32s)]
*  I do think politics is worth our time and energy because whether we like it or not [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=168.4s)]
*  Politics affects us for good or bad [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=174.32s)]
*  Time is absolutely right. Like you can you can try building a third party if you want like you're free to do that the the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=177.68s)]
*  structural incentives [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=183.88s)]
*  In in our political system away heavily against a third party succeeding very difficult, but you can try that [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=185.6s)]
*  and I think [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=192.36s)]
*  part of the work of engaging is like you can work to change the party support Democratic politicians who are closer to your views and [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=194.88s)]
*  Most importantly recognize that like political parties exist to win elections [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=204.36s)]
*  and which means that they try to reflect the views of a majority of voters and if you're frustrated that [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=208.12s)]
*  The Democratic Party isn't progressive enough. The challenge isn't about [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=215.16s)]
*  Persuading the official party so much as it's about persuading a majority of voters to move closer to where you are [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=219.32s)]
*  And I think there's I mean, it's easy because the Democratic Party is like the official [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=226.76s)]
*  That's the party. That's the establishment Democratic politicians represent it and look you can always pressure politicians and parties to to change but [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=230.64s)]
*  The problem the reason they have the position is because they think oh, this is where most people are [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=239.44s)]
*  Look the Democratic Party can't defy gravity, you know, we have to hold some space [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=243.28s)]
*  That we could be wrong and that it could evolve and I know you know this love it because he's in your media [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=247.88s)]
*  I am I and actually as long as I'm at this table. So are you two? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=253.08s)]
*  The no, I I do think also like [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=258.76s)]
*  part of the challenge we'll talk about this with with other specific issues, but part of the challenge is like [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=262.48s)]
*  Voters are not looking at a Democrat as a series of positions [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=268.0s)]
*  and actually there are ways in which I think sometimes we lose sight of the fact that a [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=273.11999999999995s)]
*  Politician sometimes has the space to push forward and be more progressive than the electorate [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=278.67999999999995s)]
*  When they have the trust of the electorate on a bunch of other issues and that really matters, right? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=284.55999999999995s)]
*  And I think right now we have we have lost that trust in a kind of broad way and it makes it very difficult is right [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=289.84s)]
*  It's why we're having a bunch of kind of ultimately like convert debates about whether it's [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=296.08s)]
*  trans issues or immigration that feel like deeply unsatisfying because I think part of it is that like there's a [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=301.12s)]
*  There's a need to kind of step back and figure out like how do we build trust with people in a broader way? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=307.28s)]
*  So that they trust us when we want to talk about difficult subjects where they may not agree right now [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=313.28s)]
*  I don't think Democrats have the space to [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=318.72s)]
*  Dance your life as it were [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=322.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I think perceptions of political parties are combination of the positions that the politicians take [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=325.04s)]
*  What they choose to talk about and importantly how they choose to talk about it [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=334.0s)]
*  Yeah, and the how there is much more nuanced and that that's what is I think getting lost in a lot of this [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=338.0s)]
*  All right subscriber Jessica on discord asks [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=345.36s)]
*  I'm trans and I'm really worried about the ability of the Democratic Party to win while keeping me in mind [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=347.76s)]
*  I would vote for them if they go quiet about trans issues [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=352.88s)]
*  But do you think that they could turn against us or just stay silent as we lose our rights? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=355.6s)]
*  If so, what can I practically do or am I shit out of luck? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=360.16s)]
*  So [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=366.08s)]
*  I'm very sorry that this person feels as though that's where we're at [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=367.04s)]
*  I think that sucks. I think it sucks that we just went through a huge loss [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=371.12s)]
*  In which we lost voters for a lot of reasons a broad swath of the electorate [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=376.72s)]
*  Different kinds of people from different walks of life and different experiences and [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=381.20000000000005s)]
*  It's been in some debates like boiled down to oh Democrats need to moderate on the trans [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=386.0s)]
*  Tran the trans issue in quotes or that trans people need to go under the bus because there was a super PAC that had an ad [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=391.92s)]
*  that used a [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=400.16s)]
*  Statement and a position that Kamala Harris took in 2020 to paint her as extreme and out of touch [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=402.40000000000003s)]
*  An issue that has basically nothing to do with what the experience of day-to-day life for a trans person in America is now a stand-in for the trans issue [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=408.32s)]
*  And so I think first of all just that is a stupid way to have this conversation [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=416.32s)]
*  That is a stupid that our Democrats gonna throw trans people under the bus. I I certainly hope not [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=421.28s)]
*  I don't believe that that will happen. It should not happen. It is both like obviously toxic [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=427.28s)]
*  Like like a terrible thing to do but also just politically stupid [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=431.28s)]
*  It's like we just like the Titanic is sinking and it's like I think we should paint it [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=434.4s)]
*  I think we should probably paint it a different color. I think that if it looked like maybe if it was like it looked like an iceberg [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=438.8s)]
*  I think that's stupid. Um, but but beyond that like I think the the truth is [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=444.71999999999997s)]
*  Sometimes especially when people want to blame identity politics for an issue [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=451.28s)]
*  They blame either activists or left Democrats who they find annoying anyway [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=455.76s)]
*  For what is actually a media creation by the right like you look at what just happened in the past week [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=461.52s)]
*  Why are we talking about trans bathrooms? It is not because Democrats [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=466.56s)]
*  Decided to have a debate about trans bathrooms because nancy may saw an opportunity to raise money by scapegoating one member of congress [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=470.4s)]
*  At the expense of trans people everywhere and their safety [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=477.84000000000003s)]
*  And we have to respond and so the question is how do you respond? You can't just ignore it because [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=481.6s)]
*  Then you look weak and also you are not standing up for people that deserve a champion you look at what aoc says and you say [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=486.8s)]
*  All right, that's a path to not only respond but also respond in a way that makes an argument that will be that will hopefully [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=493.04s)]
*  Resonate with a lot of people without being defensive and without you know, uh, uh [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=501.2s)]
*  Acting as if the way you win people back who you've lost is by capitulating like a core model [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=506.96000000000004s)]
*  Belief about tolerance and acceptance and the rights of people to live as they will so I think that is instructive about the politics [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=513.04s)]
*  I just want to like level set with what we actually have heard and seen so far [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=520.56s)]
*  Because I a big part of it as you just mentioned obviously in the Sarah McBride situation is like right wing [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=526.16s)]
*  Politicians right wing media making the thing [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=533.36s)]
*  Sometimes it's mainstream media like [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=536.88s)]
*  Realizing that covering the fight [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=539.28s)]
*  That's going on is uh can you know get more attention and then I also think that there's like [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=541.8399999999999s)]
*  There's some people who just defaulted to oh democrats want to throw trans people under the bus [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=548.16s)]
*  And I haven't seen any democrats say that or suggest that at all, right? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=552.64s)]
*  There's two things that we're basically talking about since the election one is Seth Moulton and a few others who? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=556.0s)]
*  Have raised the issue of trans people competing in certain sports at certain levels [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=561.5999999999999s)]
*  Have raised the issue of trans people competing in certain sports at certain levels and then there's the ad right which was again [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=565.52s)]
*  Government funded gender affirming surgery for immigrants who are in detention for illegally crossing the border [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=572.48s)]
*  That's the only that's the thing right and so people have either debated that ad or criticized Seth or said yeah [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=578.72s)]
*  Maybe he has a point and that's it [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=583.84s)]
*  And I have not I am not aware of any other democrat who has said we should compromise on any other [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=586.3199999999999s)]
*  Um like like gender affirming care basic rights protections [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=592.16s)]
*  Or anything like that. Maybe i'm wrong. I think there's like I think that's that's true about elected democrats [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=596.32s)]
*  I think there is like a kind of I don't know a pundit debate about had our democrats lost the mainstream on this issue [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=601.12s)]
*  There's op-eds there's debate. There's noise on social media, which obviously yeah, we get [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=607.84s)]
*  Democrats get blamed for all the time, but I think i'm sure that that is what this person is [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=612.24s)]
*  I haven't seen a policy proposal from a democrat or even a democratic pundit [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=615.36s)]
*  That's like we should ban gender affirming care [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=618.56s)]
*  We should uh, we should ban or we should ban for children or protections or rights or anything like that [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=620.8s)]
*  No, and actually I talked to liz smith about this last week on the show [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=625.5999999999999s)]
*  There's a bunch of democrats recently that actually successfully ran against republican overreach on a lot of these issues [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=628.8s)]
*  And I think you can make a compelling argument [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=635.3599999999999s)]
*  That's libertarian in a lot of ways about staying the fuck out of people's medical decisions and out of their lives and and [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=638.0s)]
*  and never [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=644.0s)]
*  Allowing for discrimination in the workplace or in housing or in anywhere else [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=645.44s)]
*  I think what people are talking what seth molten I think is trying to get at is [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=649.9200000000001s)]
*  There needs to be a more honest and open conversation about fairness in sports [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=653.84s)]
*  And the solution to that question is not going to be one size fits all [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=658.24s)]
*  It's not going to be the same policies for college kids that you have for 11 year olds [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=661.44s)]
*  And those are probably going to be sorted out in local communities [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=666.48s)]
*  And by local school districts, etc [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=670.48s)]
*  But that we should also be very clear when we're debating about this that what it would take to enforce some sort of draconian [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=673.52s)]
*  widespread ban [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=682.0600000000001s)]
*  blanket ban on transgender athletes is is what like spot genital inspections of [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=683.68s)]
*  10 year old kids is that what republicans are fighting for? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=690.0s)]
*  So like that's the kind of that's the way you make the case against some of these policy ideas [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=692.64s)]
*  well, and again like this, I think I've mentioned this on one of these pods, but um, there's a great vox piece after the [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=697.04s)]
*  election [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=703.12s)]
*  Raising the question like well biden had a policy that was like a compromise on sports [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=704.88s)]
*  And basically all these red states were trying to ban do an outright ban like tommy just mentioned on on transgender athletes competing in sports [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=710.72s)]
*  And the biden administration policy was no blanket bans are allowed prohibited. You can't do that, but individual schools can make exceptions for [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=718.16s)]
*  fairness and safety [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=727.04s)]
*  And that has to depend on a lot of that depends on the age of the person right and so like [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=729.4399999999999s)]
*  In most kids 10 or under like that wouldn't apply right because because there's not an issue [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=735.1999999999999s)]
*  Um, or certain sports wouldn't apply right because it doesn't it's it's not a safety issue there, right? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=740.24s)]
*  Or it's not even a competition issue. And so that was the biden [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=744.8s)]
*  Proposal and then then you know folks on the left got mad about it and folks on the right obviously got mad about it [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=748.54s)]
*  Because they just want bans and you know, no one talked about it [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=753.92s)]
*  They wanted the issue the republicans wanted like this does get back to like the trust issue too because it's like [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=757.4399999999999s)]
*  You know [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=764.48s)]
*  we have had [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=765.76s)]
*  trans visibility and [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=767.42s)]
*  Acceptance in some quarters for a very short period of time, right and we're in the middle of a backlash and [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=770.96s)]
*  If like if what you had were democrats out there saying [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=778.56s)]
*  Everything about my view on this issue is about making sure that [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=782.56s)]
*  trans kids [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=788.64s)]
*  Feel as though they can live as themselves and that kids who are trans can play sports when they're growing up and that trans [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=790.7199999999999s)]
*  teens can access [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=798.16s)]
*  the care that their parents and doctors approve and trans adults are treated fairly and that trans people feel safe to go to the [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=800.0s)]
*  public restrooms and like that trans people get to live full and rich lives and by the way, not just tolerated but [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=805.92s)]
*  Celebrated for the diversity they bring to our world and the good that it does and in order to get there [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=811.98s)]
*  We are willing to entertain that there are some difficult questions around competition at higher levels of compare of sports that that we should [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=819.68s)]
*  uh [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=828.48s)]
*  that we should [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=829.52s)]
*  Reasonably like sort of talk about in recognition of the fact that that is a distraction for making sure [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=830.9599999999999s)]
*  Trans people feel safe and supported and that there's growing acceptance instead of the back [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=836.48s)]
*  Backsliding that we've seen like if that was where we were at, I would say, okay great [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=841.2800000000001s)]
*  But I think that's why it's like when and I talked about this with molten like when someone like Seth molten just sort of says [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=844.88s)]
*  well, like I don't want [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=850.32s)]
*  uh a trans [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=851.76s)]
*  Uh kid running over my daughter playing sports, right? It's hostile and you're targeting a tiny subset of the population [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=853.2s)]
*  uh, and [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=860.96s)]
*  basically like kind of [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=862.32s)]
*  I don't know like making this debate something like that sort of like in response to this election, which was a [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=864.5600000000001s)]
*  brought about by so many different factors after an election in which donald trump lost the last time and gave no quarter on [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=870.6400000000001s)]
*  Fucking anything. I don't know if you talked to him about this because I haven't heard the interview yet, but um [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=876.6400000000001s)]
*  Did you see he did an interview with rolling stone where he said? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=881.2s)]
*  He's like the new york times called me up and didn't say like what happened in the election what went wrong? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=885.2s)]
*  What a democrat seems to do he's like they specifically asked me about [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=889.12s)]
*  The trans like the issue of trans rights and asked what I thought about sports [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=892.64s)]
*  Well, he's like and it became this thing [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=896.96s)]
*  He's like he's like i've you know, i've like sponsored and and voted for all this like, you know pro trans rights legislation [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=898.8s)]
*  And I still think the what he said [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=905.36s)]
*  Even though it was in response to a question was like just the fucking off worse way to say it [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=908.48s)]
*  Yeah, I mean you'll you'll hear you'll hear before this came out and what I said to him I was like he [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=912.5600000000001s)]
*  He's like we have to have the debate and I I just said like you said it in a dickish way [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=916.64s)]
*  He did and then and then he's like well now that's the problem right people are policing how we say things [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=919.6s)]
*  It's like well i'm that you're not a [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=923.2s)]
*  Undecided voter you're a member of congress people are holding you to higher standard [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=924.96s)]
*  Anyway, you can listen to the conversation [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=927.6s)]
*  But like I I I hear that and i'm just that that I think is why I think sometimes people are like wait a second [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=929.12s)]
*  We just lost the country [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=935.0400000000001s)]
*  And and we're talking about transports like that's where you went from here. It just feels like a side issue [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=937.44s)]

*  Aka he had a lot of good domestic policy [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1026.8s)]
*  But the one thing people will remember him by is his foreign policy in parentheses gaza failure [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1028.8s)]
*  Tough question. Is that from you? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1035.04s)]
*  No, that's from ben ar. Yeah [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1037.3600000000001s)]
*  Uh, I well, I mean look you guys know this I I [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1041.28s)]
*  Believe that gaza is and will continue to be a massive stain on joe biden's record [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1045.28s)]
*  um, I don't know the lbj [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1050.08s)]
*  Comparison is not totally fair here because joe biden ended the war in afghanistan [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1052.24s)]
*  Which no other president had the courage to do which was the right thing to do [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1056.8799999999999s)]
*  um unequivocally in my view, obviously it hurt him politically because of the way the withdrawal was handled, um, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1061.12s)]
*  and well, and also there's also I think a fair argument that [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1068.72s)]
*  Uh ending a 20-year war is always going to end [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1072.8s)]
*  Really ugly and messy no matter what and joe biden was just the one who? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1076.8s)]
*  Uh who did it the harder question for biden about his legacy though. It's not just gaza. It's [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1080.8799999999999s)]
*  What happens? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1086.08s)]
*  To parts of it that trump doesn't like right. So you're going to repeal the ira is he going to repeal the chips act [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1087.4399999999998s)]
*  I doubt he repeals the highway bill [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1092.24s)]
*  But we'll see [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1094.32s)]
*  Uh trump will almost certainly pull us out of the paris climate accords [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1095.6s)]
*  That could go in concert with rolling back parts of the ira. He'll almost certainly cut off additional funding to ukrainians [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1099.4399999999998s)]
*  That doesn't mean he can force them to take a deal, uh with putin [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1105.36s)]
*  But it seems like that's the path things are headed. So, um, I don't know. I think but I think that gaza [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1109.12s)]
*  Um, it was an inexplicable [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1116.0s)]
*  policy decision [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1119.12s)]
*  um [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1121.1999999999998s)]
*  Six months ago, let alone the just unequivocal support for netanyahu now i'll never understand it [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1122.1599999999999s)]
*  Neither till the day I die [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1127.84s)]
*  Yeah, look I think joe biden's more broadly it's like I think we don't know and we don't know in part because [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1131.12s)]
*  We don't know how bad this next trump term will be but [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1137.2s)]
*  the [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1141.04s)]
*  The fact that joe biden's term in which he wanted to restore the soul of the country and protect democracy is sandwiched by [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1142.0s)]
*  donald trump [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1149.6s)]
*  Uh is and and that will be in part because joe biden did not step down and waited so long [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1151.2s)]
*  to step aside [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1158.0s)]
*  is [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1159.52s)]
*  Right now the central [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1161.52s)]
*  Story of his presidency and that's a shame because he did a lot of really great things but [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1163.36s)]
*  Well, and that's the other difference between him and lbj because lbj decided not to run and step down much earlier [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1167.9199999999998s)]
*  Uh still wasn't enough for humphrey but um an argument that was used to keep joe biden in the race for a year about a year [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1175.04s)]
*  and a half [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1181.52s)]
*  But yeah, that's that's a tough part and just to clarify one thing [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1183.12s)]
*  I mean like early on the days after october 7th, of course like support for israel was the right thing [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1185.76s)]
*  Like i'm not i'm not saying that every step along the way he's been wrong [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1191.68s)]
*  but I mean the just utter inability to put any pressure on netanyahu to [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1194.24s)]
*  Save lives is is what i'm getting. Yeah, what because there's people who listen to show and [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1199.1200000000001s)]
*  you know send me texts about how [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1203.92s)]
*  Critical I am of netanyahu and the war and there's a lot of nuance to this, but I don't think [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1206.5600000000002s)]
*  Uh nuance is really required when you look at sort of the last [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1210.72s)]
*  few months and how clearly um [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1214.24s)]
*  Devastating this has become for the people in gaza. I also found myself especially when [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1217.68s)]
*  We were debating joe biden's age when joe biden was the candidate that one thing that I found myself saying was well [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1223.04s)]
*  You can't point to me a place where joe biden's age prevented him from succeeding domestically, right? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1228.48s)]
*  Like like he did what we asked him to do [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1232.96s)]
*  He passed more than anyone expected him to pass he played his hand domestically as well as any president [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1235.04s)]
*  Could have and that was one of the reasons it was actually so hard to challenge him if he refused to step aside [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1240.32s)]
*  But over the last year the fact that he is so [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1244.32s)]
*  such a terrible communicator [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1247.84s)]
*  When so much of what this has been about is communication has been like a really difficult part about it and I i I don't think [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1250.0s)]
*  This is communications. I think it's but I think it's both. It's obviously it's a policy problem, but it's all like [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1256.32s)]
*  I think one of the reasons well gaza gaza [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1262.6399999999999s)]
*  Galas is a policy problem. He's just saying writ large writ large [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1265.1999999999998s)]
*  He's been such an ineffective communicator and I think kamala paid dearly for the fact that we just didn't have somebody [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1268.08s)]
*  Making an argument for the final for the last year and like that was like a terrible [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1274.0s)]
*  A terrible cost and and and that's his fault. All right, so i'll put you guys down for a top five top 5% [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1278.8s)]
*  Bidco on twitter asks, do you worry that we won't see the same energy behind the anti-trump coalition as we did in 2017 going [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1285.6s)]
*  into 2025 [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1292.6399999999999s)]
*  When you answer a couple of these [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1294.48s)]
*  I mean, I think it'll I think a lot of it depends on [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1296.3999999999999s)]
*  On what trump does and it depends on what form the energy takes [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1299.2s)]
*  Like if trump does what he promised to do during the campaign and the anti-trump coalition reacts by like tuning out of politics [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1302.96s)]
*  Altogether or just fighting with each other the whole time. Um, yeah, then I would worry [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1308.72s)]
*  I also think the response to trump may be different this time because [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1312.88s)]
*  we have uh [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1317.2s)]
*  Learned what works and what doesn't you know, like we we have won a midterm when he's been president [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1318.72s)]
*  we have beaten him in a presidential election and [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1324.0s)]
*  I'd love to see you know, another huge women's march in january, but if it's smaller than before [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1327.52s)]
*  Like that doesn't really worry me if trump tries to take away our health care again or enact a national abortion ban [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1333.6s)]
*  Or order the military to shoot protest protesters and we don't organize and then like make noise and flood the streets [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1339.28s)]
*  In response to that. Yeah, then I would worry so some of it's just like lessons learned from having gone through this before [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1344.8799999999999s)]
*  And um, I could see some of those lessons just taking us in a different direction [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1351.44s)]
*  I would only worry if people just tune out altogether [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1355.7s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I mean I think we're sort of relying on the fact that like the hyper engaged [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1358.98s)]
*  voters [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1364.48s)]
*  That we thought would deliver the presidency are the reason we had faith in them was because they showed up in 2018 and 2022 [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1365.7s)]
*  We're kind of counting on that. I do think in terms of [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1371.38s)]
*  20 28 [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1375.2s)]
*  um [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1377.46s)]
*  I think one lesson of this race is counting on anti-trump or anti-republican fervor [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1378.82s)]
*  It just will not be enough and [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1383.7s)]
*  We need to have and we're not running against him again, and we're not running against him, of course [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1385.94s)]
*  but also like we just [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1389.94s)]
*  We need to be excited [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1392.42s)]
*  about the vision of whoever we put forward and we just can't just it has to [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1394.18s)]
*  We need to we need to we need to look inward [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1399.6200000000001s)]
*  Tommy I have a question for you from a zippy by day [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1401.94s)]
*  Okay, zippy by day also subscriber asks i'm beyond sick after 2024 [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1404.98s)]
*  The only thing worse is dem still hitting me up for money [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1409.38s)]
*  I feel like there's a culture issue with the dnc maybe politics in general [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1411.78s)]
*  But how do we become the party that doesn't come off as fake? [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1415.3s)]
*  So is the money parts the problem or the fakeness of the problem? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1418.74s)]
*  I was gonna say because both could be problems. I think both you know the money stuff [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1421.3799999999999s)]
*  Uh, I don't know who's who we take this up with [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1425.62s)]
*  You've been pitching democrat plus for a while where you just pay a flat fee and you don't get any more fundraising [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1430.18s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's worthy. But yeah, the fundraising has gotten offensive and infuriating and it's not just like uh, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1434.02s)]
*  um [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1439.86s)]
*  People like us thing. It's like you hear this from everyone you donate to one campaign and suddenly your [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1440.98s)]
*  Your contact information is sold on a list to every other interest group and it really does feel bad in a deeper way [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1445.8600000000001s)]
*  That's a huge problem. Can we make it an issue in the dnc chair race? That's a good idea. That's a good idea [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1452.26s)]
*  We should do that. Yeah, I think it like speaks to something. It's like it [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1456.98s)]
*  like it speaks to kind of the democratic party's problem writ large too, which is like [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1461.14s)]
*  Like really good at doing something doing the best version of something that sucks [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1466.8200000000002s)]
*  Like like that. We're really good at that [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1472.3400000000001s)]
*  Like let's figure out the best version of this thing that's not working and do it 100% [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1473.7s)]
*  And that's what we're doing with the fundraising and I do think it speaks to like the fakeness like it's like [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1478.18s)]
*  Like how like you're somebody that really cares about politics and you get a thousand texts [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1482.42s)]
*  It's like it's a keem jeffries. And if you don't do this, I will I swear I swear to god the things i'll do [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1486.3400000000001s)]
*  I know [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1491.54s)]
*  The post-election ones are just fucking that's just like a real how dare you I don't even know who these people are [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1494.1s)]
*  Let's start naming names [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1499.86s)]
*  Let's not uh, all right [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1502.02s)]
*  Uh another good one from uh subscriber jessica. I feel like we talk about supporting left media [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1504.42s)]
*  But the thing is that the biggest right wing podcasts slash media are all quote not political [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1509.62s)]
*  When you look at dave portnoy, I knew him as the guy who does pizza reviews and I knew andrew schultz as a decently funny comedian [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1515.1399999999999s)]
*  How do we go about getting left aligned non-political media? [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1520.9s)]
*  I mean there's a couple pieces of this. The first is something we've talked about a lot, which is that just the the [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1526.02s)]
*  Democrats should not be attacked for going on shows [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1530.74s)]
*  So if you go on a barstool show if you go on joe rogan, you are not responsible for your interviewer's views [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1533.22s)]
*  Obviously, there's limits to this. We're not recommending that [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1538.5s)]
*  2028 primary candidates go on the daily stormer [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1541.6s)]
*  Or like, you know, or even the daily wire. I mean do the daily wire. That's actually fine [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1544.9s)]
*  But I also think that there's another part of this [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1549.6200000000001s)]
*  It's a deeper problem, which was joe rogan and dave portnoy the head of barstool sports sports [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1551.14s)]
*  Felt excited enough or proud enough of supporting trump to talk about it publicly and there were a lot of progressive democrats [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1556.66s)]
*  in [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1563.8600000000001s)]
*  Places of influence in media in particular who did not feel that way part of that was gaza. I think part of it was biden [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1564.74s)]
*  Um, but there was a cultural shift where there are some [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1572.18s)]
*  Hosts i'm not going to name names because I don't want to be a dick to anybody but there's like [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1575.8600000000001s)]
*  some big named [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1579.22s)]
*  very popular culture or sort of [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1580.82s)]
*  Politics adjacent shows that would not take interviews with kamala harris. We know this from talking to her team [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1583.78s)]
*  Um, and part of it was [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1589.6200000000001s)]
*  They felt like they might be penalized by their audiences [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1591.94s)]
*  um [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1594.98s)]
*  They or they just felt like it wasn't fun or exciting and they just didn't want to be a part of it [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1596.02s)]
*  And that sucks even the way the question's phrased [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1601.3s)]
*  Left aligned non-political media. That's a it's that's a tough one [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1604.74s)]
*  Yeah, right. Like I think I think you're right like like time like you want to look for funny people [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1608.9s)]
*  Who aren't huge trump fans basically? [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1613.38s)]
*  but [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxra-3IH5xY&t=1615.94s)]
