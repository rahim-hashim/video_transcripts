Video Description: Apparently, there's an opposition party in this country—but they've been awfully quiet lately. Meanwhile, Trump's immigration crackdown nearly sparks a trade war with Colombia, and back at home, he's doing battle with his own  federal government—from loyalty tests to gutting diversity programs to pausing cancer research. Jon, Lovett, and Tommy break down which of the moves are the most dangerous, which are just for show, and why Democrats don’t seem to know what to say about it all. Then, they make their pick for who should be the next DNC chair. Later, Tommy sits down with Dara Lind, Senior Fellow at the American Immigration Council, to break down what's going on with deportations and immigration policy—and why it's more important than ever to pay attention.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

*  This is good content. We should use it for the show. All right, I [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  Think we're rolling [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=49.64s)]
*  Welcome to Pod save America. I'm John Favreau. I'm John love it [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=51.88s)]
*  I'm Tommy V torque on today's show Trump is making good on his promise to go to war with the federal government [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=54.54s)]
*  From loyalty screenings to dismantling diversity programs to pausing cancer research [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=59.24s)]
*  We'll talk about which moves are more performative in which you should actually worry about [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=63.72s)]
*  Democrats are finally beginning to talk and argue more openly about how to respond to all this craziness [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=68.6s)]
*  We'll go through what we think is productive [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=72.88s)]
*  What's a waste of time and how the race for DNC chair plays into all of it some news on that front stay tuned [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=74.6s)]
*  Then darlin long-time immigration journalists and now a senior fellow at the American immigration council stops by to talk to Tommy about what's really [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=81.08s)]
*  Happening with deportations and immigration policy and why it matters, but first [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=88.92s)]
*  Let's talk about the brief skirmish our president got us into with the Colombian government on Sunday [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=95.04s)]
*  One of our biggest allies in South America [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=99.48s)]
*  Basically Trump tried to send a few military planes carrying deported migrants to Colombia Colombia's leftist president [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  Gustavo Petro said not so fast [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=109.06s)]
*  His country would stop accepting these flights until the US could guarantee a process where the migrants were treated with dignity [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=111.94s)]
*  Apparently this was all in response to Trump's use of military aircraft for these transfers [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=119.3s)]
*  Colombia has allowed hundreds of flights carrying deported migrants on civilian aircraft under the Biden administration [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=124.17999999999999s)]
*  Trump was not too happy about this [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=130.85999999999999s)]
*  So he announced that the US would be retaliating [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=134.06s)]
*  With a 25% tariff on all goods coming into the US from Colombia, which would rise to 50% in one week [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=137.5s)]
*  Just a reminder. We buy a lot of coffee or flowers [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=144.38s)]
*  Oil from Colombia, so that would likely mean higher prices on those things [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=147.98s)]
*  Petro then threatened retaliatory tariffs of 25% on US goods imported to Colombia in a very long post [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=152.45999999999998s)]
*  where he also referred to Trump as a white slaver said that he'd rather die than give in and [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=160.5s)]
*  Confessed that although he finds the US a bit boring. He does like Walt Whitman Paul Simon and noam Chomsky [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=165.34s)]
*  It's okay. Let's get a good list. Yeah. Yeah, and then on Sunday evening. He did give in [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=170.95999999999998s)]
*  White House press secretary Caroline Levitt put out a statement saying Colombia had completely backed down that the tariffs would be held [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=176.66s)]
*  Quote in reserve and added quote today's events make clear to the world that America is respected again love it or love it and included [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=182.1s)]
*  a warning to all other countries not to make the same mistake I think the Colombians did say we did get some promises for better conditions for the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=189.98s)]
*  For the migrants coming back, but they got nothing they got nothing [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=199.98s)]
*  What'd you guys make of this as a governing strategy a foreign policy strategy and a political strategy? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=202.98s)]
*  I mean, it's like classic Trump right? He's the arsonists and the firefighter. You know, it's like Petro's an interesting guy [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=207.98s)]
*  He was a very interesting guy [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=214.22s)]
*  You know, it's like Petro's an interesting guy [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=216.42s)]
*  He was a he joined a Marxist [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=219.02s)]
*  Gorilla group as a teenager and then transitioned into politics. So he's not somebody who's scared to fight [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=221.85999999999999s)]
*  We all did crazy things as kids, you know, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We were wild [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=226.62s)]
*  Wild group this table a couple left-wing gorillas right here [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=230.74s)]
*  My mentions I sometimes have I do think Petro screwed up here a Trump a win he overreacted [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=236.54s)]
*  I think he claims that there was a video should name Chomsky [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=242.28s)]
*  Well, there was a deportation flight to Brazil that went viral on social media where people were handcuffed [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=246.56s)]
*  And then there was the news that the US is gonna use military aircraft to fly these deportation flights [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=252.12s)]
*  And I think a couple of Latin America experts [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=256.24s)]
*  I talked to think that Petra decided he could pick a fight here and it would help him politically and [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=258.92s)]
*  Then when people in Colombia realized that this might mean economic damage from tariffs or no visas for them to travel to the US [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=264.76s)]
*  They decided that was way worse and he backtracked very very quickly [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=272.64s)]
*  But I do think broadly from Trump like we're gonna see a lot of this picking fights with Democrats or leftists on immigration [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=276.08s)]
*  bullying small countries to get little wins and then acting like [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=283.6s)]
*  That wasn't a strategy available to every US president ever just to be a dick to Colombia [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=288.2s)]
*  But ultimately I think it's counterproductive and it raises questions about the US as a long-term ally [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=294.64s)]
*  The Chinese are already trying to capitalize on it. So it's just stupid nerd shit from Tommy. Oh, they're gonna capitalize it [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=299.52s)]
*  This was trumpet is bet. No [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=305.52s)]
*  Like what I saw over when I saw unfolding when I saw the folding what my honest first thought was it was like [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=307.15999999999997s)]
*  This couldn't have been scripted better for Trump. Yes, Trump hadn't paid this guy in Trump coins [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=312.79999999999995s)]
*  I thought that to the White House. They must have been like, are you fucking kidding me? This is awesome [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=318.76s)]
*  trade wars [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=323.4s)]
*  Tariffs a lot of what Trump is promising it's much easier to promise as a candidate because in reality there are terrible terrible [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=324.72s)]
*  trade-offs and by the way, there are also [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=332.48s)]
*  Terrible trade-offs and having a capricious [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=335.44000000000005s)]
*  American president like upending our reputation as a stable and safe ally like there is incredible [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=338.08000000000004s)]
*  Value for Americans day to day and having a president that is seen as a reliable partner because yes [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=344.8s)]
*  It may mean there are times we have to compromise and give with your partners, but you're a trading partner [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=351.44s)]
*  They can count on you're a country they can count on [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=356.28s)]
*  But he doesn't give a shit about any of that. So he gets this [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=359.08s)]
*  incredible easy win, right like [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=362.44s)]
*  Obviously like, you know, I saw people on social media [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=365.52s)]
*  We're like and you know our coffee is gonna be more expensive [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=367.52s)]
*  But like this is bullying you can bully a small country because they need us more than than we need them [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=369.88s)]
*  He knew that from the jump this guy caves [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=374.78s)]
*  It's just another great news cycle for Donald Trump and that that that was my takeaway [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=376.72s)]
*  I did see some people on social media various social media platforms [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=381.76s)]
*  like cheering on the Colombian president and quoting from his quoting from his statement of being like [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=386.16s)]
*  He's he's he's you know throwing down with Trump and look at this. I'm here for this. This is great [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=392.48s)]
*  And it's like guys, let's not this is not the way to this is not the way to respond to this [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=397.48s)]
*  I do want to talk about it in the context of like Trump [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=401.8s)]
*  Using tariffs as a threat to get what he wants from other countries which [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=406.24s)]
*  You know this situation made me realize. Oh, this is why he loves tariffs so much because each yeah, it's leverage [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=411.56s)]
*  He thinks he's gonna this is how he's gonna get his foreign policy objectives achieved [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=418.1s)]
*  According to Trump advisors who spoke to the Wall Street Journal [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=422.6s)]
*  Trump is quote very serious about hitting Mexico and Canada with 25 percent tariffs this Saturday [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=424.84000000000003s)]
*  February 1st even before any negotiations just wants to hit him with the tariffs [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=431.12s)]
*  Just to prove that he's not bluffing apparently the journal also reports that Mexico and Canada quote are quietly expressing confusion and bewilderment [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=436.04s)]
*  Because they aren't even sure what Trump wants [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=443.84000000000003s)]
*  What do you think's going on there? Have you ever seen the movie Marathon man? No [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=447.08000000000004s)]
*  In the movie Marathon man an evil Nazi dentist kidnaps [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=451.92s)]
*  Dustin Hoffman okay to demand answers and the movie is chilling and terrifying because because Dustin Hoffman actually genuinely does not have the answers [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=456.6s)]
*  he thought he thinks he's part of this plot, but he's not and [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=464.64s)]
*  That's what I thought about that's what happened to Canada. Yeah, that's that's currently what's happening to know Justin Trudeau [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=470.44s)]
*  Yeah, Dustin Hoffman could be true dough in a movie [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=475.41999999999996s)]
*  You see it. Yeah, well sure grow your hair out get some lifts look enough like cast. Yeah, you know [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=478.8s)]
*  The journal story mentions also that Canada has already pledged to spend nearly a billion dollars to harden its southern border with us [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=484.68s)]
*  Which is one of Trump's big demands and then Claudia Shane bomb the new president of Mexico has cracked down on migration through Mexico to our [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=491.68s)]
*  Southern border and done a much a high-profile drug seizure [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=498.16s)]
*  So Trump is getting what he wants from both of these presidents already [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=500.72s)]
*  And I guess and he's just gonna tariff them as a negotiating position [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=504.52000000000004s)]
*  I guess my reactions to this were one we probably shouldn't underestimate that there's a bunch of people in the White House [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=506.84000000000003s)]
*  That are bullies and assholes and want to wield power for the sake of just showing that they can and that could be what's happening here [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=512.88s)]
*  Tell us would you explain? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=519.56s)]
*  You know not telling someone what you want from them before you punish a sovereign country [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=521.28s)]
*  I also think it sounds like Trump is gonna try to renegotiate the USMCA agreement [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=525.4399999999999s)]
*  Which was what they called the renegotiated NAFTA. Yeah, which is just you know [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=530.6199999999999s)]
*  Renegotiated by a horrible president who let that get renegotiated [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=535.92s)]
*  Donald Trump's right and I think they're mad about it because they feel like I don't think Jared Kushner got that much out of that deal [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=538.88s)]
*  And then finally it's probably not a coincidence that we're talking about Trump messing with leftist and liberal [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=544.84s)]
*  Governments in Colombia Mexico in Canada in Canada in particular [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=551.4s)]
*  Trump is trying to soften up the Liberal Party as much as he can because they have an election my my like serious [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=555.12s)]
*  Reaction all this is like yeah [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=560.28s)]
*  It's probably be good if the Canadians knew what we wanted it would also be good if America [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=562.08s)]
*  Knew what we wanted as well because the question I have around what Trump has promised to do [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=565.96s)]
*  There's a lot of places where Trump has hit the ground and just started like putting in place big policy changes [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=571.46s)]
*  But actually hasn't really done that on tariffs [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=577.26s)]
*  He's promising an announcement on tariffs as soon as February 1 and he's threatening big tariffs on China on Mexico [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=579.74s)]
*  on on Canada on more sanctions on Russia to and [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=587.1s)]
*  Then you you know you dig into it and it's like well [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=590.9000000000001s)]
*  You know you want to support American car manufacturing one problem with that is a lot of parts that are that that are involved in [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=593.3000000000001s)]
*  Manufacturing cars in America come from Canada and come from Mexico. How will that impact our ability to make cars in the United States? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=598.98s)]
*  There are very there are very real implications and the details really matter and we don't have any of them [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=604.46s)]
*  And so I the broader question is is he going to it whatever he announces on February 1st [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=610.7s)]
*  If he announces anything at all, is it a big show with targeted tariffs more like what we saw in the first term? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=615.94s)]
*  Or is he serious? I just think we don't know [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=621.58s)]
*  My reaction is I wonder what's gonna happen when someone calls his bluff. It's like alright [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=624.1400000000001s)]
*  let's do it you like tariff us and then we're gonna we're gonna do retaliatory tariffs and [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=628.74s)]
*  Trump's bet is [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=633.66s)]
*  The political pain that he will face here from all of us having to pay higher prices because that's who'll pay for a trade [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=635.42s)]
*  war us [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=643.82s)]
*  Will be not as great as the political pain faced by the other leaders at home [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=645.5s)]
*  for the higher prices and the economic damage that they'll have to deal with from the trade war and that maybe [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=651.26s)]
*  The political pain here that he'll face will be short-lived because eventually those other countries will give in because they will they're probably [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=656.74s)]
*  Smaller countries or at least have a smaller economy because most countries in the world do right or the people just wanted to see him fight [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=664.9s)]
*  They don't necessarily care about the impact. It's also given to what right like this is just like tariff taking off [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=671.3s)]
*  Whatever weird thing he asked for right like who knows what he's gonna ask for but I think he just it's just to show [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=677.74s)]
*  It's a show of strength [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=684.02s)]
*  But I do think like I think at some point when you start pushing [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=686.06s)]
*  You know all of these allies and countries around you start like beating the shit out of them [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=689.98s)]
*  On tariffs like you're gonna like push them into the arms of China into the arms of like other countries like it just at some point [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=695.42s)]
*  Losing a bunch of allies is gonna come back to bite you in the ass [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=702.6999999999999s)]
*  It is the type of thing for Trump that like yeah, maybe not short-term short-term and everyone be like, oh, this is funny [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=705.18s)]
*  He like won a new cycle against Colombia, right? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=710.14s)]
*  But like, you know at some point you're gonna need those allies you've beaten up Colombia [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=712.1999999999999s)]
*  You're gonna try to annex Panama. You're gonna try to steal Greenland [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=715.9399999999999s)]

*  You know who's gonna notice it the Chinese and then I just long term [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=721.36s)]
*  My question through all this is how bad do the impacts of what Trump is doing on? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=724.86s)]
*  America have to be to overcome the advantages he has in [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=729.9399999999999s)]
*  How news is distributed and received right and how much his team will be on his side to argue that either things aren't happening [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=734.22s)]
*  Or they're not his fault or whatever. Maybe I mean that's gonna be limited by [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=741.28s)]
*  People paying higher prices, right? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=745.3s)]
*  If like if suddenly they this gets out of control with one of these countries and people start paying a lot more for whatever good [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=746.9s)]
*  Has is affected by the tariff then that's gonna then you know, it doesn't really it matters less what the what the media environment is [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=753.78s)]
*  Right, and you know as we just find out over the last four years and beyond and beyond tariffs, right? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=760.06s)]
*  Like, you know, everyone's everyone's like how's this gonna help the price of eggs? They're killing tens of millions of chickens now [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=763.68s)]

*  Which is now led by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth who squeaked by in a Senate vote where JD Vance had to break the tie on [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1044.5s)]

*  Dana and I went through some of the executive orders from the first week on Friday show [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1063.1799999999998s)]
*  But there's some other moves we should mention on Friday night Trump also fired more than a dozen [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1066.34s)]
*  Inspectors general those are independent watchdogs whose job it is to root out waste fraud and abuse and government agencies [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1072.06s)]
*  He has frozen most foreign aid even aid in the process of being handed out with the notable exception of military aid to Israel and Egypt [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1078.5s)]
*  He also said of Gaza that we should quote clean out the whole thing and have Gazans move to Egypt and Jordan [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1086.7s)]
*  Trump also put a pause on all travel communication and meetings at the National Institutes of Health [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1092.74s)]
*  Including grant review panels that greenlight funding for critical research into cancer and deadly diseases [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1097.78s)]
*  Though apparently the acting NIH director sent an email today and a memo trying to clear things up [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1102.82s)]
*  Said that clinical trials are still ongoing and that the restrictions don't apply to clinical trial participants or purchasing supplies for ongoing research [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1108.7s)]
*  But there's some confusion among researchers over what that means [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1117.26s)]
*  So there's a lot of just mayhem going on at the NIH was this incompetence were they trying to put a pause on this? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1120.9s)]
*  No one knows but I guess it was a really rough week for NIH researchers who were doing everything from you know [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1127.78s)]
*  Looking into cancer research and all kinds of other diseases and they had to sort of pause everything during this chaos [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1133.9s)]
*  And the CDC as I just mentioned has also been ordered to stop working with the World Health Organization [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1139.06s)]
*  Which we pulled out of thanks to Donald Trump [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1145.34s)]
*  Trump also fired or reassigned hundreds of government officials [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1148.3s)]
*  And is making others take MAGA loyalty tests in order to keep their jobs [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1151.82s)]
*  A bunch of people who did not pass the loyalty test all the people involved in investigating him [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1155.9s)]
*  For both January 6th and the classified documents case in the Department of Justice [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1161.98s)]
*  They they were all fired just just today on Monday. You think it would be that hard to just make it through one episode of gut felt [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1166.94s)]
*  Your eyes just pried open my clock exactly [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1174.54s)]
*  Tommy passed the loyalty test. Yeah, but by sitting through a Jesse Waters interview [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1177.5800000000002s)]
*  Bone structure [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1181.74s)]
*  He's a head set guy this guy [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1184.02s)]
*  Tommy and what's uh, where to begin? What's most alarming to you guys of all that? Oh, we're ranking [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1186.74s)]
*  We're choosing our favorites just something that's stuck out at you when you read it when you read it all something was like [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1192.9s)]
*  there's a great episode of strict scrutiny about some of these orders that you should listen to you, but what jumped out at me and [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1197.06s)]
*  what they [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1203.06s)]
*  talked about as well is [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1205.18s)]
*  These they're they're calling a DI it's obviously going much further than that people talked about that's going deep into just the [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1207.5800000000002s)]
*  Like rules that have been a bit in place since Lyndon Johnson to protect basic civil rights is going after civil rights rules [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1215.74s)]
*  There's an EO [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1222.3s)]
*  that was about [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1223.8600000000001s)]
*  Federal contracting and making sure there's no discrimination among federal in federal contracting that was signed by Lyndon Johnson [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1226.22s)]
*  That was part of the equal opportunity employment act [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1231.6200000000001s)]
*  But what really jumped out is the ways in which it is empowering government agencies to and by the way private citizens to go after [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1233.86s)]
*  private companies that may have [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1241.1s)]
*  DEI policies because if you're going to become a federal contractor you have to assent to [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1243.58s)]
*  Certain statements in these EOs that could make you liable and it's gonna make a lot of these companies [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1249.86s)]
*  Afraid that their diversity policies run afoul of this [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1254.5s)]
*  They're a government contractor a private citizen can claim this is an abuse of the federal contracting system [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1258.3s)]
*  Which they're legally allowed to do and it's another example of trying to kind of in that it's it's a part of an ideological [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1262.72s)]
*  Trend right it goes has to do with the same as like the the don't say gay bill in Florida [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1268.6000000000001s)]
*  Which is you empower private citizens to be a watchdog and you basically [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1272.84s)]
*  Tried to intimidate private individuals private companies [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1278.2s)]
*  For fear of being sued and dragged into court the bounty law in Texas [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1282.16s)]
*  There's just other examples of this and they're implementing that now in these federal contracting rules [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1286.1200000000001s)]
*  I think why the Supreme Court affirmative action ruling comes into play here, too [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1289.76s)]
*  Is that some of these companies that are now sort of rolling back DEI programs are? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1293.16s)]
*  And have been concerned for a little while since that supreme since the Supreme Court decision which was about [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1299.36s)]
*  universities and colleges and admissions process that that maybe their policies run afoul of the Supreme Court decision and now [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1304.8s)]
*  Trump doing this only strengthens that did you guys see that the Trump administration they set up an email account where you can snitch on [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1313.24s)]
*  Whatever entities companies whatever in fact you're encouraged to DEI [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1319.44s)]
*  But now it's getting mass spammed with just nonsense and bullhorn love it. Yeah, that's great [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1323.3600000000001s)]
*  That DEI a truth at OPM a is accessibility as well some it's DEI and be real shame disabled [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1328.72s)]
*  workers catches fucking strays [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1336.8400000000001s)]
*  Jesus [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1339.72s)]
*  It's also it's like you have to [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1341.0800000000002s)]
*  They are now so a lot of people in the right include a lot of people in the Trump administration [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1343.4s)]
*  you know they've started to like [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1346.76s)]
*  It's a slippery slope on how they're defining DEI now now [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1348.76s)]
*  It's like oh that the head of the Coast Guard is a woman she's focused on the DEI [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1352.0s)]
*  Yeah, get her out of there [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1356.92s)]
*  They hated that they hated that California lesbian fire chief until she started making fun of mayor Bass and then they were like we're back in [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1357.92s)]
*  That's a back in stuff bring up the lesbian fire chiefs. That's something we agree with so everybody chill out [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1362.76s)]
*  Yeah, the US military though is a good example of an organization that needs an effective DEI program because if you look at [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1366.42s)]
*  Across the US military the proportion of black service members [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1372.68s)]
*  It's well over represents the total US population [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1375.8600000000001s)]
*  But they are wildly underrepresented at the general officer level especially like the three-star four-star level [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1379.74s)]
*  It's extremely white and extremely male at the very top and that's because of overt racism in some cases or just like structural [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1385.78s)]
*  problems or cultural challenges in other cases and should be fixed and could be fixed but like Tom Cotton is mad that an [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1392.46s)]
*  Army unit had to read a Robin D Angelo book one time and they are just like throwing out the entire program and [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1399.38s)]
*  The result is we're not allowed to teach people about the Tuskegee Airmen anymore for like 24 hours [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1405.74s)]
*  It's just a stupid overreach. Yeah, well, maybe no more Robin D Angelo books is probably [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1410.46s)]
*  It's just like it's like this is but this is throw them at the enemy [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1415.7s)]
*  This is the challenge it's like it is clear that in workplaces in government that [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1420.38s)]
*  People of color and women are just have not been represented because of historic racism and structural inequality [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1426.9s)]
*  That we have faced for decades and decades and then I think what happened is a lot of these DEI programs not only [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1432.1s)]
*  So we focused on making sure that there were diverse [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1437.6599999999999s)]
*  Workforces and that we're focusing on diversity in hiring and pay and promotion [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1442.1s)]
*  But also these like unconscious bias training programs, which I think is what rubbed [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1446.6399999999999s)]
*  Quite a few people the wrong way who aren't just mega for sure [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1451.3799999999999s)]
*  It's just the proportion of time spent on those programs in the US military compared to everything else [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1453.98s)]
*  They're doing is zero and if this is just a wild overreach no and that's stupid [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1458.9s)]
*  Well, that's like Chris Rufo and all those assholes [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1463.42s)]
*  They decided to highlight all that stuff and so then made people think the DEI is that and not just [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1466.02s)]
*  Trying to have equitable workforces, which we've wanted to have for a long long time and have it you see this right? [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1471.3000000000002s)]
*  Like they they they banned DI then all of a sudden the Tuskegee Airmen are out of some [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1476.3400000000001s)]
*  training and [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1481.9s)]
*  We should tell we should explain that a little bit because you just kind of mentioned it quickly [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1483.3000000000002s)]
*  But it's the Tuskegee Airmen [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1486.86s)]
*  Because of the just let's eliminate all DEI [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1489.1399999999999s)]
*  There was a directive sent out that people that that people in the military could no longer even learn about the Tuskegee Airmen [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1492.9799999999998s)]
*  or other groups of [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1501.1399999999999s)]
*  Underrepresented people who have done like, you know heroic things in the military [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1504.1s)]
*  Heroes World War two heroes, right? There's also the women air force service pilots or the Wasps [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1508.82s)]
*  That that video was gone for that he was gone for a while too and then after like 24 hours everyone was like [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1514.44s)]
*  Oh, I guess I guess that's okay to teach [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1520.04s)]
*  I guess we could bring that back [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1522.92s)]
*  Yeah, first of all when I saw wasps was like they've banned teaching about wasps like I thought those weren't minorities [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1524.1599999999999s)]
*  I thought this is America. You can't teach about Tommy Tommy's hit hard [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1529.0s)]
*  Taking out the training video, but I'm catching straight [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1532.8s)]
*  Over again, like you see these executive orders are political documents. They are not written to govern [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1536.0s)]
*  So you have this what so they put out this this [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1541.84s)]
*  Overreaching rule and nobody really knows exactly how to implement it [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1545.6399999999999s)]
*  They're afraid of getting on the wrong side and and getting drawn into Trump's evil eye [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1548.32s)]
*  You see the this rule about nobody at the NIH being allowed to communicate like does that mean we can't pay our bills? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1552.22s)]
*  Does that mean we have to stop research like no, no, no, no, no, and it's all kind of now [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1557.6s)]
*  Is it intended to make people feel? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1561.8799999999999s)]
*  Intimidated unsure. Is it just incompetence? It doesn't really matter. It shows a lack of care. It's a fecklessness [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1565.3999999999999s)]
*  Well in the but importantly, I think the effect is yes that it's gonna make people feel like here's the long-term price [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1570.64s)]
*  It's a it may be invisible to most Americans in the short term [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1577.48s)]
*  But long term this is gonna bite us in the ass because who's gonna want to work in government now [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1581.2800000000002s)]
*  Who's gonna want to work in the federal government and not like women are gonna feel like they they're not included [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1585.0s)]
*  People of color are gonna feel like they're not included [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1590.5200000000002s)]
*  You know black people Latino people like this is gonna go but also [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1592.5200000000002s)]
*  Like there are people at every level of federal government who are being fired right now who are experts in their field [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1595.72s)]
*  But because they're not MAGA loyalists, they can't work in the federal government [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1601.0s)]
*  Who's gonna want to work at the National Institute of Health? [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1604.6000000000001s)]
*  Like a lot of these people go get private sector jobs pay them a lot of money like who's gonna work [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1606.44s)]
*  It's we're gonna hollow out the federal government now, which a lot of you know, I realize a lot of voters think federal government [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1611.2800000000002s)]
*  What does it do for me? It's big big and bloated and wasteful and blah blah [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1617.2s)]
*  These are people who are doing like important research medical research [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1619.88s)]
*  These are people with the lawyers at the Department of Justice [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1622.92s)]
*  There was some there was there's a program where people out of law school [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1625.5s)]
*  We're getting like really good law school students and their third year at law school got all these they had got grants and they were had [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1629.0800000000002s)]
*  Jobs in the Department of Justice and they just froze all of those jobs and like all those people are out of work now [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1634.3600000000001s)]
*  I saw a doctor talking about this on social media and I found it really [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1639.74s)]
*  like [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1645.6000000000001s)]
*  Heartbreaking which he said [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1646.92s)]
*  You know if you have us a member your family who has a very serious illness that they may not survive and you're at the [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1649.68s)]
*  Doctor's office and you're saying you have to try something you have to try something [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1655.46s)]
*  Isn't there anything you can do and there's like the anything you can do the last-ditch thing you can try are the kinds of research [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1657.72s)]
*  That happened at the National Institutes of Health and then you and and like Trump doesn't care about that [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1663.76s)]
*  These people don't care about that. They just want to destroy [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1667.88s)]
*  They just want to destroy these institutions like even the trans ban like I remember when the first trans ban for military service went out [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1670.04s)]
*  And at the time it just talks about how much things have changed everyone was outraged in part because it was done [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1676.2s)]
*  So haphazardly it was just issued. It wasn't clear how it was gonna be implemented [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1681.44s)]
*  It wasn't sure what it would mean for current service members [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1684.96s)]
*  You look at this document that they've put out and it's still not clear what they're talking about [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1688.0800000000002s)]
*  Right because they say oh the military will no longer for readiness [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1693.3200000000002s)]
*  You can't have people who are in transition and oh by the way, you can't use the pronouns of your choice [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1696.88s)]
*  But what about service members who transition long ago, right and have been serving? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1702.24s)]
*  Their country with distinction this entire time [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1705.8s)]
*  Is it because they were using the wrong pronouns? What if they use the pronouns that you demand for them? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1708.88s)]
*  Are they allowed to stay? How does this get implemented? They don't care. They don't care what this does because they don't care about service [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1712.92s)]
*  They don't care about these basic values [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1719.2s)]
*  And so they throw us all they throw these soldiers to the wolves because they don't they're they're ideologically inconvenient [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1721.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're just it's just broad. They're just sweeping everything off the table [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1726.92s)]
*  They're freezing all foreign aid except for things that directly support Israel's security [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1730.24s)]
*  Well, that means that you know the times that piece over the weekend about how the the the State Department office that funds the cleanup [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1734.08s)]
*  Of unexploded bombs all over the world now has to cease operations [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1740.56s)]
*  So what happens usually when you have a cluster munition and 10% of it doesn't go off. It's called a dud [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1744.3999999999999s)]
*  They just sit around and you know [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1749.8s)]
*  It finds them little kids and they pick them up and they fucking play with them because they look interesting and they blow off their [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1751.12s)]
*  Arm and that's who's gonna get hurt by these programs and it's like why did we need to pause on? [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1755.84s)]
*  The cleanup of unexploded ordinance like there's no there's no ideological viewpoint on that it's crazy [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1760.8400000000001s)]
*  How about everything we're funding overseas for like helping with disease and and HIV and all this like oh, yeah [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1766.76s)]
*  They've pep far just pep. Yeah, I'll just frozen and like successful Republican initiatives ever who knows [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1772.8000000000002s)]
*  You know, it's early and maybe this all gets started back up and the pause ends and like a couple weeks [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1778.8400000000001s)]
*  But what what was this for right? We're just gonna hurt a bunch of people in the meantime [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1783.3200000000002s)]
*  No, it was I forget what it was some US senator found out that like some tiny fraction of money like [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1786.84s)]
*  6-grand out of like tens of billions of dollars was used for abortion services [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1794.6s)]
*  And I think that led them to just unravel the entire program. It's crazy. Apparently they just put all the top [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1799.84s)]
*  officials at USAID on leave [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1807.28s)]
*  Just just got rid of all of them. I'd like career people not even not even political appointees. Yes, Jim Risch of Idaho [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1810.72s)]
*  figured out that something like [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1816.8s)]
*  $4,100 [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1820.28s)]
*  Had been spent by the government in Mozambique on abortions that money was already funded, but they've put the entire pep far programming in jeopardy [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1821.48s)]
*  Yeah, so we were gonna pick out the worst but it's pretty much all of them. It's pretty it's pretty bad [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1830.12s)]
*  It's pretty bad the war on the government [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1835.2s)]
*  I it's it's so frustrating and infuriating because I do think [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1836.8799999999999s)]
*  This is a hard one to break through to most people right like, you know in the what's gonna be [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1841.12s)]
*  Most effective to talk about politically pile right like his war on the federal government [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1846.48s)]
*  I don't think is gonna be high up there, but it is extremely damaging and again next time there's a pandemic [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1852.4s)]
*  What's gonna happen? [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1858.76s)]
*  It's gonna happen. Yeah, or some other crisis or some other disaster where we need the federal government to protect Americans [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1860.28s)]
*  Yeah, well we can talk about how to react to all this [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1866.76s)]
*  Politically, I guess we can just I can I can hold my fire. Yeah, well where we're there look at that [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1870.1200000000001s)]
*  Apparently there is another political party in this country. They're known as the Democrats Democrats. That's right [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1875.28s)]
*  I've never heard it said though. We haven't we haven't read it. We haven't heard much from them lately [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1881.0s)]
*  Politico had a good piece about how much more low-key the resistance to Trump is this time around [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1885.4399999999998s)]
*  It noted that almost none of the top early contenders for the 2028 Democratic nomination had put out statements about the January 6th pardons or [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1890.32s)]
*  Elon Musk's salute whatever it was [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1897.84s)]
*  Lots of quotes in the story mostly from anonymous strategists great about how Democrats are quote rudderless and over learning their lessons [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1901.76s)]
*  In general, there is still a lot of backward-looking recriminations about what we did wrong in last year's election [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1909.04s)]
*  As evidenced by this viral clip of Stephen A Smith on Bill Maher the other night. Let's listen. Here's the deal [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1914.6399999999999s)]
*  The man was impeached twice. He was convicted on 34 felony camps and the American people still said [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1921.1599999999999s)]
*  He's closer to normal than what we exactly left. That's what they say. He's closer to normal why because [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1928.48s)]
*  Something that pertains when you talk about the transgender community [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1935.52s)]
*  For example, and you're talking about the issues that pertain to less than 1% of the population [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1937.8799999999999s)]
*  The Democratic Party came of course as if that was a priority more so than the other issues [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1941.8799999999999s)]
*  And so he comes in the office now you're talking about child, you know, you know childbirth citizenship and what-have-you [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1945.9199999999998s)]
*  He knows that's not gonna pass the mustard, but he knows that he made that promise [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1950.52s)]
*  So when he shows up week one on Capitol Hill and he says this is what we're going to do through an executive order [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1954.3999999999999s)]
*  Even though it's gonna be shot down through the courts and what-have-you [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1960.36s)]
*  He's saying I kept my promise a lot of other things that he's gonna point to that [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1962.9599999999998s)]
*  He's gonna try to do I kept my promise then you turn around and you look at the left and you say what promises did [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1967.0s)]
*  You keep now you might know the answer to that [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1972.02s)]
*  I'm certainly not questioning your knowledge about that at all [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1973.76s)]
*  What I'm saying is what resonated with the view with the voter what voter out there can look at the Democratic Party at this moment [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1976.08s)]
*  And say there's a voice for us somebody that speaks for us that goes up on Capitol Hill and fights the fights that we want [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1982.28s)]
*  Them fighting on our behalf they didn't do that [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1988.64s)]
*  And that's why they're behind the home and that man is back into the White House and they want to sit up there [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1991.2s)]
*  So you look at the networks right now. They're talking about look at it. This is the latest look at him here [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1996.16s)]
*  He goes again. Well, you know what here he goes again means he's doing what he said he was gonna do [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=1999.88s)]
*  He promised you he was gonna do these things and he walked in the office week one [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2005.16s)]
*  That's exactly what he's doing and he said y'all do something about it and when you try to do something about it [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2009.44s)]
*  He's gonna say look at them now now they're concerned about these issues. What are you talking about that during the campaign? Hell? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2014.6000000000001s)]
*  No, that's really it. So what'd you guys think of Stephen a's argument there? [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2019.2800000000002s)]
*  I get why this went viral [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2023.94s)]
*  I get that it resonates on an emotional level for some people because we're all mad at Democrats because we got our asses kicked [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2026.0800000000002s)]
*  And we're not about the election. We're mad about Joe Biden, but he's just so wrong on so many different levels. I mean Republicans [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2031.24s)]
*  Democrats didn't make the whole election about trans rights [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2038.3600000000001s)]
*  Republicans ran tens of millions of dollars of attack ads on TV attacking Kamala Harris on this issue [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2041.08s)]
*  That's why it was salient and then Stephen is because of what she said [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2047.3600000000001s)]
*  in 2019 not in 2024 [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2051.68s)]
*  And then Stephen a's definition of Trump keeping his promise is put putting forward an executive order on birthright citizenship [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2054.32s)]
*  That he knows will get struck down in court [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2062.0s)]
*  That is not how Joe Biden was judged like when Biden foot put forward a student loan forgiveness plan and it got struck down [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2064.2799999999997s)]
*  By a Republican Supreme Court everyone got mad at Joe Biden and said he was feckless [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2070.24s)]
*  like I'm not here to make excuses for Democrats or Biden or Harris or say the campaign was good, but it's like [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2074.04s)]
*  It's a 50-50 electorate. There was an anti-incumbency wave Trump is not delivering for the American people in some profound way right now [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2080.2s)]
*  It's just all vibes and like I get the vibes in the anger driving them [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2088.52s)]
*  But it's just like he's like he points to Ro Khanna's like you might know all the details of the things Joe Biden [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2092.1s)]
*  Promised and did deliver on I didn't bother to Google them and it's just like come on, man. Yeah [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2098.2999999999997s)]
*  It's so frustrating right because you see that clip and you're like, well, let's break it down, right? [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2103.58s)]
*  let's explain all the ways with that this is wrong, right all the ways in which actually Joe Biden delivered on a lot of his promises and [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2107.66s)]
*  Donald Trump failed in his first term on virtually every promise that he made other than cutting taxes for the richest people [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2113.62s)]
*  That Joe Biden had more deportations while he was president than Donald Trump had while he was president, right? [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2118.94s)]
*  there's a lot of ways to break it down what was interesting to me about the clip is like [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2124.38s)]
*  we're that that you see like a kind of [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2128.26s)]
*  Conventional wisdom kind of taking hold in real time and you see like this kind of this [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2131.1000000000004s)]
*  Bill Maher says exactly and the whole audience [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2136.94s)]
*  applauds and [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2140.5s)]
*  I've tried to think like if Kamala Harris had won like what is the list of big executive orders? [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2142.2200000000003s)]
*  She could have signed in the first day that would have had like rapturous applause was like she's fucking doing it [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2147.3s)]
*  She's delivering on what she said. She's gonna do it's happening [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2151.34s)]
*  It's happening and like that's not to say that like that that part of that is just the failures of incumbency, right? [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2153.94s)]
*  Like well, I was gonna say it would feel different because she would have taken office not after four years of the other party [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2159.0600000000004s)]
*  You just unravel what the other guy just did [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2165.98s)]
*  That's what all these EOs are and there was a little bit of that when Biden won [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2167.78s)]
*  Right and then remember the first week by back in Paris. We [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2170.7000000000003s)]
*  Know fires [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2177.34s)]
*  but what I the reason I bring that up is only to say like yes it is different when you're trying to run to [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2178.0600000000004s)]
*  Replace someone in your own party versus replace some of the opposite party [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2182.42s)]
*  But like I think back to 2006 and I remember all the Democrats campaigning [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2184.94s)]
*  for the house and they had their like checklist of the things that they were gonna do if they won and the things that were [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2189.02s)]
*  gonna stop it they did the [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2193.46s)]
*  anti-corruption measures raising the minimum wage there's a whole list of simple to understand policies and [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2194.54s)]
*  Like forget. Yes. Look we asked we have asked and answered we paid in blood for Joe Biden [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2200.32s)]
*  Giving up the bully pulpit like yes now we're talking about all these Democrats kind of overthinking [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2206.18s)]
*  How are we gonna respond to this? [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2211.14s)]
*  let's get out the abacus and like move the move the move the [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2212.5s)]
*  Move the beads around to figure out the perfect response and I can't possibly start speaking until I know exactly [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2215.38s)]
*  What my overall vision is for the future of the country and like isn't is that the lesson you draw from the last four years? [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2220.26s)]
*  Get the fuck out there get out there start responding tell the truth [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2225.5s)]
*  How about that? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2228.78s)]
*  Like you're asked about what you think about the general the January 6 pardons [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2229.46s)]
*  Tell us what you think of them you're worried about what's happening at the National Institute of Health [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2232.38s)]
*  Tell us what you're thinking about it [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2236.46s)]
*  You're you don't leave the field and build some playbook for how to respond and defeat Donald Trump you get out there [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2237.94s)]
*  And you start doing it you see what works you see what doesn't like like we need like that whole piece like and they're good [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2245.2200000000003s)]
*  Like that whole piece was just a bunch of people kind of trying to like we're gonna crack the code finally [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2251.02s)]
*  Yeah, the political piece was just all about how we're gonna crack this fucking code and it's like guys [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2257.0600000000004s)]
*  Everybody's applauding Stephen a Smith for this like this this rant of like basically easy to refute nonsense. Where are we? [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2261.2200000000003s)]
*  Here's what here's what I found frustrating about the Stephen a Smith thing is it it sort of pulls you in [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2267.6200000000003s)]
*  and your first instinct is to [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2274.06s)]
*  like [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2276.7400000000002s)]
*  Tick off why all the reasons it's wrong right like you were saying because you want to defend right and then suddenly you find yourself like [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2277.98s)]
*  Defending Joe Biden's record for four years, which by the way, there was a lot of good things [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2284.2200000000003s)]
*  We've said this and also saying things like guess what Joe Biden didn't really couldn't really control inflation, right? [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2287.62s)]
*  That was that was you know, and also Republicans picked out a bunch of culture and identity issues that yes Democrats gave them some ammo on [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2292.42s)]
*  but [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2300.18s)]
*  They get more attention in this information environment culture and identity issues than the fights that we want to pick as Democrats [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2301.66s)]
*  right so you can explain away why this happened and yet that perception is real about the party and [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2307.4s)]
*  So you don't want to just be like running against the perception that's there [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2313.42s)]
*  And so like I don't know all you can say to Stephen a Smith is like, you know what? [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2317.34s)]
*  Yeah, we want people want Democrats [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2321.82s)]
*  They don't people don't want excuses [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2324.2200000000003s)]
*  they want politicians who are gonna actually go out there and fight for them and like and give a damn and look look like they [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2325.42s)]
*  Give a shit and not look like they are reading [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2331.2200000000003s)]
*  I said this on Fridays pause Dan's line, but like reading the fucking stage directions already [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2333.6800000000003s)]
*  I feel like I feel like sometimes giving messaging advice to Democrats is like giving fucking kids matches [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2338.82s)]
*  You know, it's like you say something about like inflation and the cost of living and suddenly they're all out there being like that's not [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2343.62s)]
*  Gonna do anything to lower the price of eggs. It's like come on make it fucking believable guys [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2348.96s)]
*  It's not believable right now [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2354.4s)]
*  No one is out there thinking that Donald Trump was gonna lower the price of eggs or lower the cost of everything after a fucking week [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2356.14s)]
*  I think that [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2362.0s)]
*  What was annoying about some of the statements you guys talked about was you're right? [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2364.22s)]
*  You don't have to combine the cost of eggs and January 6 pardons. It's it's bad to pardon [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2367.02s)]
*  Insurrectionists that beat up cops what I think I found so annoying about Stephen is kind of the end of his rant is he was [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2371.7799999999997s)]
*  criticizing Democrats for [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2378.94s)]
*  Criticizing Trump or trying to block Trump or being an opposition party and it's like in 2008 when Barack Obama won [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2380.98s)]
*  365 electoral votes to the Republicans just like lay down arms and give up [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2387.2599999999998s)]
*  No, they filibustered every single thing we did. That's the role of an opposition party [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2391.02s)]
*  You're gonna disagree with the president and you're gonna talk about it [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2394.94s)]
*  And he's in he like makes them sound like they're just out there carping when the reality is that they're not really actually saying much [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2397.42s)]
*  Say anything. Yeah trans issues keep coming up and then people like it's 1% of the population. It's 1% of population [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2403.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's a tiny group of people [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2408.86s)]
*  that are scared to go to the bathroom at the airport and [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2411.66s)]
*  like [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2415.7400000000002s)]
*  Republicans have made trans issues the center of our politics, but I will say like [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2417.34s)]
*  You know John made the point look well, it's based on something she said in 2019 [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2423.1s)]
*  But it's I do think it's more than that and it is a larger credibility issue [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2426.36s)]
*  right like if Democrats had more credibility broadly with the American people on the big issues the economy on like the cost of [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2430.04s)]
*  living on on [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2437.8s)]
*  Education on health care whatever it is if Democrats had earned credibility [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2439.6s)]
*  They were seen as fighters as champions for the people we need to be fighters and champions for there would be more space to say [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2442.8s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2448.0s)]
*  We may not agree on trans issues you may not be where I'm at yet [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2448.6400000000003s)]
*  But I'm gonna fight for trans people every goddamn day and this has been the case for decades [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2451.38s)]
*  This used to be the case with abortion right when abortion was [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2455.16s)]
*  Not when the pro-choice position was not as popular as it is now and there were Democrats who would be in in red or rural [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2458.96s)]
*  Districts and they'd say to share Brown always would tell stories like this. He would take about guns, right? [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2465.8799999999997s)]
*  He has a story, you know, hi where he's talking to these people and they're like, you know [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2470.08s)]
*  Well, I don't like your position on on guns, right? [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2473.72s)]
*  I think you know, I want to keep my gun [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2476.18s)]
*  But I like you because you're for me and you're even fighting like hell for me, you know [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2477.7599999999998s)]
*  And so like you're absolutely right about that it's like right now [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2482.42s)]
*  It is overthinking every single thing if people don't believe you when you [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2486.7400000000002s)]
*  Are talking about the economy or issues they really care about you're because you sound like you're reading from a script [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2492.6600000000003s)]
*  You sound like you sound like a normal politician. They're not gonna come along with you when you disagree [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2498.1400000000003s)]
*  They're not gonna trust you [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2502.1800000000003s)]
*  when you see things a different way part of the whole price of eggs thing is the Democrats aren't saying what like we want Trump to [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2503.6200000000003s)]
*  do or what we would do and [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2509.8s)]
*  You know when they spent four years attacking Joe Biden for all kinds of bullshit [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2512.1600000000003s)]
*  They would say things that you know, I didn't believe like Trump would say I'm gonna do tariffs and that's gonna fix them [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2515.36s)]
*  So I'm gonna drill drill drill [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2519.96s)]
*  If we cannot go around for the next year just saying that did not lower the price of eggs [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2521.52s)]
*  That is not fucking sufficient [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2525.76s)]
*  And you know why it's not sufficient because people aren't gonna believe it because it's not believable to just go around saying that all [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2527.04s)]
*  The time like have a have a story you tell about [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2531.6400000000003s)]
*  What working people are facing in this country what we should do for working people how we're gonna make sure that everyone who works and actually [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2535.0800000000004s)]
*  Like pay their bills and chill like have a whole fucking story about it. It just sounds bitchy [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2541.48s)]
*  It does it's like people are just not stupid. He's been president a week, you know, it's gonna take a minute [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2545.12s)]
*  I like I have a little more sympathy for Democrats. He just took office [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2550.2000000000003s)]
*  We're probably not hearing like Pat Ryan has did a bunch of Twitter threads talk to playbook over the weekends [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2553.96s)]
*  Congressman from New York saying some smart thoughtful interesting things. So that was framing good focus, right? People are saying the right thing [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2559.2000000000003s)]
*  There's just no leader. There's no megaphone. Nobody's getting picked up. No one's getting hurt [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2564.8s)]
*  It's just the Trump show all day every day, but there's also not a lot of emotion, you know, like I've seen Democrats [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2568.56s)]
*  You know you or you give like a floor speech in the Senate [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2575.4s)]
*  That's not going anywhere or you're doing a video where you're talking about why this is it's like [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2578.32s)]
*  Even the it was interesting even the way the politico story was framed how it's like they didn't [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2583.2s)]
*  Democrats didn't do statements on the Elon Musk thing or the J6 pardons because they were big they connected those both and I'm like [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2587.6s)]
*  Those are nothing like one matters and one does that's what I was [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2593.88s)]
*  Right that you one must think it's like we're gonna say you did a Nazi salute. He's gonna say no [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2596.64s)]
*  I didn't the conversation dies there [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2600.28s)]
*  It's like what do you you're gonna win the great debate about whether he did the Nazi salute or not [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2602.2s)]
*  Then what happens he goes away. He disappears [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2606.16s)]
*  About his AFD rally. That's a lot more relevant [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2608.76s)]
*  Also, I just had a time story the Trump administration has instructed organizations in other countries to stop dispersing HIV medications [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2610.68s)]
*  Purchased with the USAID even if the drugs have already been obtained in our sitting in local clinics [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2617.04s)]

*  And that was that was part of that. This is just PEPFAR PEPFAR saved 25 million lives [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2638.5600000000004s)]
*  And we're letting these drugs just sit on a shelf [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2642.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2644.88s)]
*  I do want to say like the the January 6 pardons though like not speaking about that is [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2645.2400000000002s)]
*  Crazy to me because like most importantly they are [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2650.7999999999997s)]
*  dangerous and that they give right-wing extremists a [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2654.7599999999998s)]
*  Green light to go commit political violence even against law enforcement because hey Trump's got their back, right? [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2656.8399999999997s)]
*  But they're also extremely unpopular even if you just want to be political about it [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2662.12s)]
*  They're popular so why wouldn't you go out to the microphone somewhere and be outraged about that? [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2665.9599999999996s)]
*  And then I know that I'm glad all the Democrats are signed on to a resolution [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2670.68s)]
*  condemning the the the pardoning for the J6 it's like it's [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2675.56s)]

*  He's not signing on to this so then he signed on so it was fine [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2719.52s)]
*  And then someone asked John Fetterman, I guess just just a couple hours ago. Why didn't you sign on at first? [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2722.36s)]
*  He's like no no no I was out look he was like I've been against [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2727.0s)]
*  Parts for January 6 insurrection is forever. I've been on record [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2729.6800000000003s)]
*  But I do think what we need is another another performative more performance art where we pass another resolution that'll really [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2732.7599999999998s)]
*  That'll really get him and it's like yeah, okay, okay, buddy [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2738.66s)]
*  You were your life is performance art you wear shorts and hoodies to like the Senate floor to like send a message [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2741.92s)]
*  Come on [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2747.4s)]
*  But I do get where it's like I would rather have Democrats have gone to the mic [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2747.8399999999997s)]
*  The morning after it happened with the j-6 thing and like all of them [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2752.2s)]
*  With with Capitol Police officers with everyone else and like shown some real emotion [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2756.08s)]
*  Than I would an official resolution that passed well, I just think it's very easy to do both [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2759.74s)]
*  Yeah, I think the problem though is it's a really what you're saying [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2764.2999999999997s)]
*  It's not so therefore our strategy should be to look for opportunities to show emotion and really what we're saying [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2766.7s)]
*  It's like it's reading the stage directions. Just fucking do it right what we want is somebody who sees this happening unfolding [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2770.8999999999996s)]
*  It is like fuck. I gotta get out there. This is terrible. I'm gonna go to the [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2776.2599999999998s)]
*  Is that too much? You know what let's get hey get it get a couple Capitol Police officers stand behind me because it's so outrageous [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2780.3799999999997s)]
*  I'm furious not everything has to be planned perfect thought out just go fucking do stuff guys [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2785.5s)]
*  and [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2790.9s)]
*  And you know forget it. It's just I do think one of the other very funny things that I just want to bring up [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2791.9s)]
*  Before we go is CNN did a story on this and they talked about how this was all [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2797.7s)]
*  In the and they had this meeting in the Senate Democratic caucus about how to go [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2802.54s)]
*  viral and the media environment all that and this [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2807.78s)]
*  And then story said one of the they called this a bright spots the Democrats highlighted [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2811.2599999999998s)]
*  According to a source familiar was a viral video from the pandemic of Mark Warner making a tuna melt in his kitchen that led to [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2816.7799999999997s)]
*  The lawmaker being cheered and jeered by people who questioned his culinary leanings [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2823.46s)]
*  That was the bright spot. That's the Senate going back going back to 2020 like hey remember when Warner had that viral [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2827.94s)]
*  Tuna video or yes grilled cheese tuna melt it was it was a warm tuna. That's that's where we're at [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2834.2599999999998s)]
*  That's the bright spot the bright spot is hot kitchen tuna when it was just such a badly made tuna sandwich [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2840.1s)]
*  That's why I write wasn't a microwave tuna melt. He did such a bad job making this disgusting people got excited about it [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2844.66s)]
*  So all these questions loom especially large in the in the DNC chair race [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2850.38s)]
*  DNC members will vote for the new chair on Saturday as you all know [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2855.58s)]
*  We hear at the show big Ben Wickler fans [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2859.9s)]
*  And supporters for a long time we've talked about in this pod a million times [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2863.06s)]
*  But we wanted to talk to any of the candidates who wanted to come on I interviewed Ken Martin and Ben [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2866.94s)]
*  Dan interviewed Fazz Shakir on Friday show. I [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2872.98s)]
*  Personally think all three of them would make great DNC chairs, but maybe unsurprisingly [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2877.94s)]
*  We were almost impressed with Ben's vision and his plans and you know [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2883.7400000000002s)]
*  Maybe we're all just hopelessly biased because we have known him and worked with him now since basically we've started this podcast [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2887.6000000000004s)]
*  But even putting that aside, I think [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2893.06s)]
*  Wisconsin was the most Republican leaning blue wall state in 2020 the third most Republican leaning swing state of all in 2020 [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2895.66s)]
*  After Arizona and Georgia everyone was worried about it in 2024 because it's very rural non-college educated state [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2903.54s)]
*  It ended up to the left of the national vote [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2909.04s)]
*  That means that Kamala Harris did worse and the national popular vote than she did in Wisconsin and you know [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2911.62s)]
*  The operation that Ben built was a huge part of that [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2916.7s)]
*  So if we were voting members of the DNC, which they will probably never make us [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2918.9s)]
*  He would get he would get our vote but what do you what do you guys want to add siren pod save America endorse [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2923.56s)]
*  Add the siren and post [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2931.9599999999996s)]
*  Based on our conversation [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2935.16s)]
*  I also just think all three of them had very smart things to say in the conversations that that you had with them on pod save [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2936.2799999999997s)]
*  America in particular. I thought Fazz talking about what it means for [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2941.24s)]
*  the Democratic Party to look [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2946.7599999999998s)]
*  Like it's fighting for people and and it was very smart and like regardless of who's the DNC chair [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2949.1600000000003s)]
*  I think that is really important and kind of goes and it actually fits a lot with what Ben was talking about as well [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2954.2000000000003s)]
*  And what we've been talking about that. It's not just about the right words or the right message. It's about picking the right fights [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2959.32s)]
*  it's about breaking through and figuring how to do that in this messy and noisy environment, but like [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2963.36s)]
*  We talked about a long time that if that that if we could [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2968.4s)]
*  Duplicate Ben Wickler and put him in all 50 states [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2972.84s)]
*  We'd be much better for it [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2975.24s)]
*  And I think we've felt this personally just over the years of going to Wisconsin that Wisconsin was this warning [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2977.56s)]
*  About what could it's omen for what could happen in the country when a group of radicalized Republicans tried to do unpopular things and strip away [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2984.04s)]
*  Democratic accountability for it [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2990.2799999999997s)]
*  And as he said in your interview that they've been kind of on the edge of a cliff this entire time [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2992.3599999999997s)]
*  But what's been exciting having gone to Wisconsin starting when we first did the show all these years later is watching them slowly build [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=2995.7999999999997s)]
*  Operation and figure out how to respond to that kind of a threat and do it in a way that's successful and like there are so [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3001.0s)]
*  Many lessons from what Ben has done in Wisconsin that are valuable nationally. Yeah, we're biased [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3007.2000000000003s)]
*  I met Ben in 2006. So it's like I had nothing against anyone else in the race [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3013.04s)]
*  But I think one thing that we've all noticed about Ben is he has no off switch [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3017.4s)]
*  You're getting texts from him 24 7 365 days a year [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3021.6800000000003s)]
*  About races big and small across Wisconsin and he was able to raise money and awareness and build a state party organization [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3025.64s)]
*  That was always doing work always organizing always building and trying to get power back and they started from a serious deficit in Wisconsin [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3032.7599999999998s)]
*  and that doesn't mean they won every race, but [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3039.72s)]
*  That's not a fair expectation [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3042.64s)]
*  But they didn't sit out any races and I think like that's the kind of mindset you want at the DNC [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3044.3999999999996s)]
*  And it's also just like a vibe and a tenor in its own like Ben [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3049.72s)]
*  We went to lots of events and organizing sessions with him and trainings [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3053.16s)]
*  He's always preaching like an inclusive empowering form of politics that I think would help out the party [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3056.3199999999997s)]
*  And translate well to the DNC and make people want to be a part of the Democratic Party [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3061.9599999999996s)]
*  So I think you'd be great at it. All right. Well, and you know what if you're listening and you're a DNC member and you're gonna be [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3066.08s)]
*  voting and [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3073.04s)]

*  I think it's probably helping this last week to to go public and you know making it probably more helpful than us [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3078.96s)]
*  Because we're not voting. Yeah, and probably has turned off a few people. I [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3084.0s)]
*  Think I think hopefully net positive [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3088.32s)]
*  Positive but if you're out there listening and you and you're thinking the same thing, you know [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3091.04s)]

*  Checkout so the Trump administration has been firing off executive orders left and right many of them seem extremely consequential [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3323.98s)]
*  some are glorified press releases, but many of the more [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3331.06s)]
*  Consequential seeming EOs focus on immigration policy, which is why I am so excited to have a darlind on with me today [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3335.54s)]

*  Yeah, but it's like it's it's certainly the kind of moment that [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3354.42s)]
*  People with my expertise are in demand, I guess [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3358.94s)]
*  Yeah, yeah very much so because it is quite confusing and we're gonna talk through [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3361.7000000000003s)]
*  Some of the complexity and uncertainty of this moment, especially when it comes to immigration. So first question is just big picture [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3366.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean, what do you think are the most important things that Trump has done so far when it comes to immigration policy? [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3373.7799999999997s)]
*  I think that the most salient thing and this is not just the day one executive orders [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3378.9399999999996s)]
*  It's a lot of stuff that has come out since then [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3384.3799999999997s)]
*  In the form of like departmental or agency memos or just in what people are seeing on the ground is a really [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3387.5s)]
*  Aggressive ramp up of interior enforcement against people who have been living in the United States [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3394.8599999999997s)]
*  Many of whom were given some form of protections under the Biden administration [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3400.14s)]
*  we know that the Trump administration is [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3405.8199999999997s)]
*  Has changed regulations so that anyone who is apprehended anywhere in the US who cannot prove to an immigration [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3410.2599999999998s)]
*  Agent's satisfaction that they've been here for more than two years could be deported without a court hearing huge change [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3418.1s)]
*  We know that they are making an effort to [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3424.3399999999997s)]
*  Strip parole protections from people who came under the [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3427.7400000000002s)]
*  Cuban Haitian Nicaraguan and Venezuelan parole programs other Biden parole programs when they encounter them [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3433.3s)]
*  Not that we don't know how broad that's gonna be [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3438.94s)]
*  But those people will be considered vulnerable for deportation and there might be efforts to take people who are in immigration court [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3441.46s)]
*  Close the immigration court case and put them into and try to deport them without a court hearing and we know that they're stepping up [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3448.3s)]
*  The use of you know agents from other agencies whether that's DEA ATF [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3455.94s)]
*  that they're stepping up the use of military assets including planes and so given that most of the [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3461.1s)]
*  Biggest impediments to like deporting 11 million people were not legal but logistical [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3467.2599999999998s)]
*  That kind of force multiplier is could be a very big difference in how many people they're ultimately able to the court [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3473.02s)]
*  I want to ask you about that logistical point because you wrote in this great Times Up Ed after the election [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3479.7799999999997s)]
*  But before inauguration that the largest constraint on mass deportation is [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3485.12s)]
*  Logistical and that deporting 1 million people per year would cost an annual average of 88 billion dollars [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3490.2s)]
*  Can you kind of unpack those logistics for us and explain whether you think there's kind of anything in that insight that opponents of Trump's [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3496.7999999999997s)]
*  Immigration policy could use to fight it sure absolutely [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3505.24s)]
*  So there are essentially four steps that have to be well four major steps that are generally [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3508.16s)]
*  taken but to take somebody who is in the US without authorization and move them to being somebody who's been deported the first is [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3515.12s)]
*  Arresting them the second is finding somewhere to keep them in custody [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3522.12s)]
*  Given that this administration doesn't particularly like releasing people pending, you know, their court hearings are pending for their action [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3526.2s)]
*  There's the court case itself, which you know, they're trying to kind of abridge [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3532.3199999999997s)]
*  By using this expedited removal provision more aggressively [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3539.04s)]
*  But like, you know, so so that's kind of an optional one and then four you have to physically deport them [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3542.48s)]
*  You have to have the seat on the plane and you have to have a country that's willing to accept them [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3547.52s)]
*  So even if you look at what they've done over the last week and say, okay in general [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3550.56s)]
*  They're really trying to get rid of this third stage of the process wherever possible that still leaves arrest detention and deportation [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3556.16s)]
*  So, you know the more agents they have on the ground who are not just ICE agents [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3562.8s)]
*  but other agencies that are being tasked with immigration enforcement and [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3568.0800000000004s)]
*  The more they're able to enlist state and local police to do immigration enforcement the easier the first one gets [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3572.32s)]
*  The more they're able to build temporary facilities [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3578.44s)]
*  Especially using military money under the emergency declaration that was one of the day one executive orders [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3583.0800000000004s)]
*  The easier the second of those is and the more that they can [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3588.68s)]
*  Both use military planes and bully other countries and we saw some of this over the weekend with a you know a [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3592.52s)]
*  Standoff a very brief standoff with the country of Colombia over the use of military flights to deport Colombian nationals [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3600.72s)]
*  The more they can bully other countries to take back military planes or to take back a lot of ice air flights [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3608.24s)]
*  the [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3614.44s)]
*  Easier the deportation part of that is so those are kind of where I'm seeing the big variables right now [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3615.44s)]
*  But ultimately all of those are still resources and even if you're tapping the DOD budget for a lot of things [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3621.96s)]
*  Congress still has to at a certain point [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3629.16s)]
*  You know [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3632.9s)]
*  You're going to either run out of ice budget or Congress is going to have to appropriate in the future the kind of money they [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3634.08s)]
*  Anticipates you're going to be running the Department of Defense that is also engaged in immigration enforcement [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3639.84s)]
*  So while in the short term they're acting really really aggressively [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3644.7999999999997s)]
*  How long they can keep this up is going to depend on whether Congress is writing them a blank check or whether they're going to [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3648.7999999999997s)]
*  Start asking questions about just how much can be spent on it [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3654.64s)]
*  And just your point for I think like we don't have the best relations with Venezuela [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3658.64s)]
*  For example, there are a lot of folks who have left Venezuela over the past decade or so [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3664.2799999999997s)]
*  And made their way north United States what happens if Venezuela just says no American c-17s will never set down in our territory [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3670.52s)]
*  I mean, do we have to get to a point where we're like having to coerce that? [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3677.84s)]
*  Militarily, is that what Trump is threatening here? [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3681.76s)]
*  we're not quite to that point yet because [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3685.28s)]
*  immigration law doesn't technically require you to deport somebody to the country where they came from and this is where the [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3689.36s)]
*  Diplomatic aspect of this gets very complicated and very important [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3698.0s)]
*  In the in the recent past under the Trump and Biden administrations [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3701.96s)]
*  Mexico has agreed to accept some non-mexicans whether that's [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3705.88s)]
*  Temporarily while they await court hearings in the United States under the remain in Mexico program [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3709.52s)]
*  Which the Trump administration is now trying to restart or whether that's actually taking people who are essentially being deported back [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3714.16s)]
*  Deported but deported to Mexico [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3720.96s)]
*  Whether we you know whether and how many people they're willing to accept and that is going to be a very important [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3723.68s)]
*  Variable because it's so much easier to deport people back to Mexico than it is to fly them other places [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3729.44s)]
*  You know, it's just so much cheaper that not only is that going to be and help on the logistical end [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3734.76s)]
*  But also as you mentioned for countries like Venezuela where it's not really [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3740.68s)]
*  Forseeable that you're gonna have some kind of breakthrough where the Maduro government is going to like say yes, this is awesome [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3745.6s)]
*  We love the US now [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3752.0s)]
*  Having other places you can return them to starts to become a really important variable [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3753.74s)]
*  We've already heard rumors that the government of El Salvador is very gung-ho about signing an agreement with the United States [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3758.52s)]
*  That will allow people to be deported to El Salvador who weren't from El Salvador that sort of thing [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3765.24s)]
*  You know the the more options that they have the easier [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3770.6s)]
*  It's going to be for them to get to get around the recalcitrance of any one country [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3774.7s)]
*  Of course bukele is willing to take whatever number of people Trump wants to send to El Salvador [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3778.68s)]
*  that it seems to me that a lot of what's happened so far is [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3785.16s)]
*  PR and for show right? [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3789.64s)]
*  I mean, I think the the Trump administration is talking about [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3791.08s)]
*  The number of deportations over the weekend that may or may not be all that much above kind of the average [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3794.16s)]
*  You might have seen in terms of total deportations under the Biden administration [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3799.72s)]
*  I suspect part of it also is they want to pick fights with like [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3803.68s)]
*  Democrats in liberal cities. I mean what what kind of strategies do you think? [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3808.08s)]
*  You know these progressives can take to push back that doesn't play into this sort of PR effort [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3812.56s)]
*  But actually is impactful for people in communities that are being harmed [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3819.56s)]
*  so I tend to think about this is like a [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3824.12s)]
*  coordinate plane right one axis is [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3827.3199999999997s)]
*  How likely is this to get a lot of headlines to generate a lot of the role that kind of thing? [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3830.3199999999997s)]
*  The other axis is how much does it increase scope? [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3835.2s)]
*  You know how like how much does it make it easier for them to harm to like to put more people into the process? [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3838.8s)]
*  You move people in the process [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3844.56s)]
*  And you're right a lot of the things you know [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3846.08s)]
*  Like things like putting out a press release every single day [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3848.08s)]
*  Can imply that more is being changed than actually is that said? [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3851.2s)]
*  one of the reasons that we're not really seeing movement on the numbers yet is because [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3855.48s)]
*  Some of the authorities they're tapping into haven't really you know scaled like they haven't really been able to [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3858.6s)]
*  Make plans for what does an ICE raid look like when? [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3864.8s)]
*  Everybody's getting put into expedited removal proceedings that sort of thing so I think that you know [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3869.32s)]
*  the big the the biggest reason that picking fights with blue cities is [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3874.88s)]
*  You know it's it's a big PR showdown is because in jurisdictions that don't have a lot of local cooperation with federal law enforcement [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3881.48s)]
*  Where like if they call up the city and say you got to give us the addresses of? [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3889.72s)]
*  Everybody you know who doesn't have legal immigration statuses in cities that have laws requiring that information not to be shared [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3895.0s)]
*  It's a lot harder for them to arrest people to identify [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3901.68s)]
*  Who is removable and take them into custody and so when they have these big raids on? [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3904.72s)]
*  Blue cities in the past what we've seen is the numbers of actual arrestees they get out of them out of them are very low [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3910.2s)]
*  The biggest impact is in terms of freaking people out getting people to not leave their homes to not go to school that sort of thing [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3915.88s)]
*  Which is a real harm um [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3922.1600000000003s)]
*  But it does mean that in kind of holding the line on lack of cooperation [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3924.04s)]
*  And lack of information sharing and certainly not you know [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3929.44s)]
*  Offering like state and local resources to help with immigration enforcement that the amount of [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3935.08s)]
*  Money that's being spent and time that's being spent is going to be greater [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3942.56s)]
*  Proportionally than the number of people who they are getting out of it and can then be arrested and deported [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3948.48s)]
*  Which means that those resources are then being taken from other things right right because a lot of the cooperation you've seen in the past [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3953.3199999999997s)]
*  Has been federal officials going to local state and county jails right and then people up there for deportation [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3959.16s)]
*  One other element of this is Trump is trying to end birthright citizenship [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3966.2799999999997s)]
*  So that would end the practice of giving automatic citizenship to the u.s. Born kids of undocumented [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3969.38s)]
*  Immigrant parents or to the kids of foreign workers or students, so I think it's important to note that that latter category is people here legally [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3975.38s)]
*  When I talk with you know smart lawyers about the birthright citizenship EO [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3984.46s)]
*  They say this is clearly unconstitutional, but if it gets to the Supreme Court like God help us [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3989.3s)]
*  Does that sort of jive with your sense I? [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3995.1400000000003s)]
*  Mean I am I I have a general rule against engaging in Supreme Court punditry because I do think that [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=3998.58s)]
*  to a certain extent the law is whatever the judges say the law is and heaven you know like [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4006.1800000000003s)]
*  heaven forbid they take that they like actually you know seize the reins of that power, but um [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4012.78s)]
*  I do agree that I think that the way that this executive order was done [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4017.94s)]
*  Which is just saying as far as we're concerned [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4023.7599999999998s)]
*  This is not who birthright citizenship applies to and we're not going to be honoring the [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4028.12s)]
*  Citizenship of anyone who was born in the u.s. Under you know to these two parents who like have these particular [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4033.96s)]
*  You know this lack of status or temporary status after February 19th that that is [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4039.7599999999998s)]
*  We've already seen one preliminary ruling against it [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4044.32s)]
*  I would be very surprised if it goes into effect as planned [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4047.6s)]
*  You know like in a few weeks [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4052.68s)]
*  That's not to say that the Supreme Court won't ultimately rule in favor of the administration on this one [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4054.84s)]
*  but like it is worth noting that this is [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4060.68s)]
*  there's a pretty explicit century-old Supreme Court precedent that even if [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4064.24s)]
*  The you know the parents of the child cannot become u.s. Citizens [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4069.32s)]
*  The child is still a citizen of the United States and so they would be [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4074.8999999999996s)]
*  there it's not really a [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4080.4199999999996s)]
*  Reasonable people have disagreed on this for decades kind of situation [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4083.8599999999997s)]
*  it's it is an effort to innovate the law in a particular direction and so there's [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4087.46s)]
*  Reason to believe that the Supreme Court is going to be a little more skeptical of this than they would be of other Trump administration [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4095.22s)]
*  Yeah, I mean you mentioned there was this one ruling already from a judge who I believe was a Reagan appointee [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4101.9s)]
*  He said I've been on the bench for over four decades [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4106.46s)]
*  I can't remember another case where the question presented is as clear as this one. This is a blatantly unconstitutional order [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4108.82s)]
*  yeah, he was steamed and you know, the other thing about that case is the [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4115.1s)]
*  plaintiffs were [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4120.5s)]
*  Extremely ready to file a complaint and the administration despite the fact that it was you know [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4122.1s)]
*  That it was their government filed all of three pages and replied that were basically na-ah [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4127.12s)]
*  So like they're not doing at least so far [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4132.92s)]
*  They're not doing a tremendously robust job of if they truly believe this is what the law says [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4136.0199999999995s)]
*  They're not doing the most aggressive like the best job of showing up in court and saying got it got it [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4141.0s)]
*  Congress is also getting in on the act here [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4148.0s)]
*  So they just passed a piece of legislation called the Lake and Riley Act [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4150.099999999999s)]
*  Pass on a bipartisan basis the bill got 64 yes votes in the Senate [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4153.719999999999s)]
*  263 yes votes in the house including 46 Democrats in the house [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4158.04s)]
*  Um, can you give us just like a quick overview of what the Lake and Riley Act does? Sure. So there are two [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4160.96s)]
*  totally fairly separate parts of [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4166.92s)]
*  the the law that are one of which is is kind of it is it expands immigration enforcement in a way that's [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4170.12s)]
*  That Congress often acts to expand immigration enforcement and one of which is totally unprecedented [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4177.48s)]
*  Could be very good unfold in very unpredictable ways [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4182.32s)]
*  The first is that it the Lake and Riley Act requires that the federal government [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4186.08s)]
*  expeditiously take into custody anybody who is arrested or charged with or convicted of a certain certain set of crimes including theft charges now that [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4192.2s)]
*  By saying you can't you don't have to be convicted. You can just be like accused essentially certainly does raise due process concerns [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4202.0s)]
*  There are also prioritization concerns [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4209.4s)]
*  like if you're saying that somebody that that there's somebody in custody in rural, Georgia and [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4211.32s)]
*  You have to get in your patrol car and go immediately to go get that person [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4217.679999999999s)]
*  There are other enforcement actions you could be engaging in but the other part of Lake and Riley says that [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4222.639999999999s)]
*  states can sue the federal government to force the federal government to [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4228.0s)]
*  You know to deport somebody who they've chosen not to execute a final order of deportation against to detain somebody or to stop [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4233.76s)]
*  visas for a category of visa or a country [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4241.64s)]
*  If they if the country is if they believe the country is being recalcitrant in accepting deportees [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4244.68s)]
*  So because that there is on the books, you know [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4250.64s)]
*  The federal government has the power to take sanctions and so if the federal government isn't taking these sanctions like [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4253.320000000001s)]
*  The thing we're all thinking about is okay, so what is stopping Ken Paxton from [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4259.04s)]
*  suing, you know the federal government to force it to [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4264.08s)]
*  Stop issuing h1b visas to China because China doesn't take every deportation as many quite as many deportees as the US might like [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4267.36s)]
*  there that that's kind of a it's a real wild card and [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4275.28s)]
*  We don't know how it's going to play out yet [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4280.0s)]
*  But it certainly adds an interesting wrinkle to the dispute that we know is going on within the Trump administration [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4283.24s)]
*  Over h1b and high-skill visas generally because if the Trump administration goes in a more dovish direction [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4288.8s)]
*  Than say the Bannon wing would like they now have this legal tool that they can use to try to stop them [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4295.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, just to dig in on those two sort of pieces [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4301.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean look, I'm not a lawyer [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4304.08s)]
*  But I thought that undocumented people had due process rights under the fifth and the 14th amendment [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4305.76s)]
*  This bill says if you're just accused of basically petty shoplifting you can be deported [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4310.759999999999s)]
*  I mean that that does not seem like due process to me. Am I wrong? [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4317.0s)]
*  The fundamental thing you have to remember about immigration law is that deportation is not a criminal penalty [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4320.5599999999995s)]
*  It is a civil penalty and it's one you incur [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4325.16s)]
*  Potentially simply by being in the US without authorization [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4328.639999999999s)]
*  You don't have to have committed any other any crime or anything else in order to be deportable [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4331.44s)]
*  So what this does is say this person's already deportable by getting arrested they're now an enforcement priority [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4336.599999999999s)]
*  Which is not something that you really have a due process claim against now if you're not in fact [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4344.2s)]
*  Removable you can try to get yourself out of ice custody [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4349.719999999999s)]
*  and yes, of course there are due process concerns in like in the sense of you are treat you're saying this person's a priority because [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4352.599999999999s)]
*  You're classifying them as a criminal [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4360.48s)]
*  They're not you know that that but they're not concerns that are legally actionable [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4362.5599999999995s)]
*  That's terrible part two [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4370.16s)]
*  I mean [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4371.639999999999s)]
*  So like the Attorney General in Oklahoma can tell Marco Rubio the Secretary of State that he's no longer allowed to issue [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4372.44s)]
*  Visas to a random country because I don't know it helps this Attorney General in Oklahoma [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4379.839999999999s)]
*  Politically to demand that the federal government even the Trump government be tougher on immigrants that that seems completely unworkable [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4385.16s)]
*  It absolutely could be unworkable, you know, I think that the I [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4391.24s)]
*  This was originally part of the bill when it was introduced under the last Congress [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4399.08s)]
*  Which is to say under the Biden administration, which might go some way in indicating why it was added to the bill to begin with I [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4403.76s)]
*  Think that the assumption to a certain extent is that you know [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4410.8s)]
*  State AG's are going to not necessarily want to embarrass members of their own party [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4415.42s)]
*  but I think the other part of the assumption is that [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4420.46s)]
*  Judges are not necessarily going to be super eager to weigh in on this stuff [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4423.74s)]
*  That that the a you know that judges tend to have a pretty narrow [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4428.22s)]
*  Construal of like this sort of their ability to weigh in on this sort of thing [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4433.900000000001s)]
*  And so that that would you know [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4440.1s)]
*  I think that there's a certain kind of adults in the room understanding that this that that would prevent it from being entire to [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4442.42s)]
*  Entirely disruptive. I don't know that that's merited, but I think we'll see what combination of kind of political pressures and [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4448.0199999999995s)]
*  you know just and and [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4455.78s)]
*  Judicial professional pressures exist to check this [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4457.94s)]
*  You're good to liberal attorney generals in blue states just suing the State Department over nothing for fun [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4461.14s)]
*  I just thought that I said the bill would cost 26 billion to implement in the first year [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4466.74s)]
*  So back to your resourcing and logistics question, it seems wildly difficult to do this without I guess an appropriation of new money [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4471.3s)]
*  Well, so the way that usually ice has operated over the last several years is they keep spending the money [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4479.62s)]
*  Which is usually faster than their budgeted to spend it and then they write Congress letters of increasing alarm of tone [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4486.34s)]
*  Saying if you don't give us more money before the end of the fiscal year in a supplemental [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4494.02s)]
*  We're gonna have to start releasing criminals, right? And usually congress says fine. Fine. Here's the money you asked for in the supplemental [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4498.82s)]
*  Okay, so you mentioned also, you know the temporary protected status [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4505.54s)]
*  On the way out the door president biden granted an extension of temporary protected status or tps [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4508.74s)]
*  To nearly a million immigrants from venezuela el salvador ukraine and sudan which should protect them [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4514.82s)]
*  From deportation through I think the fall of 2026 [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4521.379999999999s)]
*  I know the trump administration is not a big fan of tps or lots of you know pathways of legal immigration [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4524.5s)]
*  Can they just rescind that extension or like what do you think happens to tps? [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4530.9s)]
*  This is where we get into some [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4535.62s)]
*  Really uncharted territory both legally and policy wise because the trump administration said in one of its executive orders that it is going to review [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4538.259999999999s)]
*  grants of tps given under biden [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4546.66s)]
*  So [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4550.26s)]
*  We don't know whether that means they're going to say that some of these, you know 11th hour tps grants [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4551.14s)]
*  Shouldn't have been issued to begin with and try to argue that they shouldn't be forced to honor them or not [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4558.02s)]
*  That's something that's not clear. We don't know what happens to people who have applications for tps [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4563.46s)]
*  Who you know if you if you were paroled in under I think chnv cuban haitian nicaragua venezuelan parole program [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4569.54s)]
*  But you were here as a venezuelan when the venezuela tps extension was issued and you've applied [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4577.299999999999s)]
*  What is that? You know can can you be removed once your parole expires even though you have this pending application? [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4583.38s)]
*  Are they going to try to do that? [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4589.86s)]
*  there are so many open questions about this and it's [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4592.0199999999995s)]
*  really [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4595.62s)]
*  It's concerning because frankly a lot of these are folks who are not the most tapped in to [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4597.38s)]
*  You know [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4603.299999999999s)]
*  They're like to high information news sources anyway, and so [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4604.58s)]
*  the uncertainty that they're facing and the potential legal complexity of what they're facing is really [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4609.3s)]
*  difficult to predict but we really we absolutely could be seeing a pretty aggressive clob at front on tps and [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4615.3s)]
*  You know [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4622.98s)]
*  It's just going to depend on what they decide to announce from here and how much effort they're willing to spend on the us cis side [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4623.78s)]
*  And sending, you know individualized no, thank you. You don't have status anymore notifications and defending it in court [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4630.66s)]
*  Man, I mean I just just to underscore how cruel it would be to start sending people back to sudan [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4638.82s)]
*  Which has been in the middle of the horrific civil war for well over a year now [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4644.34s)]
*  There's accusations of genocide against the rebel forces and even some of the the sudanese armed forces [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4649.78s)]
*  I think half the country is is at risk of starvation [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4656.0199999999995s)]
*  Um millions of people being displaced [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4659.8s)]
*  I mean the idea that you would just put someone on a plane back to cartoon right now is is just like unthinkable from a moral level [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4661.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, and this is I mean it's worth underscoring even though we've been discussing it that there is a difference between saying that somebody is [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4669.08s)]
*  Legally vulnerable to deportation and actually taking the effort to deprive them and with tps [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4674.58s)]
*  you know it is [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4680.84s)]
*  there [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4682.84s)]
*  There is a certain extent to which the trump administration has made it pretty clear that [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4683.8s)]
*  People who arrived under biden are in their crosshairs [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4687.48s)]
*  But in general [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4691.48s)]
*  It is not necessarily true that somebody who had legal status and is going to have it sunset [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4693.24s)]
*  Is going to become a target but even just putting them in that pool [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4699.639999999999s)]
*  Puts them more at risk and it also makes it harder for them to plan their lives with tps in particular because so many of these people [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4703.639999999999s)]
*  Have had you know, so many of these countries have had tps for [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4710.679999999999s)]
*  years and decades [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4714.12s)]
*  These are people who have been making their lives in 18 to 24 month increments to begin with [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4715.88s)]
*  And now you're giving even that assurance away from them. So it's a fairly [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4720.28s)]
*  Profound change for the circumstances in which these people are living. Yeah, absolutely. Um [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4724.900000000001s)]
*  Do you think is it now kind of all about enforcement and you know the kind of memos to agencies about [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4730.4400000000005s)]
*  How to implement these policies are you expecting more executive orders and major policy changes? We just don't know we we absolutely do not know [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4737.16s)]
*  um [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4745.16s)]
*  When russ vote got caught on a hot mic last year. Well, it wasn't a hot mic [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4746.84s)]
*  It was it was it was essentially a sting operation [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4751.72s)]
*  Um the the now again head of omb who was running project 2025 [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4754.2s)]
*  He said that you know [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4758.84s)]
*  There were a lot of things that they were working on that were very close hold that they weren't putting in project 2025 a lot of [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4760.92s)]
*  memos [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4766.9s)]
*  Uh and policy guidance that they were pre-drafting and so we just don't know what the volume of those is [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4768.04s)]
*  We've continued to see things going out that [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4774.2s)]
*  Almost certainly were developed before inauguration because it would just be a tremendous amount of effort to get them done [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4777.72s)]
*  You know before that [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4785.400000000001s)]
*  um or after that but we don't know how much there is and it is [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4786.76s)]
*  You know, there there are some things in the executive orders that kind of hint at future action [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4791.88s)]
*  There is for example one executive order that says that within 90 days [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4797.16s)]
*  Um, there should be a review of whether the insurrection act is necessary to invoke [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4801.5599999999995s)]
*  So that is something that they've actually flagged could be coming [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4805.16s)]
*  But for the most part the mo of this administration [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4808.2s)]
*  Is and was during the you know [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4811.72s)]
*  The end of the first term to find places in federal law that can be used to [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4814.04s)]
*  Ramp up immigration enforcement that have kind of lain dormant for decades [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4819.5599999999995s)]
*  So we don't know how many of those other places they've found [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4823.32s)]
*  The one thing I just haven't heard much about is any kind of increased penalties or scrutiny of employers [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4826.2s)]
*  Um versus individuals. I mean for a long time [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4831.96s)]
*  That was kind of [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4835.96s)]
*  The approach of a lot of immigration policy, right? [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4837.4s)]
*  Which is to make it really hard for people to work by punishing their employers if they hired undocumented people [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4839.56s)]
*  But i'm just I don't feel like i'm hearing much about that [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4844.52s)]
*  the primary way that they [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4847.16s)]
*  Would be going about this would be just engaging in enforcement [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4850.44s)]
*  Usually when there are large scale workplace raids those are associated with some form of [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4854.68s)]
*  You know [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4861.08s)]
*  Prosecution or sanction or something against the employer who they're raiding. Um [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4862.2s)]
*  that is you know, that's that's a [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4867.5599999999995s)]
*  Kind of stochastic thing, right? You're not like you're not auditing an entire sector [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4870.599999999999s)]
*  And so the extent to which it's going to really shape employer behavior is unclear [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4876.04s)]
*  But yeah the [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4880.4400000000005s)]
*  The biggest tool the biggest thing that kind of hasn't been done on employer sanctions is legislative [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4881.96s)]
*  it's mandatory nationwide verify and [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4886.92s)]
*  That has not been as much of a priority of this generation of immigration restrictionism as it was like a decade ago [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4890.36s)]
*  in part because [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4897.0s)]
*  There are employers who would who are willing to stay quiet even as [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4898.52s)]
*  It becomes harder for them to hire people legally [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4904.12s)]
*  Um, but if you try to go after their workforce then or if you try to prevent them from hiring anyone who doesn't have [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4907.400000000001s)]
*  Authorization then they'll get mad at you. Um, so, you know, I think it's it's still to be seen. It's certainly not a [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4912.9800000000005s)]
*  It's it's not a rhetorical priority for them unless you start talking about the economic benefits of [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4920.2s)]
*  Immigration in which case they start talking about how exploitative employers are [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4926.9800000000005s)]
*  But there hasn't been a whole lot of effort to make it, you know, for example department of labor priority to go after employers [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4930.52s)]
*  For exploiting unauthorized labor got it. I mean just finally on the politics [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4936.84s)]
*  I mean curious how you think or why you think the politics on immigration policy changed so much over [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4940.4400000000005s)]
*  I don't know. Let's say the past decade or so. I don't know if it was just generally more [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4947.16s)]
*  Migration biden's policies like the relentless busing from states like texas to blue states [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4952.18s)]
*  I mean, what's your big picture sense of that? I think that [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4958.68s)]
*  you know [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4963.16s)]
*  For one thing their thermostatic effect, you know like [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4964.76s)]
*  A public opinion swinging in favor of immigrants under trump and then swinging against under biden is really really hard to [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4968.76s)]
*  It's hard to overstate and it's also hard to disentangle anything else from that kind of basic [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4975.88s)]
*  Oh, the government is doing some things [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4981.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't like i'm going to make this more salient in general immigration isn't salient for a whole lot of people and so [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4983.56s)]
*  They're very [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4990.04s)]
*  It's very easy to kind of swing them from one direction to the other based on opposition to who's in office based on [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4991.160000000001s)]
*  You know seeing b-roll of people coming in that sort of thing [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=4998.52s)]
*  I don't think that I think it's I think it's kind of [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=5003.0s)]
*  not [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=5007.08s)]
*  Clear whether what we're seeing is a an increase in the number of people who are really really activated against unauthorized immigration or against immigration [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=5008.360000000001s)]
*  Generally or whether what we're seeing is the culmination of the fact that this is because that this is the signature policy issue of the man [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=5016.68s)]
*  Who's been the standard bearer of the republican party for a decade? [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=5024.280000000001s)]
*  And so anyone who's affiliated with the republican party has decided that this is a more important issue to them [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=5027.0s)]
*  But you know, I think the other side of this is a lot of people who were in solidly blue jurisdictions [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=5032.12s)]
*  saw strains on state and local governments responding to recent arrivals and so [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=5039.0s)]
*  We're forced or you know, I think I think we're like [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=5044.44s)]
*  put in a space where they were considering that actually there was a certain amount of zero sum trade-off between [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=5047.64s)]
*  Investing in people who are already here and investing in new arrivals and the the viden administration by kind of [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=5052.66s)]
*  Not doing a whole lot to ensure that new arrivals were coming in an undestructive way didn't necessarily help with this [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=5059.64s)]
*  um, but that that you know, whether that was [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=5067.96s)]
*  Something that's going to like really change a whole lot of people's opinions permanently or whether it was a reaction to [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=5071.8s)]
*  A moment under an administration that is no longer in office is something that remains to be seen. Yeah, very good point [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=5077.08s)]
*  Um, well darah, thank you so much for for coming on the show final final question [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=5082.84s)]
*  Uh, you got the band back together with your old crew from the weeds with ezra klein and matthew glacius the other day on ezra's podcast [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=5086.6s)]
*  Is there any chance of a comeback tour where you hit a few kind of the nerdiest cities? [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=5093.4s)]
*  You know, we could sell out some stadiums [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoH_7UtKazg&t=5097.88s)]
