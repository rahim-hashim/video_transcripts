Video Description: Right-wing influencers and conspiracy theorists lose it over a Justice Department memo that says there's no evidence Jeffrey Epstein had a "client list" or blackmailed his associates. Criticism of DOGE's cuts to the National Weather Service resurface after catastrophic floods hit central Texas. In a Fourth of July ceremony, President Trump signs his disastrous economic plan into law. Jon and Tommy break down the Medicaid cuts, ICE funding, and the highly unusual tax breaks that made it into the final "Big Beautiful Bill." Then they check in on Elon Musk's growing threat to launch a new political party, and they discuss Kilmar Abrego Garcia's allegation that he was tortured in El Salvador's CECOT megaprison.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# MAGA In REVOLT After Trump Breaks Key Promises
**Pod Save America:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0)
*  I think the really gross stuff was I saw some people be like well Texas you voted for Trump and this is what you get [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, we're Americans. We're all Americans. Don't do that. Welcome to Pod save America. I'm John Favreau [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=6.140000000000001s)]
*  I'm Tommy Vitor love it is off this week. So [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  Because we're gonna do our best to fill the 30 or 40 minutes of insight we typically get from him [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=14.56s)]
*  Wow, okay [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=23.34s)]
*  Really you didn't like his joke about your your Twitter habits when you're on vacation [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=25.58s)]
*  Look, it was a big piece of legislation was is a big beautiful and my tweets did not matter [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=29.38s)]
*  As we as we found out at all. They did nothing [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=34.78s)]
*  Fortunately, we do have a lot to cover today [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=39.54s)]
*  We're gonna talk about what's next for Trump's big bill now that it's a big law [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=41.94s)]
*  Talk about ice becoming bigger than most countries militaries as part of the bill [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=47.9s)]
*  Elon Musk's new America party can't wait to join launched on around July 4th weekend. It's like the Innovation Party is [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=52.54s)]
*  Do you cut wondering who would make the Innovation Party joke first? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=60.7s)]
*  It was you and Magelworld turning on Trump over the latest Jeffrey Epstein revelations or lack thereof [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=63.620000000000005s)]
*  I guess so what we will dig into that as well [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=69.26s)]
*  We do want to start with the horrific floods that hit Kerr County, Texas over the weekend [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=72.82000000000001s)]
*  Which is a county just northwest of San Antonio as of late Monday afternoon at least 89 people have died [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=78.42s)]
*  including 27 campers and staff from Camp Mystic [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=86.06s)]
*  Which is an all-girl summer camp that was essentially washed away by the floods [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=89.74s)]
*  Many more people are missing as of right now [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=94.97999999999999s)]
*  It has been absolutely just gut-wrenching. Yeah to see photos of these eight and nine year old girls [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=98.46s)]
*  Who died to hear their parents talk about them to hear from the parents who are like just still [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=106.86000000000001s)]
*  At this moment looking for their kids. It's just an unimaginable tragedy. It is [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=113.74000000000001s)]
*  This is now one of the deadliest floods of the last century [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=119.74000000000001s)]
*  And this area of Texas is in particular is is one of the most dangerous regions in the country for floods [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=123.42000000000002s)]
*  So naturally there have been plenty of questions about whether anything could have been done to get people out of harm's way earlier [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=129.74s)]
*  the Trump administration is getting criticism for the doge cuts to the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=136.46s)]
*  National Weather Service the NWS where 10% of the staff has been fired including [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=140.70000000000002s)]
*  Meteorologists and two of the offices that now have vacancies are in the area of the flood [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=146.58s)]
*  The NWS has also had to delay weather balloon launches across the country and those help forecast storms [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=152.46s)]
*  All that said the National Weather Service did issue timely warnings about this flood [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=159.3s)]
*  The problem was that those warnings didn't get to the people who were in danger [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=164.3s)]
*  This is known as the last mile problem [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=168.38s)]
*  Apparently, Kirk County opted against investing in a flood warning system back in 2017 because they thought it was too expensive [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=171.38s)]
*  So Trump responded to some of the criticism over the weekend when he took questions from reporters at his golf club in New Jersey [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=179.66s)]
*  Here he is accompanied by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=186.14000000000001s)]
*  See that the National Weather Service or the emergency [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=194.06s)]
*  They did not they did I'll tell you [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=197.66s)]
*  You look at that that what a situation that all is and that was really the Biden set up [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=201.14000000000001s)]
*  That was not our setup, but I wouldn't blame Biden for it either. I would [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=207.14000000000001s)]
*  just say this is a hundred year catastrophe and [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=211.9s)]
*  It's just so horrible to watch [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=216.3s)]
*  In light of the floods, do you think that the federal government needs to hire back any of the meteorologists who were fired in the last few months? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=218.3s)]
*  I would know that I really would I would think not [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=226.70000000000002s)]
*  Are you still planning to phase out FEMA? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=229.42000000000002s)]
*  Well FEMA is [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=232.94s)]
*  Something we can talk about later [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=235.3s)]
*  But right now they're busy working. What the fuck is the water situation? The water setup? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=237.5s)]
*  I [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=243.42s)]
*  Could blame Biden, but I won't blame Biden, but I just did blame Biden for the water setup. I just I've I've found the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=245.26s)]
*  political fighting over this pretty tough to stomach or really engage with like it's just it you know, you watch these interviews with [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=252.06s)]
*  some dad combing through like this rubble trying to find his kids and it's just like sort of all you can think about [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=258.98s)]
*  It does sound like what you said was right like the last mile problem getting the warnings to people who are [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=265.78s)]
*  In rural areas no cell service in the middle of the night like that does sound like that was the broader problem than [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=270.98s)]
*  predicting the flood but I thought the letters in or the questions in Chuck Schumer's letter were [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=276.62s)]
*  Appropriate and important like we should say that on Monday morning Chuck Schumer sent a letter to the inspector general at the Commerce Department [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=282.09999999999997s)]
*  Demanding an investigation. So that's the that's the letter. Yeah, like I think we need to know [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=288.78s)]
*  Basically if cuts to the National Weather Service [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=294.09999999999997s)]
*  Slow down things or put people at risk, I think that's an important question going forward [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=296.3s)]
*  I could have done without the like instant, you know leap to blame name your political opponent for this tragedy on Twitter [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=300.38s)]
*  I think that's just gross. Yeah, I mean I think well [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=307.52000000000004s)]
*  So I think the really gross stuff was I saw some people be like well, Texas you voted for Trump [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=311.26000000000005s)]
*  And this is what you get. You know, we're Americans. We're all Americans. Don't do that shit [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=316.70000000000005s)]
*  I think that two things can be true the doge cuts to the National Weather Service in this case had [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=320.6s)]
*  nothing to do with [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=328.28000000000003s)]
*  The tragedy, you know, it seems like the National Weather Service [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=330.32s)]
*  like I said did send out a timely warning it just didn't get to people and [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=333.56s)]
*  That's you know, not the Trump administration saying that that's [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=337.88s)]
*  Independent meteorologists and experts. You all have all said this [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=341.6s)]
*  but it is it is true that [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=345.32s)]
*  We are now facing worsening climate [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=347.64s)]
*  Disasters, that's just a fact whether or not you believe in climate change. It's still a fact [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=352.04s)]
*  You can you can look at the record. It's like recorded now, which is like the [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=356.08s)]
*  hurricanes floods droughts [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=360.36s)]
*  You name it. They've been they've been more frequent and more intense over the last couple decades [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=363.56s)]
*  And so now, you know, we need to figure out what to do about that [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=367.8s)]
*  And there's two things you can do about it aside from [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=372.71999999999997s)]
*  But in the immediate you can figure out how to prepare for these disasters and you can figure out how to respond to them on the preparation side [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=374.72s)]
*  You know you cut [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=381.72s)]
*  10% of the national weather staff much of meteorologists were not pretty then you have meteorologist way before this hit [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=383.72s)]
*  Saying like we're about to head into a hurricane season where we can't predict storms as well [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=390.52000000000004s)]
*  And we're all flying blind here. Yes, it's like really bad [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=395.20000000000005s)]
*  So it's a really bad thing to do because it's a really bad thing to do [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=398.40000000000003s)]
*  So it's horrible that they made those cuts and then on the other end, you know [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=403.35999999999996s)]
*  Trump had been talking about getting rid of FEMA [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=408.59999999999997s)]
*  They installed they installed a director at FEMA who told the FEMA staff when he got there that he wasn't aware [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=410.08s)]
*  That we had a hurricane season that seems bad [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=416.79999999999995s)]
*  Also, we probably should have thought twice about shooting down that Chinese balloon could have used that thing [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=419.44s)]
*  That's right [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=423.67999999999995s)]
*  You know what I'm saying now back in February the Trump administration fired hundreds of few employees and they offered buyouts to [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=424.12s)]
*  Hundreds more maybe thousands more. So yeah, they're definitely gutting FEMA [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=429.92s)]
*  They also rescinded grants that are designed to help communities prepare for climate disasters, which seems like a very bad idea [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=433.12s)]
*  They disbanded all these FEMA advisory councils made up of actual professionals who understand disaster relief and then they put in place [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=439.72s)]
*  New politicized entities in their stead and to your point yet [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=445.88s)]
*  Trump now wants to get rid of FEMA after hurricane season [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=449.98s)]
*  He says, you know, you'll disperse those responsibilities to the states, but I have no confidence that'll happen [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=452.36s)]
*  It's just don't have the same money the same resources to do and they have finite resources [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=457.4s)]
*  So, you know, they're gonna put it to the things that are most acute political need for whoever that leader is and then that great [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=461.44s)]
*  The big big picture stuff is we're pulling out of Paris climate accords [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=466.35999999999996s)]
*  We are gutting tax credits for renewable energy in this big beautiful bill [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=469.91999999999996s)]
*  Where Trump's doing everything he can to prioritize oil and gas and coal which will exacerbate climate change and there's just [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=474.12s)]
*  Republicans seem can't seem to agree on the fact that this is [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=480.88s)]
*  exacerbating [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=484.44s)]
*  Climate disasters in their communities as well and it's just [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=485.68s)]
*  It's hard because when Doge was doing what Doge did [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=489.76s)]
*  You know, they were almost too many cuts too many stories too many horrors to focus on any one of them [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=495.72s)]
*  but I remember the National Weather Service cuts I remember thinking that was crazy it seemed crazy and [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=500.8s)]
*  We didn't really talk much about it at the time and there was a bunch of like meteorologists [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=506.04s)]
*  Who are usually not partisan types like local meteorologists some of them on? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=510.28000000000003s)]
*  During their broadcasts being like hey, by the way, usually I can tell you there's this guy in Florida [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=515.4399999999999s)]
*  He's like usually I can tell you when the when the hurricane is gonna turn if it's gonna turn [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=519.92s)]
*  I actually can't tell you now [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=523.88s)]
*  We don't know and so again like we you don't want to talk about it [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=525.0s)]
*  You know in the midst of tragedy, especially if it doesn't directly have to do with the tragedy [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=529.12s)]
*  But a couple weeks from now are people who's gonna be talking about the National Weather Service cuts [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=533.62s)]
*  I know it's hard because you don't want to be like Trump. You don't want to be the guy who was literally [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=538.16s)]
*  Attacking California elected officials for the LA fires while they were still burning or like that that is disgusting [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=543.8s)]
*  You know, you don't want to be like him and claiming that you know [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=550.48s)]
*  He turned some valve in Northern California and thus saved all of us by allowing the water to flow down, right? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=553.92s)]
*  but it is beyond frustrating that [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=560.3s)]
*  The fires extreme weather events all of this is gonna get worse because of Trump's climate policies and yet [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=563.52s)]
*  We can't seem to get people to tie the last two together [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=569.1999999999999s)]
*  I guess we just have to keep making the case and on the micro level [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=572.24s)]
*  You know [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=577.16s)]
*  There's the 2017 Kerr County first [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=578.62s)]
*  You know thought about and then ultimately rejected this like warning system, right? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=582.0s)]
*  And part of that was because a couple years earlier there had been a flood a deadly flood too. And there's a county next door [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=587.64s)]
*  That actually did have this system in place and this is a kind of system where you know right now you can get alerts on your [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=595.24s)]
*  Phone, but if you are out of cell phone range or it's the middle of the night like it was here phone off [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=601.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you're your phone offer. You're gonna see like oh flash flood alert, you know [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=605.48s)]
*  But they have things like they can have sirens like they do for tornadoes [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=608.8s)]
*  They have these systems they can do and this county right is you know [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=612.4399999999999s)]
*  It's probably like I don't think taxpayers want to do that because you know, no one especially [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=616.56s)]
*  Sometimes in red states and red state officials like they don't want to pay for the things that you have to pay for because [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=621.92s)]
*  Governments always inefficient government stupid [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=626.62s)]
*  But like you know what when we're gonna be facing many more climate disasters and they're gonna become more extreme [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=628.6s)]
*  They're gonna become more frequent like yeah, I think it's like time to make a case that [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=634.4399999999999s)]
*  Investing in government preparedness and response is really fucking important. Yeah, definitely. It's a tragedy [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=639.4s)]
*  all right, let's talk about Donald Trump's economic plan, which the Republican Congress passed and [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=645.6s)]
*  President signed into law at a 4th of July ceremony at the White House [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=651.56s)]
*  It obviously included a b2 bomber flyover. The next big fight now will be overselling the wildly unpopular law to a [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=654.6s)]
*  very skeptical public and it appears that the administration's primary strategy is to [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=661.9599999999999s)]
*  Just keep lying about what the law does who it harms Scott Besson was out on the Sunday shows [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=667.1999999999999s)]
*  Pedaling the bullshit that the only people affected by the trillion dollar cut to Medicaid [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=673.0799999999999s)]
*  Will be able-bodied adults who choose not to work despite the fact that only 8% [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=679.24s)]
*  8% of Medicaid recipients fit this description. Here's a clip of Besson putting a work requirement is [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=684.36s)]
*  By definition it changed to benefits. No, there are no change in benefits [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=690.9200000000001s)]
*  There's a change in requirements to get the benefits the able-bodied Americans are not vulnerable Americans [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=695.28s)]
*  People can get off Medicaid and get a job that has good health care benefits [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=702.0400000000001s)]
*  It is a group of Democrats who unfortunately seem to think that poor people are stupid [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=707.08s)]
*  I don't think poor people are stupid. I think they have agency [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=712.8s)]
*  To be fair, I think he thinks we're all stupid. I think he does too. He is really [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=717.3199999999999s)]
*  Dishonest what and not a very good messenger. No, I don't think I've really heard him talk that much. He was terrible there [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=722.24s)]
*  I mean [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=727.16s)]
*  The truth is experts think 17 million people are gonna lose their health insurance because of this bill [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=728.0s)]
*  Most of that is because they're gonna use red tape and bureaucracy to undo a lot of the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=732.8000000000001s)]
*  basically provisions that allowed the working poor to get Medicaid and [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=739.8000000000001s)]
*  They're just gonna do it through red tape because they know that if you're on Medicaid and you're trying to cobble together a bunch of [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=743.64s)]
*  Part-time jobs to pay the bills. It's gonna be difficult to prove that you worked 80 hours that month [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=748.16s)]
*  They're volunteered for 80 hours [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=752.5600000000001s)]
*  they also know most Medicaid recipients already working when you mentioned the [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=754.0400000000001s)]
*  92% stat the way that breaks down is two-thirds of adults age 19 to 64 on Medicaid are working [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=757.78s)]
*  This is according to a Kaiser Family Foundation study and then nearly three and ten [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=764.02s)]
*  We're not working because their caregivers are sick or have disabilities or attending school and otherwise they qualify for exemptions. So that means [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=767.78s)]
*  How we're gonna ring this much savings out of 8% of the expansion population [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=775.14s)]
*  No, what's gonna happen is what's happened in Arkansas when they put in place a policy like this where? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=779.8199999999999s)]
*  18,000 people lost coverage because of work requirements and there was no increase in employment because those people are already working [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=785.9s)]
*  They just got pushed out of the system because they couldn't do the bureaucracy. Yeah, I just [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=792.82s)]
*  First time I caught this in that clip is Scott Besson being like I think people can get off Medicaid and get a job [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=798.4200000000001s)]
*  There's been this you hear it from best from Trump people MAGA people that they're like everyone's sitting home collecting Medicaid benefits [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=804.58s)]
*  That's not how Medicaid works so you don't get a check it's not benefits you go to the hospital you have health insurance [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=812.5s)]
*  You go see a doctor you have health insurance and just like people who don't have Medicaid have health insurance [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=818.54s)]
*  When it gets paid for when you go to the doctor, right or sometimes you have to you know [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=823.3s)]
*  I have a copay which by the way copays are gonna be [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=827.8399999999999s)]
*  Raised as part of this as well [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=830.5s)]
*  So it's not just the work requirements [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=832.42s)]
*  But like this idea that people are just sitting there collecting Medicaid benefits is not it's just fucking ludicrous makes no sense [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=833.78s)]
*  Only apparently only 31% of the cuts this Steve Ratner had a piece about this in the New York Times [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=840.92s)]
*  Only 31% of the cuts to Medicaid are due to the work requirements [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=846.16s)]
*  So even if even as unfair as it is that you just mentioned that all the work requirements and how onerous they are and how [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=850.52s)]
*  They're gonna result in a lot of people losing it. That's still only 31% of the trillion dollar cut there [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=855.76s)]
*  So the rest of it is just Medicaid cuts that have nothing to do with work requirements [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=860.7199999999999s)]
*  Annie Lowry had a great piece about this in the Atlantic [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=864.8s)]
*  And she made the point that other people have made which is this is not really a work requirement [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=868.6s)]
*  It's a work reporting requirement exactly and it's the reporting. That's the bullshit. That's the hard part you think to yourself [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=872.68s)]
*  Okay. Well if you're working [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=878.52s)]
*  Shouldn't you just don't you just check a box and say I'm working and that's it's like no [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=880.88s)]
*  No, you have to like create an ID and a login and then upload verification [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=884.92s)]
*  Documents and you have to collect the documents and if you miss a call from a caseworker you lose your health care and like [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=890.16s)]
*  This is how this works [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=895.4s)]
*  The other state you mentioned Arkansas that has these requirements is is Georgia has this [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=897.12s)]
*  Georgia pays the states also by the way have to now set up and pay for these verification systems for Medicaid, right? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=903.0s)]
*  So Georgia pays nine dollars in overhead for every one dollar [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=909.72s)]
*  It spends on care for its Medicaid program just to do the verification thing [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=914.88s)]
*  Which again hasn't led to more people working and has just kicked people off the program and they're talking about this because they know it's popular [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=919.24s)]
*  Like the again Kaiser Family Foundation did a poll 68 percent of voters supported Medicaid work requirements as described by the House bill [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=924.44s)]
*  But once you'd informed them that the majority of Medicaid recipients were already working and you explained to them sort of the risk of losing [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=931.96s)]
*  Covered that we just talked about via bureaucracy [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=939.7600000000001s)]
*  The support for Medicaid work requirements dropped as low as 35 percent [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=942.72s)]
*  So a 33 point decrease in support for that policy when people really understand it. The hard part is getting people to understand it [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=946.8800000000001s)]
*  So those are the work requirements, but obviously there was a lot more in the bill that passed [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=954.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't know. I wasn't here last week, but I know and I know you haven't got a chance to talk about the [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=959.36s)]
*  The bill broadly yet since it since it passed at least on this podcast [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=964.6400000000001s)]
*  What did you make of the bill now that you've had a few more days to digest like what's actually in it? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=968.48s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it's sort of a combination of the worst of like [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=971.96s)]
*  Reaganomics anti-social safety net with like old-school [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=977.32s)]
*  Disgusting pork barrel politics [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=981.56s)]
*  Like if you look at the tax cuts, here's some people who get or people are entities who get a tax cut [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=983.8399999999999s)]
*  Thanks to this big beautiful bill there the bill eliminates a $200 [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=988.54s)]
*  Firearm registration fee when you purchase a gun silencer. So good news for you. I know you're in the market [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=993.04s)]
*  That's there's a tax break solely for Alaskan fishing boats and processing plants. There's also a special [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=998.04s)]
*  Deduction for Alaskan whaling boat captains. So thank God we're finally helping other people killing whales [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1004.96s)]
*  there's a specific tax break for the [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1010.88s)]
*  Venture capital industry that's gonna cost the rest of us 17 billion dollars [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1014.2s)]
*  2 billion dollar tax break for the rum industry oil and gas industry gets exempted from paying the bare minimum [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1018.0400000000001s)]
*  15% tax on big corporations [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1024.48s)]
*  If you're worth up to 30 million dollars, you no longer have to pay the estate tax if you're a couple [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1026.8s)]
*  Individuals that's exempted up to 14 million [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1033.3999999999999s)]
*  Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos get a special 1 billion dollar provision that will allow them to sell [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1036.2s)]
*  tax-exempt bonds to build spaceports [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1042.3999999999999s)]
*  Very important. What a great what a great gift for Jeff Bezos. You're welcome. Yes over the weekend where he spent [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1045.48s)]
*  50 million dollars to rent Venice was it 50 million 50 million dollars where they basically took over Venice and [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1051.9199999999998s)]
*  Full bunch of private jets there had a big wedding [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1058.8s)]
*  It's the like the split screen of that because it's like most people in the country like I don't know [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1061.0s)]
*  Were they paying attention to the bill or were they paying attention to like all the pop culture? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1066.44s)]
*  Entertainment coverage of the Bezos well [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1069.64s)]
*  No [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1071.32s)]
*  No one was paying attention to the bill because if you you weren't staring a cable like we were it was all ditty coverage [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1071.52s)]
*  And then the Idaho murder case like zero coverage was of this bill is actually very depressing [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1076.64s)]
*  There's also a huge tax break for business owners and people who get paid [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1081.0s)]
*  Through pass-through business entities like s-corps and stuff that costs 800 billion dollars [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1085.64s)]
*  So yeah, I mean this thing is just like your classic [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1093.1200000000001s)]
*  special-interest [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1096.3200000000002s)]

*  Medicaid cuts and then these just idiotic gutting of renewable energy companies [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1102.2s)]
*  Trump is a now. It's got to sell the bill and [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1107.64s)]
*  You know, so he's got best out there and everyone else line about the work requirement stuff [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1111.36s)]
*  They also he's of course. He's also listening enlisting the federal government [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1116.6399999999999s)]
*  In this whole effort propaganda campaign, which you know used to be something that [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1120.44s)]
*  Violated some kind of law and now we're just like oh, whatever [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1125.8799999999999s)]
*  he he had the Social Security Administration supposed to be a [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1129.36s)]
*  Just a just a bunch of civil servants and a nonpartisan entity the Social Security Administration [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1133.44s)]
*  They sent an email to all Social Security beneficiaries [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1138.68s)]
*  Quote celebrating the passage of the one big beautiful bill a landmark piece of legislation that delivers long-awaited tax relief to millions of older Americans [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1141.76s)]
*  That I guess is referring to the provision that temporarily provides a six thousand dollar senior deduction [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1150.48s)]
*  Which is meant to fulfill Trump's campaign promise to end taxes on Social Security [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1156.3200000000002s)]
*  Which the bill doesn't do even though Trump and the White House [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1160.16s)]
*  Keep saying it does just stating his fact that it does is a lie. Yeah [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1163.6000000000001s)]
*  Do you think shit like that works and in just talk about the Social Security thing and then in general [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1167.44s)]
*  Like how easy or difficult do you think it'll be for Trump to make this law popular? [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1172.32s)]
*  using the bully pulpit and sort of I guess the entire federal government [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1178.44s)]
*  I mean [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1182.96s)]
*  I wish I could scoff at like that Social Security email or have faith that people eventually learn [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1183.56s)]
*  That it's a lie when they get their tax bill [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1190.44s)]
*  But I always think back to how powerful it was for Trump to put his name on the stimulus checks [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1192.52s)]
*  And how much that stuck with people and just like a word that this was an official government communication that went to 71 million people [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1196.76s)]
*  71 million people got a total lie from the US government [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1203.96s)]
*  And like this policy like so many policies in this bill does nothing for the poorest seniors [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1207.6s)]
*  It'll help out ones that are wealthier [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1213.72s)]
*  So I'd like some challenges for him in terms of selling this bill [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1216.28s)]
*  It's like the 2017 tax cuts were extended in this bill [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1221.68s)]
*  I would imagine that in 2018 or 19 people like saw [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1225.88s)]
*  That their tax bill went down that won't really be the case here if it's just an extension [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1230.24s)]
*  So maybe that'll help us fight it [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1234.68s)]
*  It's useful that the Cato Institute is saying this is gonna add six trillion in debt to the company [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1236.64s)]
*  Like that's really bad and it's gonna cost us up to 1.9 trillion dollars in debt servicing alone by like 2036 [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1242.68s)]
*  It's nice to see you know voices [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1250.44s)]
*  you don't always see attacking Trump talking about this but like Elon Musk being out there calling it a [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1253.02s)]
*  Disaster utterly insane and destructive like that was a verbatim quote. I think is is really helpful [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1257.76s)]
*  It does suck though like in terms of just helping people feel the impact like [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1264.72s)]
*  The no tax on tips provisions some of the things Trump really wants they go into effect right away [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1269.16s)]
*  But the cuts the Medicaid are delayed a couple years, so we're gonna have to help people understand [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1273.8s)]
*  How bad those are gonna be before there are elections I think that [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1278.1599999999999s)]
*  There's there's two parts to this to the to the selling of this and how people feel about it. I think one is [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1283.6399999999999s)]
*  Which narrative you buy about the bill rather Trump's or what the Democrats are gonna say what we're all gonna say and [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1290.52s)]
*  Part of that is dependent on who makes the better case for some of the stuff that doesn't happen until later [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1297.04s)]
*  then there's just [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1303.0s)]
*  You know I was calling it his economic plan [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1305.24s)]
*  Which I kind of think we go back and forth and like should we call it the bill the beautiful bill this build up [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1307.4s)]
*  But it's like it's his economic plan right and Trump and Republicans they all they went all in on it [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1311.8s)]
*  They said this is our plan to we we ran for Trump ran for president Republicans ran for office [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1316.2s)]
*  just say they're gonna bring down costs because everyone was very pissed about high costs and [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1322.6s)]
*  This is the plan to do that and so now in 2026 [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1327.2s)]
*  People can ask themselves do I feel like I can afford things again do I think the prices are down do I think that I [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1331.4s)]
*  Can afford a house you spend four trillion dollars at a time of? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1338.2s)]
*  High interest rates high prices that haven't come down. Yeah [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1344.0400000000002s)]
*  high costs that haven't come down partly because he has just also [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1347.8400000000001s)]
*  Levied a sales tax essentially with tariffs on [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1353.5200000000002s)]
*  Everything everything we buy from all over the world just as we recorded this today. He announced another like 25% [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1356.9199999999998s)]
*  Terry he sent a letter to South Korea and Japan each telling them like I'm gonna levy 25% [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1364.8799999999999s)]
*  Tariffs on both of your countries so why not and there's gonna be more. I guess Tunisia got a letter to [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1370.12s)]
*  Tunisia Tunisia yeah, okay [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1377.0s)]
*  There's gonna be more of these now and so you're gonna have people paying slightly higher taxes [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1378.56s)]
*  Well it depends on the product on all the stuff they buy and [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1383.52s)]
*  You don't have an you have inflation that has come down [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1387.08s)]
*  But you still have prices that are high interest rates are not coming down anytime soon [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1389.2399999999998s)]
*  Which is why he's yelling at Jerome Powell and like threatening to fire him right and so I think that you can make a case [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1392.28s)]
*  Whether or not some of these provisions go into effect that like hey in 2026 [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1398.9199999999998s)]
*  Are you happy with are you happy with your cost of living? [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1403.4799999999998s)]
*  Are you happy with like what you're able to afford if not then like I thought Donald Trump was supposed to fucking fix it [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1406.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I do think the there's a lot of sort of like macroeconomic factors that will determine how people feel about him in 2026 [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1410.6399999999999s)]
*  And then hopefully not him, but maybe JD Vance in 2028 right yeah if inflation is still high [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1416.76s)]
*  It is very very bad for him and just in terms of like kind of feeling the impact on health care [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1421.96s)]
*  You are starting to see reports of rural hospitals closing or not getting reopened [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1428.56s)]
*  I imagine we're gonna see a lot of that because those rural hospitals are gonna be the ones who are the most [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1433.78s)]
*  Financially impacted by these changes and that's gonna really [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1438.6s)]
*  Impact people's lives if there's no hospital within 50 miles of you all of a sudden. That's you can't live like that [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1442.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and it's a good like that is happening now. There's a new Times piece about a county in Eastern, North Carolina [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1448.4399999999998s)]
*  That's been trying to reopen their one hospital with Medicaid money, which they almost certainly won't be able to do now [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1453.84s)]
*  The key quote from a local real estate agent who's leading the charge said quote not having the hospital here is costing lives [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1461.0s)]
*  This is the most important thing for us [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1467.3s)]
*  one clinic in rural, Nebraska has already closed and [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1469.74s)]
*  The the guy who runs it said in a statement that the expected Medicaid cuts are a reason why they're closing [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1473.3s)]
*  This is this is what I got in a fight with Don Bacon about [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1479.98s)]
*  Don Bacon was like he's like it's a liberals hate work. That's what he tweeted. He goes liberals hate work [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1482.82s)]
*  That's why they're mad about the work requirements work requirements aside like stupid like your own someone in your own state is saying [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1487.62s)]
*  They're closing the hospital. He's like that's a lot [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1493.9s)]
*  How could you say the hospital's gonna close the cuts haven't even gone into effect yet. The bill hasn't even passed [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1496.02s)]
*  I was like, I'm not the one who said it's the fucking Nebraskan who runs the rural county hospital [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1500.3400000000001s)]
*  And I think these stories are why these stories of these rural hospitals closing and this is why like before the bill passed [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1506.26s)]
*  Republicans in Congress were saying stuff like this. The White House has made a commitment [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1514.18s)]
*  The president said over and over and over we're not gonna touch Social Security Medicare or Medicare or Medicaid [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1517.6200000000001s)]
*  We've made the same commitment [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1522.86s)]
*  I am fully committed and I'm leading legislation to make sure that you know, whatever cuts take place in Washington that Medicaid recipients [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1524.1799999999998s)]
*  Don't bear the brunt of that. I've been very clear. I will not support cuts to eligible [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1531.02s)]
*  Beneficiaries on Medicaid if during this budget reconciliation process, they're gonna try to cut rural health care [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1537.58s)]
*  I am NOT on board so much for that tough quotes tough quotes there from all those frontline [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1543.4199999999998s)]
*  So, you know you mentioned some of the Medicaid cuts don't take effect until after the midterms others don't hit until [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1548.66s)]
*  2028 [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1556.8200000000002s)]
*  How do you think that's gonna affect Democrats ability to make this an issue for voters in 2026? Yeah [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1558.46s)]
*  I mean, this is the hard part [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1563.8600000000001s)]
*  I mean priorities USA did some polling they found that half of Americans [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1564.74s)]
*  Nearly half hadn't heard anything about the big beautiful bill and only 8% of all Americans named to Medicaid cuts as the detail of the bill [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1569.18s)]
*  They had heard about [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1575.9s)]
*  That suggests we have a big big messaging challenge [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1577.86s)]
*  I just do think this is gonna have to be we have to find a way to talk about this every single week [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1581.3s)]
*  The Democratic Party I mean, this has got to be relentless because Trump is gonna try to make it about [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1585.02s)]
*  immigration and ice funding and you saw JD Vance's tweets right about how [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1589.86s)]
*  Actually the Medicaid cuts and all this, you know renewable energy that is immaterial [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1594.62s)]
*  I think was the word he used what really matters is [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1599.46s)]
*  Getting all these migrants out of the country and that somehow that's gonna have an economic benefit [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1602.06s)]
*  That's what they want to talk about we have to make sure people understand the reality. I also think [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1606.5s)]
*  You know, you just we mentioned the rural hospitals closing down [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1611.42s)]
*  part of this is [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1616.14s)]
*  He owns the health care system now, right just like we owned the health care system [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1618.7s)]
*  Yeah, when we passed the Affordable Care Act and even though something would happen in health care [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1623.42s)]
*  You know cost would go up or premiums would go up and everyone would blame [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1628.34s)]
*  Obamacare and we'd be like no it was actually was that wasn't Obamacare this hasn't been implemented yet [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1631.64s)]
*  And like people like I don't fucking care. They blame you in charge. So [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1636.14s)]
*  When bad things happen and some of them by the way, like these rural hospitals clothing closing will be because of the law [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1639.92s)]
*  ACA premiums [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1646.76s)]
*  Which you know, one of the things that happened you've mentioned this on the show before they the ACA subsidies [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1648.4s)]
*  That people were getting to bring down their premiums or to help them pay for insurance on the exchanges [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1654.28s)]
*  They were not extended so those ACA premiums [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1659.7s)]
*  XS reported this will probably increase by more than seven and a half percent on average starting in January talk about inflation [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1664.42s)]
*  So that's a that's like January of 2026, you know [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1671.18s)]
*  So that's like a big talking point and actually that probably affects, you know, a lot more [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1674.6200000000001s)]
*  midterm voters [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1680.22s)]
*  Fortunately than some of the people who were on Medicaid that will lose their Medicaid much later and a bunch of hospitals will be doing [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1681.46s)]

*  there's also a couple things we other things we haven't talked about in this bill like [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1846.24s)]
*  the snap cuts people we snap people most people know what snap is but it's food assistance and [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1849.96s)]
*  And [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1854.84s)]
*  Food there's a politico story [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1857.08s)]
*  I saw says food banks aren't ready to handle all the people who will now need them [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1858.68s)]
*  So we're cutting food assistance for a bunch of people [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1862.68s)]
*  Food assistance just like the people gonna go hungry and so they're gonna have to turn to fucking food banks and now food banks aren't [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1866.36s)]
*  Gonna have the capacity to help people [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1871.36s)]
*  Some of these nonprofit organizations have estimated that six to nine billion meals will be eliminated [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1873.8799999999999s)]
*  and [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1880.6s)]
*  Much like the rural hospitals grocery stores in low-income rural areas they rely on [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1881.76s)]
*  Money from people who have food assistance, right? You see it advertised. Yeah [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1889.16s)]
*  And so if they lose that money then some of those grocery stores [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1892.72s)]
*  They're worried or can now close as well [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1896.52s)]
*  The this bill is just so cruel on the merits and I also think that there are changes at least in the house version of the bill [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1898.72s)]
*  that [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1905.64s)]
*  Disaggregated eligibility for snap and Medicaid like some states [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1908.2s)]
*  You just sort of had to apply for one and you were eligible for both and they [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1911.72s)]
*  Split that up to make it just harder to get food or harder to get health care [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1914.72s)]
*  So everything about this is just like bureaucratic cruelty, which it does speak to why? [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1918.0800000000002s)]
*  The votes around the bill you saw a lot of agonized Republicans [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1923.72s)]
*  They all voted for it. But a lot of people like on the merits this thing was just [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1928.3600000000001s)]
*  Awful no one really knows excited no one no one is excited about except like Trump and the biggest sycophants there [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1933.56s)]
*  Yeah, and like, you know big industries. It's also a bill that really sort of [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1939.32s)]
*  robs from robs from future generations and [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1945.04s)]
*  Because I just thought about this with the senior provision the six thousand dollar [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1949.36s)]
*  Senior deduction, which is you pointed out doesn't even go to the poor seniors [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1953.6s)]
*  But for kids for young people [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1957.72s)]
*  Especially like, you know Trump did so well with [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1960.8400000000001s)]
*  Gen Z in this election college loans are gonna become more expensive right because they cut college loans [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1963.8s)]
*  So the typical loan recipient with a college degree and an annual income of $80,000 is gonna have to pay [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1969.28s)]
*  $3,000 more per year now [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1976.6000000000001s)]
*  So this is like so we're giving seniors wealthier seniors are gonna get like a little bit of a tax deduction that only lasts until [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1978.88s)]
*  2028 but [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1985.36s)]
*  People just starting out looking for jobs are gonna be paying more in college loans [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1986.96s)]
*  And it'll also make Social Security insolvent a couple years earlier [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1990.28s)]
*  Yes [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1993.28s)]
*  So and then of course adding to the debt means that like, you know [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1993.76s)]
*  Our children and grandchildren are gonna end up paying higher interest rates and have to pay this off later [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=1997.12s)]
*  So it's bad [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2001.56s)]
*  One good piece of news is that our friends at vote save America are launching a really cool new program on candidate recruitment for local offices [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2004.1599999999999s)]
*  We'll have more on the details of that a bit later in the show [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2010.9199999999998s)]
*  But it seems pretty clear that we need more people fired up and running for office [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2013.4399999999998s)]
*  any other ideas before we move off of this on how [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2017.4799999999998s)]
*  Democrats compete keep this bill in people's minds over the next 16 months [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2020.84s)]
*  I just I'm very cognizant of the fact that like it seems like a big deal now [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2024.6799999999998s)]
*  Even if the midterms were this November where we're sitting here. What's July this November? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2029.6799999999998s)]
*  It would be hard to like keep people remembering this we have 16 months to make this election about [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2034.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it's gonna be very difficult. I mean first of all, I just want to say on this candidate recruitment idea [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2040.84s)]
*  a [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2045.3999999999999s)]
*  Midterm election like this is a really big opportunity [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2046.56s)]
*  I think for Democrats we need candidates running at every level for every single office [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2049.68s)]
*  The odds are there will be headwinds for Trump and the Republican Party. The odds are we'll win [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2055.08s)]
*  Elections we might not otherwise be competitive in so if you're thinking about running check out vote save America site [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2060.52s)]
*  And consider this being the year you do it because it's really really really important [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2066.8s)]
*  I just think you know, yes in 16 months God knows what we'll be talking about, right? [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2070.88s)]
*  There could be a war there could be a terrorist attack. There could be who knows what? [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2074.8s)]
*  I do think just continuing to highlight the stories we talked about the community hospitals closing the individuals who get hurt the people who lost [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2078.44s)]
*  Their food stamps or their coverage like [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2087.04s)]
*  Personalizing this kind of wonky policy story is going to be the key and just doing events and talking about this like Democrats have been great [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2089.6s)]
*  over the last few months about doing town halls in [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2095.7599999999998s)]
*  Republican districts [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2099.24s)]
*  That's a great way to make sure that some of those constituents at least are hearing about these terrible votes [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2101.64s)]
*  I hope Democrats are going to every one of the like targeted districts all the time and talking about this bill [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2107.04s)]
*  And just kind of pounding it. Yeah, and I think [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2114.4s)]
*  The one thing we have going for us is you know, you're trying to flip the house. These are district level [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2118.44s)]
*  Campaigns so [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2124.04s)]
*  You know the problem that we run into in presidential elections is [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2126.24s)]
*  There's a whole bunch of voters who just don't pay much attention and it's hard to reach them because they're not following the news [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2131.0s)]
*  You know, you're running a campaign in a house district. You could reach a lot more people. Yeah, and so I think you know [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2135.4399999999996s)]
*  What's a of America has the list? [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2142.7999999999997s)]
*  But this is the list of people we were trying to get everyone to call like, you know [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2144.04s)]
*  David Valadeo in California who has you know more Medicaid recipients in his district than anyone else in the country [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2147.68s)]
*  and also by the way is is [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2154.9199999999996s)]
*  Represents a lot of farmers people in the agriculture industry who are getting deported [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2157.72s)]
*  So I think whoever runs against whoever ends up running against David Valadeo. That's a that's a pretty pretty solid campaign [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2162.9199999999996s)]
*  You can run there. Yeah, so Hocking Jeffries office put out some specific stats on the impact district by district David Valadeo [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2168.8399999999997s)]
*  They estimate 65,000 people would lose access to health care from this bill [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2176.48s)]
*  60,000 households could lose access to food assistance and then 3600 energy jobs could be lost [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2181.2799999999997s)]
*  So that's pretty specific about the bill and the district and worth just hammered [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2185.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, and I do think like you said every piece of bad news directly related to this bill or not [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2190.3599999999997s)]
*  Whether it's with the economy health care [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2196.68s)]
*  We still have the doge cuts that are taking effects and stuff like that [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2198.7999999999997s)]
*  Like you just we just got to make them own it every from now until the midterms [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2201.7599999999998s)]
*  one part of the bill we haven't talked about as much is the [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2205.4s)]
*  170 billion dollars it spends to supercharge Trump's mass deportation regime [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2208.8399999999997s)]
*  Ice will now become the country's largest federal law enforcement agency bigger than the FBI bigger than the DEA [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2214.48s)]
*  Stephen Miller gets to hire 10,000 new ice agents that are that he's basically responsible for they basically report to him since [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2222.04s)]
*  Christina was like, you know just the face of the Department of Homeland Security [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2228.88s)]
*  But Miller's really the boss. Yeah, and [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2232.6800000000003s)]
*  Same thing is true. I guess with the Department of Justice [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2236.1600000000003s)]
*  This is Jason's annually had a whole piece about Stephen Miller in the New York Times where everyone's saying that he's he's the real power [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2238.6400000000003s)]
*  Center that all these cabinet secretaries they're just sort of there to go on TV. Yeah [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2245.48s)]
*  So Miller gets to hire 10,000 new ice agents. They're gonna build enough new detention centers to hold more than a hundred thousand people [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2250.32s)]
*  Ice's new budget will be larger than most of the world's militaries including Israel's [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2257.96s)]
*  the idea that we're gonna have ice that has a bigger budget than the IDF is a [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2263.52s)]
*  Scary. Yeah [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2269.2400000000002s)]
*  And this is all so that they can hit Stephen Miller's goal of 1 million deportations per year [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2271.76s)]
*  Which they're trying to reach by arresting every immigrant they can find even people without criminal records even people who are here legally [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2277.2s)]
*  This is certainly what some Trump voters wanted but not all of them here's one prominent Trump supporter from a few days ago [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2284.2s)]
*  It's insane. Yeah, we were told there would be no well, there's two things that are insane [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2290.0s)]
*  One is the targeting of migrant workers not cartel members not gang members not [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2296.24s)]
*  drug dealers just construction workers [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2305.3199999999997s)]
*  Showing up in construction sites and raiding them [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2308.92s)]
*  Gardeners, yeah, like really and of course was Joe Rogan [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2312.2400000000002s)]
*  I love it on on a recent episode of his podcast [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2315.6s)]
*  so I know Democrats haven't been talking as much about this part of the bill because [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2318.1200000000003s)]
*  The Medicaid cuts and the tax cuts for the richer are much more unpopular at least according to the polls [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2322.56s)]
*  I still think it's maybe the most alarming part of the new law. What do you think? It's terrifying [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2327.6s)]
*  I mean the idea of this just sort of like hybrid [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2332.44s)]
*  Militarized police force running through our cities. It's very scary. I also think I think it's a real opportunity [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2335.62s)]
*  To talk about ICE agents wearing masks. I think blue states need to pass laws [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2341.66s)]
*  Requiring ICE agents to show their faces show proper ID [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2347.7s)]
*  I would love to force a big fight over that because like who who disagrees with that idea? Yeah [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2350.7599999999998s)]
*  but I also think like there was early on Democrats are very [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2356.7799999999997s)]
*  Unsteady when talking about immigration [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2360.2999999999997s)]
*  I just think they have to understand that the ground has shifted a bit like Pew just had a big survey last month on a [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2363.5s)]
*  bunch of immigration stuff that was useful [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2369.54s)]
*  54% of voters disapprove of increasing ICE raids on workplaces [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2371.9s)]
*  60% of Americans oppose suspending most asylum applications [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2376.2999999999997s)]
*  59% oppose ending TPS for immigrants who fled war or natural disasters [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2381.22s)]
*  65% of the country says there should be way for immigrants to stay in the country legally if they're meeting certain requirements in [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2386.58s)]
*  61% of Americans disapprove of sending immigrants to prison in El Salvador [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2392.2999999999997s)]
*  So the original fight we're having about this that everyone was worried about like oh no [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2397.2999999999997s)]
*  Should we be talking about kilmer or brigo Garcia or these Venezuelan men who were sent El Salvador like? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2401.9s)]
*  Vast majority of the country thinks that's fucked up and wrong and shouldn't happen [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2407.58s)]
*  I don't know if we're seeing this more just because we live in Los Angeles [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2411.34s)]
*  But the videos of yeah these ICE raids that you want today. Yeah, which one there's one in California in Los Angeles [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2415.58s)]
*  Oh and MacArthur at MacArthur Park. I think [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2423.18s)]
*  Yeah, I guess Karen Bass went down there too. Thanks. Oh, but like there's nothing [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2426.1s)]
*  Karen Bass can do right? You know, she's there to witness it, but there's nothing else you could do [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2430.1s)]
*  No, there's like they're hitting up all the car washes. Yeah, there's these these people have worked there for like 20 30 years [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2434.98s)]
*  They're just grabbing them and and it's it's the masks. Like you said [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2440.62s)]
*  It's also the they're in plain clothes often. They're always in unmarked vehicles almost [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2444.12s)]
*  My like my Instagram feed is filled with these videos [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2450.56s)]
*  My tech talk feed is filled with these videos and you know [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2453.52s)]
*  I always double-check them too to see if they're you know, they're real or not [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2456.7599999999998s)]
*  Are you worried about that? But most of them are from like local news [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2460.08s)]
*  broadcasts which by the way [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2464.04s)]
*  Like I do, you know [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2465.96s)]
*  you go on social media and you as you and I do a lot tweet about this and you get a bunch of like [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2467.4s)]
*  Maggot crazies that are like this is what we voted for to the poll numbers that you just mentioned people who are [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2472.92s)]
*  Home watching the local news, which is some news sometimes that's the only news people are getting they're not paying attention to nationalists [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2479.88s)]
*  They're just watching their local news are seeing these raids all the time and I bet that they're fucking terrified [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2485.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean like the stories of the guy who got the shit kicked out of him [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2490.48s)]
*  Thing was in San Diego and three of the Suns served in the Marines [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2494.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean stories like that offend everyone the number of people I know and know of [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2497.68s)]
*  here in Los Angeles who are [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2503.28s)]
*  They're documented their legal residents. They may not be citizens, but their legal residents and they are [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2505.92s)]
*  Canceling plans afraid to leave the house [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2511.08s)]
*  Afraid to go to work for a student graduation free to go into graduations because of this is yeah [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2514.48s)]
*  Is wild that that is the real story of these raids? [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2520.92s)]
*  It is communities being terrorized mostly Latino communities and Trump wants us to be [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2524.52s)]
*  brave law enforcement agents [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2529.0s)]
*  Versus the sanctuary cities who oppose them and coddle criminals. The reality is very very different [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2531.38s)]
*  It is people going to Home Depot kicking the shit out of [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2537.84s)]
*  People who may or may not be undocumented. There's been some really high-profile mistakes [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2542.28s)]
*  I think we just have to constantly lift up those examples and talk about them and and I think the truly scary thing about this [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2546.0s)]
*  On the on the detail on the arrest side, you know [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2550.84s)]
*  It's like warrantless arrests with you know guys with masks on and their arms stuff like that [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2554.84s)]
*  But then on the judicial side, it's not like a real judicial system half the time, right? [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2560.08s)]
*  Like they're thrown in detention centers [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2565.08s)]
*  Lost yes, you know eventually you can get a lawyer and you can get into court or whatever [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2567.36s)]
*  But they're just you know, alligator Alcatraz. They're just like building they have they have the National Guard now acting as [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2571.2000000000003s)]
*  Helping helping to like run the immigration judicial system in these quasi judicial system and alligator Alcatraz and some of these fucking detention centers [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2579.0s)]
*  It's wild. Yeah, the alligator Alcatraz thing is just so weird [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2587.56s)]
*  I mean the way Republicans are sort of like fetishizing it to do you think that fucking creep Benny Johnson second time [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2591.84s)]
*  We mentioned on the show showing off his alligator Alcatraz merch and then Trump was joking with reporters that [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2598.1600000000003s)]
*  If you escape you need to learn to run in a zigzag fashion so you don't get eaten by an alligator [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2605.8s)]
*  And again, it's like Laura Loomer. I think you brought that. Yeah, Laura Loomer [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2611.7200000000003s)]
*  Essentially tweeted like 65 million more to go, which is the aggregate number of Latinos in this country [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2616.4s)]
*  So it's the more to go about like alligators eating them [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2621.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2624.04s)]
*  Suggesting we should send them all to jail and then have them eaten and like less than 10% of people arrested or booked by ice [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2624.2400000000002s)]
*  Are accused of violent crimes? [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2629.44s)]
*  And suggesting that they should go to a prison where they get eaten by an alligator [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2631.84s)]
*  I think most people are like what the fuck are you talking about? And you know, obviously we've already [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2636.2000000000003s)]
*  We're seeing the dangers of giving Stephen Miller nice this much power on Monday. The Department of Justice [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2641.52s)]
*  Told judge Paula Zinnis that if Kilmer or Brego Garcia gets released on bond in his criminal case in Tennessee [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2647.2000000000003s)]
*  They will deport him to a third country [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2653.32s)]
*  Which the Supreme Court officially cleared the way for them to do in a pair of recent rulings one of which [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2655.8s)]
*  Allowed the administration to send eight man to South Sudan even though only one of them is from there [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2661.48s)]
*  So now the floodgates are open to sending to deporting people to third countries and a third country by the way is you know [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2667.2400000000002s)]
*  A country that's not your country that you like you so you're deported from the United States not to the country where you came [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2673.88s)]
*  From but just somewhere you probably have never been before. Yeah [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2679.32s)]
*  And so that can happen now last week in a court filing a Brego Garcia's lawyers also alleged that he was subject to severe [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2682.76s)]
*  Beatings and psychological torture during his time in El Salvador's Seacot mega prison [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2689.02s)]
*  And the administration also just made another fifty thousand legal residents eligible for deportation by terminating [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2694.42s)]
*  Temporary protected status for a hundred and Nicaraguan immigrants. They've had temporary protected status for those two countries since [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2701.26s)]
*  1999 yeah, these people have been here for decades [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2708.02s)]
*  so [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2710.7000000000003s)]
*  The administration seems to think shipping people off to foreign torture prisons and war-torn countries [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2712.1s)]
*  They've never been to will deter other immigrants from coming here illegally that might be true certainly border crossings are have almost completely stopped [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2716.98s)]
*  Yeah, but what happens when people from Honduras or Nicaragua or Venezuela or Haiti who've been here legally for years? [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2725.54s)]
*  Get their temporary protected status revoked and end up in Seacot or South Sudan or one of these countries or alligator Alcatraz [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2733.9s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I just quickly on the Sudan thing [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2741.66s)]
*  South Sudan became a country in 2011 within like two years the country descended to civil war there was like a fragile [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2745.0800000000004s)]
*  Ceasefire power sharing agreement in 2018, but then in 2023 there was a civil war in Sudan [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2752.92s)]
*  Their neighbor to the north so that led to an exodus of refugees and fighting in like intertribal and ethnic warfare and basically in [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2759.7200000000003s)]
*  2025 there was a political crisis and clashes between the government and and opposition forces that led [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2767.4s)]
*  The UN peacekeeping mission there to warn that they were on the brink of a full-scale civil war and we're just sending [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2772.66s)]
*  Migrants who have no connection to South Sudan to a country where they know no one have no opportunity [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2779.42s)]
*  Where 10 million people are? [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2785.54s)]
*  On the brink of starvation where it's about to descend into civil war [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2788.18s)]
*  Why to scare a few more people from going up like the Darien gap but again? [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2792.14s)]
*  It's like it's and that would be horrific enough, you know [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2797.82s)]
*  But now [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2800.8599999999997s)]
*  Because they are stripping people of their temporary protected status, right? [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2802.2999999999997s)]
*  So people who have been here like I said 1999. Yeah, so they have they're working here. They're living here [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2806.8599999999997s)]
*  They have families here. They know no other country and so what happens to them when they get rounded up by ice [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2812.66s)]
*  Maybe they go to alligator Alcatraz. Maybe they go to some other detention center. Maybe they get deported to see caught [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2818.46s)]

*  Yep, and to your point about South Sudan [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2919.7999999999997s)]
*  They were very quick to say oh the eight people that we sent to South Sudan were the worst of the worst and they had [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2921.96s)]
*  Like their rap sheets and it's like, you know child rapist and murder and stuff like that [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2926.64s)]

*  horrific crimes, right but [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2937.14s)]
*  if they [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2939.7999999999997s)]
*  admit [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2941.24s)]
*  Publicly that a brego Garcia was just caught up [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2942.56s)]
*  Mistakenly and sent to see cut space then everyone's gonna start saying what about Andre Hernandez? [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2946.2799999999997s)]
*  It just unravels what about everyone else and then suddenly we're like, oh now we're sending people to these torture dungeons [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2950.8799999999997s)]

*  All they've done is either I don't know overstayed a visa or or tried to come to the country for a better life or had [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2961.24s)]
*  Protected status right and remember, you know [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2967.8999999999996s)]
*  Naib ukele the president of El Salvador [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2970.02s)]
*  He cut this deal to accept these men down in El Salvador because in part he wanted to get back a bunch of [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2971.8199999999997s)]
*  hardened senior MS 13 leaders who were being prosecuted in New York and who could provide evidence [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2978.62s)]
*  About his government's deals with the gangs. So he wanted to get those guys back so they couldn't be you know testify against him [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2985.58s)]
*  So that's that's the background of this whole thing [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2993.16s)]
*  And meanwhile our president is so stupid that he thought [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=2995.56s)]
*  A brego Garcia had the letters MS and the numbers 13 [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3000.2s)]
*  Tattooed on his hand when it was like the worst Photoshop MS paint job you've ever seen [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3004.52s)]
*  Meanwhile like the according to this filing by a break Garcia [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3011.06s)]
*  They separated out prisoners with gang tattoos and put them in one cell and everybody else in another he was in the non gang [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3015.3999999999996s)]
*  Tattoo cell and in fact one of the guards told him your tattoos are fine. Like they know this guy's not a gang member [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3022.96s)]
*  It's only our moron president who seems to think he literally had MS 13 written on his hand. Did you see how? [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3029.08s)]
*  Bukele responded to the filing no, so Bukele responded to this by [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3034.92s)]
*  posting a video of a brego Garcia in his cell in the in the prison that they transferred him to because remember when Van [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3040.2s)]
*  Holland went down [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3047.12s)]
*  They had transferred a brego Garcia from C Cot to another prison and in this and at the time by the way [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3047.8199999999997s)]
*  Everyone had reported. Oh this prison is a better prison with better conditions [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3054.02s)]
*  I think Van Holland said that once he went down there [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3057.88s)]
*  So they have videos of him in there and they have a video of him watching TV [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3059.8199999999997s)]
*  They have a TV on and he's he's fully clothed and he's got he doesn't have a uniform on he's just wearing his clothes [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3063.58s)]
*  And he's like sitting with Van Holland for a drink and so and all these fucking MAGA people. They're just buying it [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3068.3599999999997s)]
*  They're like see or or they're just in on the lie [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3074.04s)]
*  Either or but like yeah, so they're trying to just make it a propaganda thing. They're like, oh no [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3076.72s)]
*  No, he's fine. He's just lying in this court filing, but it's like yeah, we know that's a different fucking prison [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3081.7799999999997s)]
*  These are the same idiots who believed it when Bukele's thugs put margaritas in front of a brego Garcia and [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3085.44s)]
*  Van Holland right like that. He's a clown. He's a marketer like this is how he rose to power [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3092.56s)]
*  He's just good at PR and all this bullshit [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3096.54s)]
*  I [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3099.2s)]
*  Hope like some of the Bitcoin people that cut deals with him early on because like El Salvador kind of [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3100.2799999999997s)]
*  Really exploded onto the map a few years ago [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3106.72s)]
*  But Bukele decided to really embrace Bitcoin and he wanted to make it like this [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3108.58s)]
*  Crypto future city and he talked about like building an entire Bitcoin [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3113.3999999999996s)]
*  City powered by volcano like the dumbest shit you've ever heard in your life [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3118.12s)]
*  But all these Silicon Valley idiots embraced him and I hope they're doing a little bit of soul-searching on this [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3121.68s)]
*  I have been watching that and [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3126.9599999999996s)]

*  You see like some of the all-in guys are like, I don't know about this [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3147.68s)]
*  this is bad because those morons had Trump on their show and they thought they baited him into saying that like tech founders or [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3151.16s)]
*  like foreign students who are really high-performing who get diplomas in the United States would then get a pathway to citizenship and of course [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3159.0s)]

*  citizens United citizens who became citizens and [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3181.84s)]
*  Put them through denaturalization [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3184.92s)]
*  Proceedings and yeah, do I think like that ends up at the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court's like this is fucked up [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3187.04s)]
*  I don't know. I'd like to the hope so but we have you know [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3192.48s)]
*  Alien enemies act is proof that we have these really dumb fucking old laws on the books [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3195.6s)]
*  And the court's job is to interpret the law and they could be like, I don't know [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3199.68s)]
*  I have no confidence in the courts anymore. Not the Supreme Court. Yeah, it's really scary [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3203.48s)]
*  And you know, it's it was very clear early on that they decided to go after [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3208.12s)]
*  Pro-Palestine protesters is kind of a test to see how much they could curtail free speech and [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3212.88s)]
*  Intimidate opponents and I was pretty effective [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3218.44s)]
*  but just to wrap this up like I do think I [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3220.52s)]
*  Realize, you know [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3224.08s)]
*  You could pull this a million different ways and you you pointed out how the polling has changed on immigration [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3225.24s)]
*  But like yes, let's talk about the Medicaid cuts. Yes, absolutely [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3230.72s)]
*  Talk about tax cuts for the rich like those are at the top of the list [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3234.48s)]
*  But [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3237.8s)]
*  Just from a pure I think it's the right thing to do [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3238.92s)]
*  Obviously, we're obviously outraged by all the deportations and the immigration stuff [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3241.6000000000004s)]
*  But just from if you just wanted to be purely political about it [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3245.92s)]
*  people seeing their communities torn apart because [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3250.6400000000003s)]

*  ripping their colleagues away and [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3259.5200000000004s)]
*  Disappearing them somewhere like that's gonna be fucking unpopular. That is worth talking about from now until the midterms [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3262.0800000000004s)]
*  I agree. Also, there's 483 days until the midterms. We're gonna talk about a lot of stuff everybody and I just in in 18 [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3267.2s)]
*  You know, we've talked about immigration has gone back and forth in 18 talking about immigration worked [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3275.16s)]
*  It was Trump was very child separate family separation was very unpopular [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3279.72s)]
*  The caravan bullshit didn't work for them, you know, so I just think it's a different [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3283.96s)]
*  Immigration is a catch-all for a lot of different shit and people feel differently about different aspects of it [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3289.3599999999997s)]
*  What he's doing is not popular [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3293.54s)]
*  So we mentioned earlier that vote save America is launching a drive to recruit candidates for local races. Here's the deal [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3295.06s)]
*  this is a pilot program that they're launching and [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3302.1s)]
*  Trying to recruit [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3306.1s)]

*  Then we say our audiences we mean you you this is a this is a program where we are hoping that some of you who? [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3313.5s)]
*  Listen to this who live in Arizona, North Carolina and Texas think you know what I should run for office and doesn't have to be [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3320.34s)]
*  House Senate's you don't run against president [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3328.46s)]

*  there's hundreds maybe even thousands of races where no Democrat runs and [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3337.98s)]
*  Look 2026 we hope will be a big year for Democrats. We hope their head wins for Donald Trump [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3343.1000000000004s)]
*  We hope we win a lot of races and if we're not running in places, we can't win [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3348.1s)]
*  so we're hoping you will consider taking this next up and [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3351.82s)]
*  The team picked Arizona, North Carolina and Texas because these are three states that you know, they're purple states [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3355.62s)]
*  They've yeah, Texas is always out there as we're hoping that we can turn but look if we want to if we want to have a majority [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3362.22s)]
*  In this country majority in the Senate if we want to have a majority in electoral college if we want actually just build power [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3368.62s)]
*  These are three states that we have to flip and and and flipping them is not just like on the presidential level or on [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3374.9s)]

*  Let's listen [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3683.94s)]
*  I think it's ridiculous to start a third party. We have a [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3685.94s)]
*  Tremendous success with the Republican Party [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3688.94s)]

*  But I think it's ridiculous [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3706.1s)]

*  Regulatory tax credits that are designed to encourage automakers to make low emission vehicles [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3757.3s)]

*  What do you think about the third party maneuver? Do you think? [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3805.06s)]
*  You think this is gonna happen he's so full of shit, I don't believe it for a second like [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3807.7799999999997s)]
*  spraying [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3812.2599999999998s)]
*  300 million dollars on pro Trump ads in Pennsylvania or whatever and like [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3813.62s)]
*  Jumping up and down like an idiot at rallies like that. That's easy. That's fun [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3818.5s)]
*  Building a political party from the from scratch. That's hard. That's a slog. You're talking about ballot access and [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3823.66s)]
*  Creating, you know rules and bylaws and policy positions and this and that like I don't think he's got the time or time [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3830.62s)]
*  Attention for this it's just like every other fucking tech billionaire who thinks [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3837.2599999999998s)]
*  They could run the government better than every other politician and then sure enough soon as you get into it [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3841.2599999999998s)]
*  You're like, oh, this is a little more complicated than I thought just like when Elon did doge and all of a sudden left [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3846.74s)]
*  There's been like oh it was much harder to cut government than I thought [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3852.7799999999997s)]
*  He's gonna realize that creating a fucking political party is pretty hard because it's not a national thing [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3854.98s)]
*  It's state by state. So in every state has their own rules [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3860.74s)]
*  You know, like you said, he still hasn't filed with the FEC but like the state level regulations can be really burdensome [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3865.06s)]
*  They're burdensome even for the third parties that are on the ballots that we see the Green Party [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3870.7799999999997s)]
*  Party like right they still have to get access every election cycle [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3875.9s)]
*  That's our FK. Yeah, exactly right like in Georgia. Apparently that's got one of the stricter laws [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3880.98s)]
*  You need 27,000 signatures per district if you're running for Congress [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3886.22s)]
*  And so no third-party candidate has been on the ballot in Georgia since 1985 because it's so difficult [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3890.46s)]
*  so like the idea that Elon Musk is going to spend forget about the money the time and [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3894.94s)]
*  And like to have a political platform and a program that appeals to enough people. I just don't see it [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3900.62s)]
*  Also, like he's let's be honest. He's not creating a party [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3905.7s)]
*  He's trying to create a cult of personality and who is Elon Musk currently appealing to like he's burning all the MAGA people now [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3908.58s)]

*  Yeah, kind of like the rich sort of squishy middle centrist, you know low-tax rich guys [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3926.86s)]
*  But it's like the people who is like the Howard Schultz party. Remember? Yeah, exactly [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3933.66s)]
*  Exactly Schultz flirting with us. It's like we need some well it used to be we need someone who's like [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3937.98s)]
*  Financially, you know moderate on economics and centrist financially but but like socially liberal [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3943.5s)]
*  But but Elon Musk isn't even socially liberal anymore [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3950.1800000000003s)]
*  He's not socially liberal and he's sort of I mean [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3952.9s)]
*  The defining image of his time at Doge is him waving around a chainsaw on stage [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3955.94s)]
*  like no one thinks he's kind of got all his marbles as he as he made it possible to kill like [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3959.94s)]
*  Thousands of millions of poor kids all over the world [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3964.5800000000004s)]
*  So I don't I don't now he did say that it might just be a few districts, right? [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3967.46s)]
*  Like if it's a close it's a close house race and close Senate race [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3972.42s)]
*  Maybe he picks one or two candidates to primary a Republican who voted for the bill and a couple districts [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3976.02s)]
*  I don't know if that's maybe you can have a party and just one or two states that works [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3982.34s)]
*  But I still think he loses interest in this. Yeah, I just think it's a stupid [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3988.2s)]
*  Strategy if you want primary primary them, is it just to like piss off Trump? Yeah [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3992.06s)]
*  Yeah [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3997.46s)]
*  And Trump will punish him right like Trump. Oh, yeah been quite clear. I will punish you if you do this [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=3998.5s)]
*  Yeah, okay naturalize him put up or shut up buddy. Yeah, remember he's gonna [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4003.66s)]
*  Yeah, I forgot the whole cycle. I guess I was gone but he was gonna deport Elon. Yeah, well bannons trying to look into it [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4007.06s)]
*  Yeah, he's gonna look into deporting Elon Musk. So that's he's gonna work. He's gonna doge Elon [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4012.14s)]
*  Maybe the surest sign of how punchy Elon's feeling came in the form of a tweet at 102 a.m [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4017.46s)]
*  On Monday [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4021.7400000000002s)]
*  Elon's post featured an image of a digital countdown clock reading zero across the board and labeled the official Jeffrey Epstein pedophile arrest counter [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4022.62s)]
*  I don't know. That was the thing [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4030.7799999999997s)]
*  Elon added the caption. What's the time? Oh, look, it's no one has been arrested o'clock again [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4032.66s)]
*  Elon of course tweeted during the initial breakup that Trump hasn't released the Epstein files because Trump himself is in the Epstein files [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4038.34s)]
*  But the lightly the likely trigger for this post was the news that Trump's FBI and DOJ have determined [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4045.74s)]
*  That there is no Jeffrey Epstein client list [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4051.8599999999997s)]
*  There's no evidence that Epstein blackmailed any of his very prominent friends like Donald Trump and there's no evidence that Epstein was the victim [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4055.3399999999997s)]
*  of a murder and cover-up [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4062.5s)]
*  Maga influencers haven't been taking this well partly because back in February [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4064.98s)]
*  Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News that Epstein's client list was quote sitting on my desk right now to review [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4068.22s)]
*  Here's how Caroline Levitt tried to explain away the misconception to Fox News as Peter Ducey during Monday's press briefing [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4074.3399999999997s)]
*  So what happened to the Epstein client list that the Attorney General said she had on her desk? [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4080.94s)]
*  Well, I think if you go back and look at what the Attorney General said in that interview [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4086.62s)]
*  Which was on your network on Fox News [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4090.82s)]
*  She was saying the entirety of all of the paperwork all of the paper in relation to Jeffrey Epstein's crimes [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4092.58s)]
*  That's what the Attorney General was referring to and I'll let her speak for that [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4099.02s)]
*  Well, they should put all the conspiracies to rest don't you think not gonna cut it? [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4102.46s)]
*  John and I did a long YouTube exclusive on the Pod Save America account where we dug into justice for about 15 minutes [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4106.46s)]
*  If you want a lot more detail, I highly recommend it also subscribe [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4112.86s)]
*  you know you do America YouTube because we're trying to build a [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4115.7s)]
*  Democratic counterbalance to all the right-wing garbage you find on YouTube when you search political news [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4118.74s)]
*  but I have to say I watched a bunch of [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4122.42s)]
*  Like right wing podcasts and media today. I watched a lot of Alex Jones and they are melting down [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4125.62s)]
*  They are losing their minds like I think this is one that stays. I think so [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4130.9s)]
*  Because it's not gonna go away [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4135.299999999999s)]
*  like this is still a thing that [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4136.7s)]
*  They claim to care deeply about because they think that it would lead to the taking down of some evil satanic cabal of Democrats [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4139.219999999999s)]
*  led by Jeffrey Epstein Bill Clinton blah blah blah [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4146.54s)]
*  But like Alex Jones like he sort of built an audience in a career off of this [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4149.46s)]
*  He's not gonna let this go just because Trump says so I mean they certainly didn't when Dan Bongino and cash Patel [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4153.339999999999s)]
*  first said Epstein didn't [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4159.9s)]
*  That Epstein did kill himself like a month or two ago like that just poured gas on the fire [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4162.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they are really upset. I mean Alex Jones referred it to [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4167.139999999999s)]
*  the DOJ committing seppuku, which is jamming a sword into your stomach and then up into your heart and [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4170.62s)]
*  It's you know, he weaves this like crazy conspiracy theory about how actually [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4177.379999999999s)]
*  Trump is using this to neutralize the deep states. They don't kill him and now he can really go that's it's insane. But um [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4182.54s)]
*  It's not going over well, it is not going over well on the far right [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4190.58s)]
*  It's I realize it's not funny because at the heart of this is a horrific scandal [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4194.1s)]
*  You know Jeffrey Epstein did horrible horrible things [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4199.18s)]
*  But these fucking idiots who have been pushing this conspiracy theory for however many years and it was always a little bit ridiculous [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4201.5s)]
*  to think that [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4209.42s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein would sort of document all the people he was blackmailing on a list and just kind of keep it in his pocket [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4210.860000000001s)]
*  Waiting for the day where if he was somehow murdered and covered up that someone would be able to reveal the list and that it wouldn't [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4217.339999999999s)]
*  Leak until then until Donald Trump ascended back into the White House and gave the okay [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4224.94s)]
*  But like, you know, and it's of course of course even when they get their own conspiracy theorists in positions of power [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4229.82s)]
*  The most power you could have running the federal government running federal law enforcement agencies [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4237.339999999999s)]
*  Even when they get there and say no, by the way, it's uh, it's there's nothing here [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4242.5199999999995s)]
*  That's it's still not gonna convince them [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4247.5199999999995s)]
*  Trump is always the strong man who can take care of everything [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4249.639999999999s)]
*  But also the victim of the deep state when anything goes wrong and it drives me absolutely insane [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4253.4s)]
*  I mean the the conspiracy you gotta say that you grievance politics requires that you're always a victim [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4257.759999999999s)]
*  Even if you have all the power humanly possible all the power in the world [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4262.679999999999s)]
*  I mean the conspiracy the the Epstein's ties with people in power have always been hiding in plain sight [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4266.4s)]
*  Like in the 2017 interview with Michael Wolf Jeffrey Epstein claimed that at one point he was Trump's closest friend [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4271.84s)]
*  Trump's first secretary of labor Alex Acosta is the guy who gave Epstein the sweetheart deal back in the late 2000s [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4278.92s)]
*  that allowed him to basically serve almost no time and [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4288.12s)]
*  Do a six-day week work release and get immunity from future prosecution [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4291.92s)]
*  And so like the lawyers for Epstein were Alan Dershowitz Trump's good buddy who was Ken star [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4296.400000000001s)]
*  It's like the the conspiracy is right there. Like this is a terrible human being who victimized like a thousand young women [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4302.12s)]
*  Got away with murder because he was rich and powerful and connected and that is the story [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4310.76s)]
*  It's not I mean as far as we know [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4315.6s)]
*  It is not that he is like secretly working for the massage and mi6 in the CIA and the deep state somehow [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4317.72s)]
*  Was you're running this prosecution like I sorry guys. It's just not it's not as interesting as that [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4325.16s)]
*  I want I want Alex Jones and all those people to know that the list is probably still out there [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4330.16s)]
*  It could mean I think they probably think it is [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4334.5599999999995s)]
*  I would not I would not give up good luck finding it because Donald Trump promised you to release it and JD Vance said [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4337.32s)]
*  It was very important to do and also hold Caroline Levitt's feet to the fire next time you go into that briefing room [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4343.2s)]
*  You're one of those bloggers or those whatever fucking the lunatics. They got there. Keep asking her this don't don't let up [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4348.36s)]
*  I do think the professional class like the Alex Jones is they'll figure out a way to move on but there will be a lot [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4354.7s)]
*  of regular people who [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4359.98s)]
*  Went down a rabbit hole about Jeffrey Epstein. They probably truly believe that there's a cabal of like [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4362.5s)]
*  Evil pedophiles in charge of the world and the fact that Donald Trump is not doing anything about it [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4368.42s)]
*  How do you let go that let me tell you those people aren't so regular? [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4373.66s)]
*  That's our show for today. I will be back on Friday with a new show with a special guest host and Stan's gonna be on vacation [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4376.5s)]
*  I'm gonna be talking with MSNBC's Alex Wagner. So talk to you all then [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv5UE4riNH0&t=4382.34s)]
