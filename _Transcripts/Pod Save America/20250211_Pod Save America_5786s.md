Video Description: Federal judges are starting to do something most elected Republicans won't: say no to Donald Trump and Elon Musk. The question now is, will Trump obey their orders? Jon, Lovett, and Tommy break down all the latest, including new onslaughts against the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the National Institutes of Health, and new allegations of Trump family grift. Then, Jon sits down with @strictscrutinypodcast's Leah Litman to unpack how Trump is testing the limits of presidential power and pushing constitutional guardrails to the brink.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Trump and His Allies Threaten to Defy the Courts Setting up a Constitutional Crisis
**Pod Save America:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw)
*  You just gotta talk Gen Z to him. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=0.0s)]
*  You're like, I can dig these Doja cats. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1.2s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3.56s)]
*  That was horrible. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4.76s)]
*  That was horrible. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=6.3s)]
*  They got good vibes. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=8.48s)]
*  They're just going about it the right way. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=9.8s)]
*  Yeah, throw a no cap on the end of that. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=11.0s)]
*  No cap. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=14.64s)]
*  I'm Jon Favreau. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=15.76s)]
*  I'm Jon Lovett. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=16.6s)]
*  I'm Tommy Vitor. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=17.44s)]
*  On today's show, Donald Trump and JD Vance [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=18.26s)]
*  hinted over the weekend that they may defy the courts [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  after a few federal judges have started [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=23.12s)]
*  to put the brakes on Elon Musk's hostile takeover [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=24.8s)]
*  of the federal government. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=27.6s)]
*  We'll talk about the brewing constitutional crisis [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=29.119999999999997s)]
*  in a bit, and I'll dig in on the legal issues later [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=31.48s)]
*  in the show with strict scrutiny's Leo Littman, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=34.4s)]
*  who joins us. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=36.8s)]
*  We'll also talk about how Elon's wrecking ball [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=38.0s)]
*  is putting everything from cancer research [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=39.76s)]
*  to consumer protection at risk, so much so [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=41.72s)]
*  that even some Republicans are starting to speak up [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=45.0s)]
*  just a little bit. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=47.92s)]
*  The peep. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=49.28s)]
*  Just a peep. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  And in case you were wondering whether Trump [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=51.599999999999994s)]
*  and his family are still shameless grifters, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=53.4s)]
*  it now looks like they've made $100 million [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=55.78s)]
*  in trading fees on the Trump meme coin, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=58.52s)]
*  while a lot of investors got screwed. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=60.760000000000005s)]
*  But are they happy? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=63.080000000000005s)]
*  It seems like it, honestly. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=64.8s)]
*  Yeah, they do seem pretty happy. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  They seem pretty psyched. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=67.08s)]
*  They seem pretty happy. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=67.92s)]
*  We are recording this the Monday after what used [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=68.76s)]
*  to be known as Super Bowl Sunday, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  but will henceforth be known as something else entirely, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=73.08s)]
*  thanks to our new king and savior. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=77.04s)]
*  Here's what was heard aboard Air Force One [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=79.08s)]
*  en route to the big game in New Orleans. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=80.82000000000001s)]
*  Air Force One is currently in international waters, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  the first time in history, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=85.56s)]
*  flying over the recently renamed Gulf of America. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=86.84s)]
*  This is a proclamation declaring today, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=90.44s)]
*  February 9th, 2015, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=93.0s)]
*  it's the first ever Gulf of America day. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=95.04s)]
*  And we're flying right over it right now. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=98.36s)]
*  So we thought this would be appropriate. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=100.92s)]
*  Even bigger than the Super Bowl. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  This is a big day. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  Now, I love the people of Canada. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=107.4s)]
*  We have a great relationship. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=108.76s)]
*  But if they became our 51st state, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=110.72s)]
*  it'd be the greatest thing they could ever do. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=113.48s)]
*  It would be unbelievable. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=115.84s)]
*  It would be a cherished state. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=116.68s)]
*  Because without the US, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  Canada really doesn't have a country. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=119.52000000000001s)]
*  And if we say we want our cars to be made in Detroit, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=121.72s)]
*  with a stroke of a pen, I can do that. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=125.28s)]
*  Other things in addition to that, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  would not allow Canada to be a viable country. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=129.6s)]
*  There's a light over the United States. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=133.48000000000002s)]
*  People are happy. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=136.0s)]
*  They're more confident. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=139.2s)]
*  The approval ratings for this country [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=140.88s)]
*  have gone through the sky. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=144.32s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=146.08s)]
*  The light, the light over the United States? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=146.92s)]
*  American people are taking solid shits. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=148.56s)]
*  They're sleeping through the night. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=150.6s)]
*  Where to begin? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=153.0s)]
*  Where to begin, guys? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=153.88s)]
*  I did find it notable that Trump was somehow able [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=155.8s)]
*  to insert himself at the center [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=158.12s)]
*  of one of America's last [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=160.88s)]
*  and certainly biggest monocultural moments. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=162.28s)]
*  He sat down for an interview with Fox News' Brett Baer, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=165.48s)]
*  part of which aired before the game. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=168.04s)]
*  He also became the first sitting president [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  to attend the Super Bowl, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=171.28s)]
*  where he was cheered on his way in [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=173.04s)]
*  and left before the second half. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=174.56s)]
*  What did you guys make of him going [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=177.28s)]
*  and basically just being on our screens [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=178.67999999999998s)]
*  and in our faces even more than he was [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=182.04s)]
*  during the first turn? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=185.48s)]
*  God, so annoying. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=187.16s)]
*  It's just so annoying. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=188.12s)]
*  Just give me my Super Bowl. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=189.44s)]
*  By the way, was that the Air Force One pilot [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=190.48s)]
*  doing that announcement? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=192.12s)]
*  So we're getting a uniform member of the US military [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=193.28s)]
*  in on your political announcement [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  about the Gulf of America? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  Check out this Norm's fag. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=200.39999999999998s)]
*  I mean, I mean, Apple, Google are changing the name. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=201.4s)]
*  It's all over the place. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=208.4s)]
*  It's an even, as he said, it's an even bigger deal [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=209.84s)]
*  than the Super Bowl. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=212.16s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=213.08s)]
*  No one, everyone thinks this is stupid. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  This is, of all the shit that, like the polls. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=216.44s)]
*  It's not popular. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=218.68s)]
*  Which surprised me. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=219.8s)]
*  I thought people would be like, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=220.84s)]
*  yeah, Gulf of America, cool. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=221.68s)]
*  But it turns out even American voters, smarter than that. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=223.36s)]
*  I will say though, if I were to think of the places [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=226.68s)]
*  that would like it the most, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=228.96s)]
*  it would be that ring of kind of red America [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  that runs from like Clearwater, Florida, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=233.48s)]
*  through the Panhandle, down on the Texas. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=236.16s)]
*  Greater Tampa. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=240.44s)]
*  Yeah, Greater Tampa for sure. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=241.28s)]
*  I'd love to know whoever thought of that [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=243.0s)]
*  before this became a thing with Trump. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=245.51999999999998s)]
*  You know, like I'd love to know the, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=247.28s)]
*  someone should do with the history, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=249.07999999999998s)]
*  an oral history of how Gulf of Mexico [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=250.64s)]
*  became Gulf of America in a Trump proposal. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=252.84s)]
*  We gotta get that person and the guy who told Seale [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=255.64s)]
*  to become an anthropomorphic singing Seale [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=259.28s)]
*  singing about Mountain Dew and we send them both a gimme. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=262.47999999999996s)]
*  That was maybe, it was definitely number one for a while, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=265.08s)]
*  that song in 1994, 93, 94. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=268.71999999999997s)]
*  I can't remember exactly which year. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  Kissin' Marouss by Kissin' Marouss. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=273.0s)]
*  I was in eighth grade, so I think it was 94, 95. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=273.84s)]
*  It was associated with Batman Forever? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=275.67999999999995s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=277.44s)]
*  Yes, Batman Forever. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=278.28s)]
*  And then. That's how I know it. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=279.11999999999995s)]
*  Then all these years later, 30 years later, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=280.47999999999996s)]
*  30 years later, he's a Seale. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=283.84s)]
*  That made me a communist on the spot. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=286.35999999999996s)]
*  I haven't consumed the ads. That was it for capitalism. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=288.28s)]
*  I was making a delicious orange cake [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=289.88s)]
*  based on a recipe by Nigella Lawson. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=292.52s)]
*  And then I got a text from my father saying, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=294.79999999999995s)]
*  what is this? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=297.15999999999997s)]
*  Which led me to believe that the halftime show had begun. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=298.35999999999996s)]
*  So I did turn that on. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=301.03999999999996s)]
*  And then I went back once the oranges were done steeping [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=303.4s)]
*  to making my cake. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=307.88s)]
*  That's what I did. Dad's a great guy. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=308.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, there were a few questions from parents in our home. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=310.44s)]
*  Is there gonna be another Act Two? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=313.76s)]
*  Is this just, is it just, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=315.44s)]
*  this guy? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=318.96s)]
*  Anyway, I really might thought about, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=319.8s)]
*  first of all, Trump likes to flood the zone [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=322.8s)]
*  and he's out there all the time and that's helpful. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=325.32s)]
*  And everyone's made that point. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=327.0s)]
*  And I do think it's a lesson for Democrats going forward [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=327.96s)]
*  who are running for president. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=331.16s)]
*  But he really does seem this time around, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=332.44s)]
*  like he is more of a king in like the ceremonial sense. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=334.4s)]
*  And like, Elon now is the prime minister [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=339.12s)]
*  just doing all the work. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=341.56s)]
*  And Trump is just, he's just posting, talking. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=343.04s)]
*  He's like a little more relaxed. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=345.32s)]
*  He's holding court, he's hosting. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=348.12s)]
*  You always say he's hosting. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=349.72s)]
*  He's having a good time. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=350.56s)]
*  And then like, meanwhile, Elon's just running around [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=351.40000000000003s)]
*  breaking the entire federal government, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=353.12s)]
*  eliminating services for people. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=354.56s)]
*  Yeah, he's free. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=356.12s)]
*  I'm not saying it's the worst model by the way. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=357.76000000000005s)]
*  Well, for like next time, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=359.72s)]
*  like I would like to have a democratic president [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=361.16s)]
*  maybe next time who is out there all the time [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=362.88s)]
*  and just talking to the country the whole time. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=365.76000000000005s)]
*  And then there's a whole bunch of people doing the work. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=367.64000000000004s)]
*  So we are still very much in the honeymoon phase. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=369.24s)]
*  And I think this is really effective for a couple of reasons. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=372.28000000000003s)]
*  I think it was a point that Dan made in that conversation [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=374.28000000000003s)]
*  was that Trump paid for being compared with Ben Smith, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=375.84s)]
*  which is a great episode people should check out. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=380.08s)]
*  But Trump paid for being compared to Obama. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=381.4s)]
*  He's now benefiting from being compared to Joe Biden, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=383.52s)]
*  being out there more and active. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=386.28s)]
*  And we'll get into the politics [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=388.0s)]
*  of all these different moves and what people are knowing, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=389.0s)]
*  what people know is happening, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=390.84s)]
*  what people don't know is happening. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=391.76s)]
*  But fundamentally, he looks extremely active. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=392.71999999999997s)]
*  He's everywhere. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=395.4s)]
*  He's doing things. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=396.23999999999995s)]
*  He seems dynamic. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=397.05999999999995s)]
*  He seems like he's having fun [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=398.44s)]
*  because I think actually for the first time as president, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=399.59999999999997s)]
*  he is genuinely having fun [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=401.91999999999996s)]
*  because he doesn't feel bound by any of the advisors [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=403.32s)]
*  who are telling him the rules [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=405.72s)]
*  that he didn't care about in the first place. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=406.76000000000005s)]
*  But let's see what happens when there's two ways [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=408.8s)]
*  in which this eventually has to, I think, give. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=412.28000000000003s)]
*  One, at a certain point, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=414.08000000000004s)]
*  they won't be able to keep up with their own pace. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=416.84000000000003s)]
*  I'm sure they're thrilled with themselves [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=418.64000000000004s)]
*  that the press can't keep up and the Democrats can't keep up. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=419.96000000000004s)]
*  They can't keep up with this. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=422.28000000000003s)]
*  That's the first. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=423.38000000000005s)]
*  And the second is, he called off that first round of tariffs. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=424.22s)]
*  We are still, he is still able to deny [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=428.76000000000005s)]
*  that he is responsible for a plane crashing, right? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=433.24s)]
*  Even as he's getting rid of air traffic, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=436.12s)]
*  controller boards, whatever. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=438.72s)]
*  So let's see what happens when there start to be [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=440.12s)]
*  consequences for governing or consequences of just reality [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=441.88s)]
*  and the crises that happened to any president, right? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=445.24s)]
*  So like, let's talk about a comparison [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=447.28000000000003s)]
*  with Obama for a second though. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=448.98s)]
*  I watched this and I thought, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=450.40000000000003s)]
*  why couldn't we have gone to stuff? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=452.76s)]
*  Every time Obama wanted to do something cool, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=454.52000000000004s)]
*  we were told it was a security risk [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=456.08000000000004s)]
*  or it was gonna be inconvenience people. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=457.62s)]
*  And I would just ask everyone to Google Obama [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=459.2s)]
*  and date night. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=461.76000000000005s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=462.8s)]
*  2009, Obama and Michelle, they get on the plane, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=464.0s)]
*  they fly to New York, they go to dinner, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=466.28000000000003s)]
*  and they go to a show. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=467.48s)]
*  Fox News and all the conservative media outlets [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=468.6s)]
*  went insane for weeks about what they did, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=471.6s)]
*  whether it was out of touch, the cost to taxpayers. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=475.24s)]
*  I would love to know how much it costs [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=478.04s)]
*  to pack up Air Force One, fly to New Orleans, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=480.6s)]
*  rename a body of water, and then leave it halftime. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=483.72s)]
*  But that's not part of the conversation [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=488.20000000000005s)]
*  because of this massive conservative bias [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=489.78s)]
*  that Fox put on the game and they interviewed Trump before. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=492.09999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't know. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=495.4s)]
*  I just think he's, forget about comparing him [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=498.65999999999997s)]
*  to either Biden or Obama, just aside from that, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=501.14s)]
*  which are all good comparisons, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=503.53999999999996s)]
*  just compare it to himself in the first term, right? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=505.21999999999997s)]
*  Which is, I am wrestling with the fact that we, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=507.46s)]
*  he seems to be having more fun and is in more places [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=509.73999999999995s)]
*  and is more culturally accepted and is part of, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=512.04s)]
*  right, Fox News is always gonna attack everything [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=517.92s)]
*  that a Democratic president does for sure, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=520.1999999999999s)]
*  but just people who don't tune into Fox [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=522.16s)]
*  or the more liberal parts of the media [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=524.52s)]
*  but are just normies in the country. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=526.4399999999999s)]
*  You see the Super Bowl and there's Brad Pitt [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=528.64s)]
*  and there's Taylor Swift and there's New Orleans [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=531.5999999999999s)]
*  and then there's Donald Trump and he's just there [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=535.9599999999999s)]
*  and he's part of it with everyone else. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=537.92s)]
*  And it's also yet, compared to the first term, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=539.5s)]
*  much more dangerous and everything he's doing [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=541.88s)]
*  is much more lawless [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=544.16s)]
*  and there are much more consequences [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=545.8399999999999s)]
*  and it just seems there is this sort of disconnect [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=547.4s)]
*  between how he is in the second term [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=550.1999999999999s)]
*  and how he appears and how he's being received [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=552.92s)]
*  and what is actually happening, though I will say that. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=554.88s)]
*  I think he always would have been welcome in New Orleans [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=556.88s)]
*  at a Super Bowl, to be honest, in the first term. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=558.4s)]
*  Oh yeah, of course. Just in terms of culturally [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=560.64s)]
*  and people liking him and stuff like that. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=562.04s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=563.4799999999999s)]
*  But I'm just saying, like it was, I don't know. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=564.3199999999999s)]
*  If he was there the first term, there would have been some, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=566.16s)]
*  I mean, there were companies boycotting stuff. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=567.7199999999999s)]
*  There was a whole different scene there. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=569.64s)]
*  It was just, it was very, very different. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=571.04s)]
*  There's a way in which he is right now, like ascendant [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=572.3599999999999s)]
*  and feeling strong and that crowd feels happy to cheer him [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=575.0s)]
*  and then boo Taylor Swift and that everybody knows [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=581.48s)]
*  that that's what's gonna happen [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=584.48s)]
*  and that's what we're gonna do together [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=585.76s)]
*  and that's part of the fun. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=587.04s)]
*  But they booed her because she's dating Travis Kelce [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=587.88s)]
*  and it's half Eagles fan, you know what I mean? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=590.0s)]
*  Everyone making the comparison, it's like, come on, guys. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=591.72s)]
*  They're just bitter Eagles fans. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=594.28s)]
*  They're everywhere. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=596.16s)]
*  They've done way worse to like Santa Claus. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=597.0s)]
*  They throw batteries. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=598.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=600.08s)]
*  He used to get booed more itself earlier. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=600.92s)]
*  He used to get booed. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=602.84s)]
*  He was one of the most unpopular presidents [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=603.68s)]
*  in American history. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=605.16s)]
*  I mean, he was booed everywhere he went. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=606.0s)]
*  He was booed at tons of games. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=607.04s)]
*  Yeah, but I do think, I think like, look, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=608.12s)]
*  at this time in Joe Biden's first year, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=610.76s)]
*  it was like 60% approval and his staff was like pushing [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=613.2399999999999s)]
*  around and that he was the second coming of FDR. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=616.7199999999999s)]
*  And it was like that was taken, you know, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=618.92s)]
*  somewhat seriously by various outlets, right? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=620.9799999999999s)]
*  So that's just, I mean, it's true, you know? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=624.0799999999999s)]
*  And when we were sitting there like Joe Biden's doing great. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=625.4s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=627.8s)]
*  So I guess we'll see. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=628.64s)]
*  And he was, and Joe Biden was in the CA box, I think. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=629.4599999999999s)]
*  He was in the CA box, yeah. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=631.3599999999999s)]
*  So we heard Trump once again talking about making Canada [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=634.12s)]
*  our 51st state, though every time he brings this up, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=636.3599999999999s)]
*  it sounds like it started from like joke [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=639.28s)]
*  to maybe he's serious. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=642.7199999999999s)]
*  So that one that we just heard, that sounds like a threat. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=644.04s)]
*  I mean, that was, it's good for them to do this, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=646.9599999999999s)]
*  but also they wouldn't have a country without America. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=650.2399999999999s)]
*  And with one stroke of the pen, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=653.04s)]
*  I could make sure the cars are made in Detroit, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=654.18s)]
*  which I didn't, I mean. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=656.0s)]
*  What is he, is he in Mexico and mainland? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=656.8399999999999s)]
*  What is he talking about? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=658.28s)]
*  Tommy, how are our poor Canadian friends taking all of this? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=659.12s)]
*  They don't like it. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=661.88s)]
*  There was a YouGov poll. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=664.12s)]
*  77% of Canadians oppose Canada [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=664.9599999999999s)]
*  becoming a part of the United States. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=666.92s)]
*  Trump also keeps claiming that the US is subsidizing Canada, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=669.1999999999999s)]
*  which he just doesn't understand what a trade imbalance is. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=672.4599999999999s)]
*  Like we buy a lot of oil from Canada, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=674.76s)]
*  thus we buy more of their stuff than they buy of our stuff. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=677.48s)]
*  But it is really pissing people off up there. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=680.28s)]
*  I mean, there was a sketch on a sketch comedy show in Canada [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=682.02s)]
*  where you had two guys at a grocery store [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=685.16s)]
*  and they were talking about what products to buy [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=686.92s)]
*  and one guy keeps scolding the other [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=688.3199999999999s)]
*  for buying American things and replacing it with, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=689.92s)]
*  the joke is that they're shittier, inferior Canadian versions [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=692.88s)]
*  of whatever it is, even maple syrup. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=695.52s)]
*  And it's pretty funny, but it went super viral. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=697.28s)]
*  And then I was talking to a Canadian friend today who said. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=699.4s)]
*  Sketch comedy in Canada, what's that like? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=701.24s)]
*  Sharp comedy? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=702.64s)]
*  Do we like sketch comedy? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=703.84s)]
*  Oh, they're famously good. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=704.68s)]
*  Yeah, we owe a lot of our Canada, we stole it from them. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=706.32s)]
*  That's one of our biggest imports. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=710.2s)]
*  What was the famous one? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=711.4399999999999s)]
*  This is killing me. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=714.16s)]
*  New Kids in the Hall came from Canada. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=715.2s)]
*  But a ton of like Jim Carrey, a ton of SNL people, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=717.28s)]
*  everybody's from Canada. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=720.1s)]
*  Yeah, but on top of that, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=720.94s)]
*  there was that one clip of Canadians booing [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=723.2399999999999s)]
*  the national anthem at like a hockey game that went viral. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=725.8399999999999s)]
*  Apparently that's happening over and over and over again [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=728.92s)]
*  at NBA games, NHL games, et cetera. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=731.3199999999999s)]
*  So I don't know, I do also think you have to view this [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=733.3199999999999s)]
*  in the context of like last week he announced [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=735.28s)]
*  that we're gonna annex Ethnically Cleanse [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=738.3199999999999s)]
*  and then occupy Gaza. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=740.2399999999999s)]
*  We're picking fights with Denmark over Greenland, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=741.9599999999999s)]
*  there's the Panama thing. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=744.28s)]
*  So like whether or not he's serious, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=745.4399999999999s)]
*  he's just pissing everybody off. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=746.7199999999999s)]
*  And we didn't play it because there was just [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=747.88s)]
*  too much sound to play, but Gaza's another example [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=749.2399999999999s)]
*  where he has the press conference, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=753.4399999999999s)]
*  says that they wanna own Gaza, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=755.16s)]
*  doesn't rule out sending troops. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=757.88s)]
*  The next day, he walks back the troops, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=759.4s)]
*  the White House tries to walk the thing back. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=762.28s)]
*  Then he gets asked about it on the plane [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=763.96s)]
*  on the way to the Super Bowl and he's like, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=765.12s)]
*  own it, like owning a resort. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=766.72s)]
*  Like we're gonna own it and develop it. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=768.72s)]
*  Like he just, he doubled down on the Gaza thing. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=770.84s)]
*  It is ethnic cleansing. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=773.6s)]
*  Two million people live there. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=774.4399999999999s)]
*  He wants to push them out and steal their land. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=775.64s)]
*  That is illegal. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=777.84s)]
*  Also on the Canada thing, I heard, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=779.0s)]
*  I saw a piece that last week Trudeau was caught [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=781.48s)]
*  on a hut mic telling people that like, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=783.9200000000001s)]
*  telling people that like Trump is serious about Canada [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=787.9200000000001s)]
*  and then he thinks that Trump wants their minerals. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=789.9200000000001s)]
*  Their minerals. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=793.08s)]
*  What are we doing? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=793.9200000000001s)]
*  Are we like a feudal lord now? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=795.32s)]
*  What are we doing? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=798.08s)]
*  It's really hard to, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=798.9200000000001s)]
*  it's like hard to think about how to talk about this. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=800.2800000000001s)]
*  I saw Tim Miller make this point over the weekend. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=801.96s)]
*  I thought it was a good one. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=804.5200000000001s)]
*  Because he pointed out that [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=806.2s)]
*  Trump talking about Gaza in this way, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=808.32s)]
*  I assume Trump talking about Canada in this way, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=810.28s)]
*  it's breaking through, right? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=811.92s)]
*  It's the kind of thing that gets beyond [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=813.08s)]
*  where conversations around USAID and NIH grants and. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=815.0s)]
*  I mean, I would hope so. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=820.12s)]
*  Yeah, well. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=821.08s)]
*  The president of the United States talks about [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=821.92s)]
*  annexing the country to the north, yeah. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=823.44s)]
*  But like, so, but then like you'll sometimes see [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=825.8s)]
*  from Democrats, like this is a distraction, right? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=828.16s)]
*  And like, I agree, right? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=830.96s)]
*  Ultimately, like if this is just part of Trump's [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=832.88s)]
*  kind of malign trade war to kind of bully Canada [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=836.6800000000001s)]
*  into accepting certain terms, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=840.8399999999999s)]
*  like it is in some sense a distraction. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=841.68s)]
*  But I do think it's worth just like taking a beat [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=843.48s)]
*  and saying, well, so everyone gets to find out about it. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=845.64s)]
*  We don't address it because it's a distraction. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=849.3199999999999s)]
*  And so then all the culturally relevant conversations [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=852.12s)]

*  beyond like. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=857.92s)]
*  Nah, distraction. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=858.76s)]
*  Distraction, well it's like. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=860.4s)]
*  That's what we're saying when everyone's like, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=861.24s)]
*  what is this Gulf of America Canada saying? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=862.5999999999999s)]
*  It's a distraction. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=864.4399999999999s)]
*  Distraction from what? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=865.28s)]
*  Distraction from what? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=866.12s)]
*  Won't help egg prices come down. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=866.9599999999999s)]
*  Right, yeah, exactly. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=867.8s)]
*  Like it's hard. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=868.64s)]
*  It's hard to deal with and it's meant to be. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=870.76s)]
*  But the answers that we seem to offer most often [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=873.72s)]
*  are like distraction, boy, this is crazy, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=877.04s)]
*  and constitutional crisis. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=879.96s)]
*  As if like if you add the word constitutional, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=881.76s)]
*  it like unlocks a new set of like controls, I don't know. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=883.76s)]
*  But I do think it's worth just being like, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=887.68s)]
*  hey, like we really benefit from the fact [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=888.84s)]
*  that the world's largest border is safe [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=891.88s)]
*  and that there aren't skirmishes between us [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=894.4s)]
*  the way there are in the Himalayas [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=897.16s)]
*  between China and India. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=899.04s)]
*  Or Europe. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=900.24s)]
*  Or Europe. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=901.0799999999999s)]
*  Russia and Ukraine. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=901.92s)]
*  We benefit a lot, right, that France and Germany [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=902.74s)]
*  aren't building trenches as often as they used to. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=904.8s)]
*  Or like even more basic than that, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=907.7199999999999s)]
*  Canada doesn't want to be the 51st state, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=911.64s)]
*  it's not popular, no one there wants to join [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=913.64s)]
*  the United States, I thought that as the United States, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=915.68s)]
*  we believed that people get to determine [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=918.6s)]
*  how they are governed, right? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=920.9599999999999s)]
*  That seems to be a fundamental value in the United States. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=922.48s)]
*  So what are we talking about? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=924.92s)]
*  And it is true. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=926.1999999999999s)]
*  And it is true that there's nothing in the Constitution [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=927.92s)]
*  that requires people want to become a state [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=929.92s)]
*  before we make them one. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=931.8399999999999s)]
*  But it's just sort of the way it's often, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=933.0s)]
*  at least at its best, been done. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=934.5999999999999s)]
*  Core values as a nation, right. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=936.16s)]
*  But the other piece of this too is it's like, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=938.0799999999999s)]
*  I feel like what's under assault is this idea of like, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=941.16s)]
*  there's a stability premium we pay, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=944.76s)]
*  and it's expensive in a lot of different ways, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=946.8399999999999s)]
*  but we get a lot for it, right? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=949.12s)]
*  It's like, we have like an America premium, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=950.88s)]
*  and for America premium, you don't have to worry [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=953.24s)]
*  about a war with Canada, and you can kind of trust [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=954.96s)]
*  that there aren't gonna be a 19-year-old political [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=957.6800000000001s)]
*  apparatchik in the payment system, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=959.48s)]
*  and you know that there's some kind of divide [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=961.2800000000001s)]
*  between the military and law enforcement [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=962.96s)]
*  and the political appointees of the government, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=965.0400000000001s)]
*  even if we've not always honored that. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=966.6800000000001s)]
*  And like, we can have an extremely trusting relationship [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=969.0400000000001s)]
*  which creates a lot of economic benefits for everybody. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=974.0400000000001s)]
*  And now we have these doofuses running around [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=977.48s)]
*  the government being like, what are we paying for? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=979.5600000000001s)]
*  Why are we doing this? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=981.5600000000001s)]
*  What is the value of all this? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=982.44s)]
*  And our two options right now are to convince people [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=983.92s)]
*  that the benefits of kind of common sense and stability [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=986.72s)]
*  are worth it, even though you don't feel the pain, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=989.36s)]
*  or allowing these guys to rip things to pieces so terribly [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=991.4399999999999s)]
*  that we start to experience what America, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=994.8s)]
*  how bad America could get to prove to everybody, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=997.16s)]
*  I guess, that we were right the whole time [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=999.64s)]
*  as we slowly claw our way back. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1001.4s)]
*  Believe me, I've been thinking about a third option, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1003.52s)]
*  and I don't know if we have it. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1005.24s)]
*  Important correction, Big Balls, Mr. Balls, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1007.0s)]
*  got a job at the State Department, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1009.68s)]
*  so he's no longer a treasury. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1010.92s)]
*  This is the Doge, 19-year-old. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1012.04s)]
*  I think they threw him a goodbye party [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1014.32s)]
*  at the treasury, at the systems office. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1016.04s)]
*  Yeah, hey, take a couple of these social security checks [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1018.16s)]
*  with you, for all your service. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1020.64s)]
*  Which I imagine being the severance office. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1022.16s)]
*  The other thing to Tommy's point, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1024.1200000000001s)]
*  it's like severance, just turn them off. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1026.04s)]
*  Just four people there, and then suddenly, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1028.08s)]
*  well, I know Big Balls is different than the other one. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1029.84s)]
*  Everyone know that, right? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1033.64s)]
*  The Big Balls was the one who was fired [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1034.48s)]
*  for leaking information. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1036.2s)]
*  He's not the racist. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1037.04s)]
*  All Doge bros look the same to you. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1037.88s)]
*  But I was also just sort of taking a moment [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1039.68s)]
*  to think about it. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1044.12s)]
*  It's like, okay, what is he complaining about exactly? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1044.96s)]
*  To Tommy's point, we actually, if you take out oil, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1047.12s)]
*  we don't have a trade deficit with Canada. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1050.12s)]
*  They buy a ton of stuff from us. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1051.96s)]
*  We get more out of it than they do. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1053.32s)]
*  They are our biggest export partner, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1054.8799999999999s)]
*  which means that they are our biggest customer. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1056.44s)]
*  17%, 70% of everything the US sells around the world, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1058.2s)]
*  we sell to Canada. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1062.36s)]
*  They are, and no, I'm glad we've moved beyond a society [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1063.52s)]
*  that believes the customer is always right, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1066.76s)]
*  but as a rule, you don't fucking try it out. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1068.36s)]
*  You don't poke your biggest customer in the eye [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1071.6s)]
*  over and over again. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1073.9199999999998s)]
*  It's just fucking stupid. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1074.76s)]
*  Well, now we'll see what happens [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1075.76s)]
*  because some real news from Trump was the announcement [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1076.84s)]
*  that he's putting 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1078.56s)]
*  including from Canada and Mexico. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1081.48s)]
*  So he did this in his first term. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1083.8s)]
*  Trump announced similar steel and aluminum tariffs [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1084.9199999999998s)]
*  that were meant to target China, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1087.76s)]
*  but ended up impacting US businesses [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1088.8799999999999s)]
*  that rely on those materials, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1090.56s)]
*  whether they get them from other countries or not. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1091.9599999999998s)]
*  Trump later carved out exemptions to the tariffs [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1094.08s)]
*  for the rest of his term, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1096.24s)]
*  and Biden rolled them back even more when he got into office. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1097.52s)]
*  The tariffs reportedly just went into effect [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1100.08s)]
*  right before we started recording. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1102.1599999999999s)]
*  It's Monday afternoon, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1103.56s)]
*  and apparently there are no exemptions this time. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1105.0s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1107.96s)]
*  It seems like these are not just a negotiating tactic [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1109.36s)]
*  and it's real since they have now been levied, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1114.3999999999999s)]
*  just like the China ones. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1116.72s)]
*  Hard for the world to call a meeting. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1117.56s)]
*  It's all good together. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1122.2s)]
*  It's good on a Zoom. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1123.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's a negotiating position, but it is real. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1123.8799999999999s)]
*  I think it's just both. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1126.6s)]
*  Trump has just shown us that he wants to tariff first, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1127.96s)]
*  ask questions later. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1131.08s)]
*  I mean, interestingly- [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1132.2s)]
*  That's good, Tommy. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1134.08s)]
*  The US stock market was up on Monday, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1134.92s)]
*  so Wall Street is kind of brushing it off. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1138.44s)]
*  They were like European steel producers that took a hit, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1140.44s)]
*  but I don't know, it's weird how the economic system [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1145.48s)]
*  is just kind of taking the same- [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1149.32s)]
*  I have the same reaction to it. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1151.64s)]
*  Because the economic, it's like, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1153.08s)]
*  if you're, probably though, it's gonna be felt by people [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1154.88s)]
*  who are in these industries, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1158.1599999999999s)]
*  and then consumers will pay higher prices [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1159.0s)]
*  for things that we buy that are made from steel and aluminum [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1162.0s)]
*  that are not made in the United States. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1164.3999999999999s)]
*  But even domestic steel producers, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1165.52s)]
*  they didn't really increase their output that much [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1167.0s)]
*  the first time around in the first administration [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1168.8799999999999s)]
*  after the tariffs were put in place on imports. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1170.6799999999998s)]
*  So it's not benefiting anybody. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1172.72s)]
*  Right, and some of them were interviewed [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1174.96s)]
*  and they were like, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1176.76s)]
*  I liked his protectionist instincts, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1177.6s)]
*  but the first time around, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1179.8799999999999s)]
*  it just ended up making everything more expensive. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1181.48s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, no kidding. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1184.36s)]
*  It turns out people's views on Trump's tariffs [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1186.32s)]
*  are mixed at best. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1188.04s)]
*  A new poll from CBS over the weekend [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1189.6399999999999s)]
*  about Trump's first few weeks in office [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1191.28s)]
*  show a slight majority favors tariffs on goods from China, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1193.0s)]
*  but even bigger majorities oppose tariffs on goods [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1197.52s)]
*  from Mexico, Canada, and Europe. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1200.3999999999999s)]
*  Maybe because most Americans see those countries [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1203.2s)]
*  as our allies. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1205.72s)]
*  The poll also shows that 66% of voters [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1207.24s)]
*  think that Trump is not focusing enough on lowering prices, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1210.32s)]
*  though his approval rating is at 53%, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1213.52s)]
*  with around two thirds of voters [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1217.28s)]
*  describing the president as tough, energetic, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1219.3999999999999s)]
*  focused, and effective. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1222.12s)]
*  What do you guys make of the poll? [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1224.24s)]
*  And especially the discrepancy between how people feel [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1225.76s)]
*  about Trump's economic agenda [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1229.12s)]
*  and his focus on lowering prices [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1231.08s)]
*  and how they feel about Trump's presidency overall. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1233.16s)]
*  I mean, I think it reflects a lot of what Lovett [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1236.2s)]
*  was getting at earlier, which is, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1239.0s)]
*  first of all, presidents tend to have a honeymoon period, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1240.24s)]
*  and that's just kind of a tough political reality [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1242.28s)]
*  for all of us Democrats [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1244.04s)]
*  to fight this. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1244.88s)]
*  And also, as much as I want to throw [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1246.3600000000001s)]
*  all of Trump's campaign promises in his face, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1248.5200000000002s)]
*  like the price of eggs is not down, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1250.7600000000002s)]
*  you have not ended the war in Ukraine, et cetera, et cetera, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1252.96s)]
*  he said he'd do it in 24 hours, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1255.2800000000002s)]
*  I think most voters get that it was a schtick [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1256.64s)]
*  and they're gonna give him some time [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1259.44s)]
*  to actually get things done. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1260.6000000000001s)]
*  But moreover, they just see him doing stuff. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1263.3200000000002s)]
*  He's active, they might not like all of it, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1267.3200000000002s)]
*  but he's doing things, he's taking action, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1269.72s)]
*  he looks decisive, he's on the TV, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1271.7600000000002s)]
*  he's signing shit and holding it up, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1273.76s)]
*  no one can read what it says. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1275.24s)]
*  But they, I guess, seem to like that so far. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1277.3600000000001s)]
*  And to feel the pain on this stuff, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1280.04s)]
*  it's gonna take some time. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1283.1200000000001s)]
*  The response on should the US annex and occupy Gaza [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1284.24s)]
*  was like 13% in favor, 47 something opposed, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1289.64s)]
*  41% were like, huh? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1294.04s)]
*  Most people were like, what? [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1296.16s)]
*  And I think over time, if he slaps terrorists [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1297.6000000000001s)]
*  on Europe and Canada, if we really do have [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1300.6s)]
*  a military occupation in the Middle East again, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1303.9199999999998s)]
*  people will not like that. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1306.24s)]
*  The Elon stuff also, I think, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1307.3999999999999s)]
*  will not wear that well over time, but it will take time. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1308.52s)]
*  It doesn't wear that well in this poll. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1310.72s)]
*  In this poll, there's a lot of people [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1312.2s)]
*  who are looking at this and saying, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1313.52s)]
*  I would like less or none of him, thank you very much, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1314.52s)]
*  a billionaire interceding and having so much sway [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1317.76s)]
*  over the government, which I also took as a good sign. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1321.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think we have a lot of ideological criticism [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1324.48s)]
*  obviously with what Trump is doing. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1331.08s)]
*  We don't like the way that he's doing it. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1332.48s)]
*  But if you're not thinking about the value of forbearance [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1334.72s)]
*  and the ways in which it has been done in the past [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1340.12s)]
*  and why a government that moved more slowly [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1342.4399999999998s)]
*  and deliberately is ultimately more valuable [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1344.96s)]
*  because over time, we all benefit from the safety [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1347.52s)]
*  and security of that kind of a system. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1350.56s)]
*  Trump is, he is moving so fast. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1352.96s)]
*  They are doing a lot. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1357.36s)]
*  It's not just the perception of it. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1358.68s)]
*  They hit the ground running in a serious way. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1360.44s)]
*  It's like genuinely impressive, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1363.48s)]
*  impressive in a dark and sinister way, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1365.3200000000002s)]
*  but it's nonetheless impressive. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1367.68s)]
*  And if you're turning on the news every day [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1369.0s)]
*  and hearing about all these different things [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1370.2s)]
*  Trump is doing and all the different criticisms [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1371.3200000000002s)]
*  coming out of it, you may not like all of it, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1372.76s)]
*  but like in comparison to how people felt about Joe Biden [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1374.88s)]
*  being basically absent, I imagine for a lot of people, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1378.0400000000002s)]
*  it's a welcome change, even though you're like, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1381.2s)]
*  I didn't want, like I wanted the border under control. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1382.48s)]
*  I wasn't in this for some kind of, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1386.72s)]
*  for cuts that I don't totally understand. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1389.2s)]
*  I was in this to get the economy in better shape [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1391.24s)]
*  and prices under control and to feel like I understood [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1393.04s)]
*  what my president was doing. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1395.32s)]
*  So that, I think it kind of reflects [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1396.32s)]
*  what we've been talking about. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1398.2s)]
*  I think the normies just aren't paying attention [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1399.44s)]
*  and the normies are most of the country. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1403.08s)]
*  And we just had an election where we learned this, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1404.96s)]
*  where despite billions of dollars being spent [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1407.04s)]
*  to get people to pay attention [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1411.64s)]
*  to the 2024 presidential race, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1412.92s)]
*  there was still a good chunk of Americans [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1415.6399999999999s)]
*  that barely paid attention. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1417.6799999999998s)]
*  They tended to vote for Donald Trump. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1418.84s)]
*  The Americans who did pay close attention to the news [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1420.3999999999999s)]
*  tended to vote for Kamala Harris in these polls even, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1422.56s)]
*  like his approval rating among Democrats [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1425.8s)]
*  isn't like especially high, right? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1427.9199999999998s)]
*  Like Democrats are still outraged by Donald Trump. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1429.8799999999999s)]
*  And I think to your point, the energy and he's signing things [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1432.6s)]
*  and he's effect all that, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1436.6799999999998s)]
*  I think that is playing extraordinarily well [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1437.52s)]
*  with the people who voted for him, right? [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1440.1599999999999s)]
*  With most people who voted for him, I think they're excited. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1441.84s)]
*  I think most people in the country [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1443.8799999999999s)]
*  still aren't paying attention. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1444.96s)]
*  And I do think I buy the approval rating at 53% for sure, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1445.92s)]
*  or at least in that neighborhood, right? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1450.5600000000002s)]
*  Like I think these polls are all legitimate. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1452.24s)]
*  I wish pollsters would start asking more questions [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1454.2s)]
*  about like people's views on actions that he's taking [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1456.44s)]
*  or proposals that he's making on some of the cuts [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1461.0s)]
*  that are gonna happen under the Doge regime, all this shit. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1465.48s)]
*  Like I just feel like asking about presidential approval [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1469.3600000000001s)]
*  and what do you think he's like [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1473.8799999999999s)]
*  and is he energetic at this point? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1475.04s)]
*  I just think it's of limited value right now [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1476.52s)]
*  in the first 100 days and that we actually need to, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1478.9199999999998s)]
*  those descriptors of Trump, tough, energetic, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1482.52s)]
*  focused, effective, like yeah, they make sense. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1485.32s)]
*  I get why people would say that about him. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1487.24s)]
*  Like I get why, he's in a honeymoon period, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1488.8s)]
*  it's the beginning of his term. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1491.52s)]
*  Again, Joe Biden had a higher approval ratings [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1492.52s)]
*  at this time too, so it's not super surprising, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1494.44s)]
*  but you kinda gotta dig in [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1496.72s)]
*  because most people aren't paying attention. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1498.96s)]
*  Well, here's the problem though. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1500.3999999999999s)]
*  Most people are never gonna, like, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1501.6s)]
*  Right, they're never gonna pay attention. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1502.68s)]
*  Well, they're gonna pay attention. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1503.96s)]
*  Until they feel effects. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1504.8s)]
*  This is what you were saying. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1505.64s)]
*  Well, this is why I think it's about what happens [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1506.48s)]
*  when people start feeling effects, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1508.48s)]
*  but like I do think we should assume [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1509.68s)]
*  that the way people are consuming Donald Trump right now [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1511.52s)]
*  is not going to change that much [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1514.24s)]
*  until a few months before the midterms, right? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1516.48s)]
*  Or I mean, think back to the first term. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1519.28s)]
*  His lowest approval is January 6th. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1521.8s)]
*  Everyone's like, obviously, of course, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1524.2s)]
*  and tied, maybe even lower in one of them, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1526.0s)]
*  is ACA and tax cuts because in ACA, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1528.52s)]
*  the country was like, oh, we don't like paying attention [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1532.52s)]
*  to the news, but you know what? [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1534.8s)]
*  You might lose our healthcare. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1535.72s)]
*  And all the other shit that we obsessed about [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1537.04s)]
*  and we talked about on this podcast [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1539.24s)]
*  and everyone else in the media talked about [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1540.68s)]
*  didn't really make that much of a difference [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1543.2s)]
*  in his approval rating, but those things [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1544.8s)]
*  that were gonna affect people actually did. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1546.56s)]
*  So we're waiting for acute moments of focus [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1547.92s)]
*  around big signal political events, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1551.0s)]
*  either crises or legislative moments, fine. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1553.6399999999999s)]
*  But my point is only that day to day, in between those, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1555.92s)]
*  this is the kind of Trump we're going to get, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1559.16s)]
*  a Trump that's kind of everywhere, swamping the news. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1560.9199999999998s)]
*  And we need to be able to figure out [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1562.72s)]
*  how to make an argument during those times [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1564.0s)]
*  because if we're just waiting for things to either get bad [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1565.72s)]
*  or for them to actually try to pass something terrible, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1568.1599999999999s)]
*  we're kind of just yoked to his news cycle. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1569.9599999999998s)]
*  And even the people not paying attention, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1572.56s)]
*  I agree, that's the majority, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1574.1599999999999s)]
*  what they're seeing is Trump at the Super Bowl, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1575.28s)]
*  Trump doing stuff, and they're like, oh, that's cool. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1577.28s)]
*  That looks fun. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1579.24s)]
*  Or they think it's, or I mean, this is, again, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1580.1599999999999s)]
*  the Gulf of America thing just keeps popping up. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1582.6399999999999s)]
*  But that would be stupid. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1584.32s)]
*  Right, like that's something that breaks through [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1585.1599999999999s)]
*  because it's so weird and different [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1586.8799999999999s)]
*  and like a cultural thing. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1589.7199999999998s)]
*  And people are like, oh no, that's stupid. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1591.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, is it salient? [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1592.8s)]
*  Like that's always the question. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1594.28s)]
*  Oh, I'm sure it's not salient. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1595.12s)]
*  It's stupid obviously, but do they care? [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1595.9399999999998s)]
*  Are they like, that's fine, just trolling. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1597.36s)]
*  I'm sure they don't care, but they don't like it. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1598.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, look, I think about that group of people, right? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1600.32s)]
*  Because yes, I think there's Democrats [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1604.24s)]
*  that are inoculated against Trump forever, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1605.84s)]
*  the Republicans that will love him forever. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1607.8s)]
*  There's this group of people, independent people, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1610.56s)]
*  when they see Trump saying Gulf of America, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1612.8799999999999s)]
*  when they see him talking about making Canada a state, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1614.4399999999998s)]
*  maybe they don't like it in the moment, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1616.72s)]
*  but it's also like, it's hard not to imagine [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1619.68s)]
*  the idea of Trump just like out there every day [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1622.04s)]
*  being like a pro-America guy is not like there. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1624.08s)]
*  One last thing that we should, I just, I don't know. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1627.56s)]
*  Before we leave this, like this 66% who think [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1629.76s)]
*  that Trump is not focusing enough on lowering prices, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1633.1200000000001s)]
*  that is a big deal. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1635.96s)]
*  That is a big deal. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1636.8s)]
*  And I wanna note this as well because there was a [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1637.6200000000001s)]
*  long running debate just on our side of the spectrum [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1641.02s)]
*  about is it the economy, is it vibes with voters [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1644.56s)]
*  being concerned about inflation and high prices during Biden. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1647.82s)]
*  There's a lot of people who said, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1650.92s)]
*  oh no, actually the economy is wonderful. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1651.76s)]
*  And the only reason that people think that complaining [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1654.44s)]
*  about prices is because they're either partisan Republicans [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1657.32s)]
*  or the media is fucking up. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1659.56s)]
*  And as soon as Trump wins, oh, it's gonna be different. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1660.82s)]
*  Everyone's gonna be wonderful. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1662.96s)]
*  Well, actually, no, Trump has won and 66% of voters [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1663.84s)]
*  think he's not focusing enough on lower prices [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1667.0s)]
*  and consumer confidence came in last week and it was down. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1668.68s)]
*  So here's what's interesting. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1671.76s)]
*  I think I agree with you. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1672.68s)]
*  I think that that will largely be proven correct [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1673.84s)]
*  that it was like not some media fueled [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1676.04s)]
*  or Republican fueled notion. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1679.6399999999999s)]
*  I think that's probably true. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1680.78s)]
*  Wasn't headlines. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1681.62s)]
*  But there's two, it was not the phrasing of AP headlines. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1682.52s)]
*  But I do think that there is a two step process to this, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1685.02s)]
*  which is Trump is, people are correct. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1687.56s)]
*  It's forget having an impact on product. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1691.0s)]
*  Trump is not focused on it. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1692.6799999999998s)]
*  He's not talking about it all the time. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1693.9399999999998s)]
*  He's not thinking about all the time. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1695.1599999999999s)]
*  He's not addressing it all the time. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1696.12s)]
*  He's actually not doing it the way. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1697.36s)]
*  He's trying to use tariffs as a substitution, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1699.62s)]
*  which is a real fucking thing. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1701.9599999999998s)]
*  And energy. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1703.0s)]
*  Energy is his entire price. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1703.8400000000001s)]
*  Energy, right. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1704.68s)]
*  But when Trump wants to hammer something, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1705.8400000000001s)]
*  he wants to hammer something. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1707.4s)]
*  I think the bigger test is actually [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1708.24s)]
*  when Trump doesn't magically have the ability [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1710.2s)]
*  to lower prices but starts figuring out a way [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1711.96s)]
*  either to blame people or to declare victory, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1713.76s)]
*  then what happens? [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1715.72s)]
*  And I think largely this will be proven [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1717.28s)]
*  to be a serious political problem for him, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1719.48s)]
*  but he has another turn of it. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1721.96s)]
*  Yeah, I think that people's material conditions are still, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1724.8400000000001s)]
*  they still drive a lot of public opinion. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1730.3200000000002s)]
*  Hunter Biden gave all those birds the flu. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1732.24s)]
*  Hunter Biden did it? [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1735.76s)]
*  Hunter Biden did it. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1736.6s)]
*  Really? [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1737.44s)]
*  You didn't read that? [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1738.28s)]
*  Is that a thing? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1739.1s)]
*  It's in the break part. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1739.94s)]
*  No, I'm just kidding. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1740.78s)]
*  You can't surprise us at this point. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1741.6s)]
*  There's nothing that would surprise me. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1742.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1743.76s)]
*  Was that people saying that? [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1744.6s)]
*  He did that? [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1745.44s)]
*  Today's presenting sponsor is Simply Safe Home Security. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1746.28s)]
*  No one wants to imagine their home getting broken into, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1748.56s)]
*  but the scary statistic is that every 26 seconds [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1750.3s)]

*  Yes, that's right. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1928.74s)]

*  Unbelievable. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1947.06s)]
*  Anyway, on Monday afternoon, a federal judge ruled [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1947.8999999999999s)]
*  that the Trump administration hasn't fully complied [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1949.6999999999998s)]
*  with multiple orders to unfreeze federal spending. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1951.98s)]
*  That followed a ruling on Saturday [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1954.62s)]
*  that doge can't access treasury's payment systems. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1956.62s)]
*  Only trained civil servants are allowed. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1959.34s)]
*  Elon and Maga World are furious over this ruling. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1961.94s)]
*  Elon called for the judge to be impeached, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1965.5400000000002s)]
*  also proposed annual elections [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1967.74s)]
*  to eliminate the worst judges. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1969.98s)]
*  I don't know if you know, that's his new thing. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1972.0600000000002s)]
*  But the most alarming reaction, I think, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1974.92s)]
*  came from Vice President JD Vance, who tweeted, quote, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1976.64s)]
*  "'Judges aren't allowed to control [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1979.46s)]
*  "'the executive's legitimate power.'" [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1981.74s)]
*  When Trump was asked about this by Brett Baer [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1983.94s)]
*  during his Fox News interview, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1986.26s)]
*  and then again on Air Force One, here's what he said. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1987.3200000000002s)]
*  19 states attorneys general filed a lawsuit, [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1989.26s)]
*  and early Saturday, a judge agreed with them [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1991.98s)]
*  to restrict Elon Musk and his government efficiency team, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1994.66s)]
*  doge, from accessing treasury department payment [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=1997.8600000000001s)]
*  and data systems. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2001.02s)]
*  They said there was a risk of irreparable harm. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2002.42s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2005.24s)]
*  And does that slow you down on what you want to do? [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2006.22s)]
*  I disagree with it 100%. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2008.34s)]
*  I think it's crazy. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2010.1000000000001s)]
*  And you say you trust him. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2010.94s)]
*  Trust Elon? [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2013.7s)]
*  Oh, he's not gaining anything. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2014.54s)]
*  In fact, I wonder how he can devote the time to it. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2016.26s)]
*  JD Vance said judges aren't allowed [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2019.3s)]
*  to control the executive power. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2021.06s)]
*  What's your take on that? [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2022.3799999999999s)]
*  Well, we're gonna see what happens. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2023.34s)]
*  We have a long way to go, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2024.54s)]
*  and we're talking about fraud, waste, abuse. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2025.6599999999999s)]
*  And when a president can't look for fraud and waste [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2030.96s)]
*  and abuse, we don't have a country anymore. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2033.54s)]
*  So we're very disappointed with the judges [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2035.34s)]
*  that would make such a ruling. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2038.26s)]
*  Small thing there, but when Trump was talking about Elon [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2039.8999999999999s)]
*  and he was like, I don't know where he finds the time [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2043.9199999999998s)]
*  for this. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2045.58s)]
*  It just betrayed, just a hint of, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2046.42s)]
*  Trump always is very good about like, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2049.2200000000003s)]
*  I know where the American people are. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2050.86s)]
*  I know what you're thinking. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2052.26s)]
*  You're like, what's going on with this guy? [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2053.1s)]
*  I gotcha, I gotcha. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2054.46s)]
*  You know where he finds the time? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2055.3s)]
*  Not parenting. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2056.12s)]
*  You gotta have a lot of kids [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2057.42s)]
*  and you see them as little as possible. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2058.7400000000002s)]
*  That's how you free up all your time for doging. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2060.3s)]
*  Not the first dad to stay late at work [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2062.3s)]
*  because he doesn't like his family and won't be the last. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2064.46s)]
*  Trump's also like, I mean, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2067.54s)]
*  there's no bigger poster than Donald Trump. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2069.14s)]
*  And he's probably like, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2071.6s)]
*  this guy is posting even more than I am. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2072.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, he's just in awe. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2074.86s)]
*  He's like, this is magnificent. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2076.7400000000002s)]
*  So I talked to Leah about all the legal implications [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2078.98s)]
*  of this, which you'll all hear in a little bit, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2082.6600000000003s)]
*  but just a little spoiler for you guys. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2085.54s)]
*  Even though judges aren't allowed to control [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2087.94s)]
*  the executive's legitimate power, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2090.2000000000003s)]
*  guess who decides what constitutes [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2093.0s)]
*  the executive's legitimate power? [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2095.1400000000003s)]
*  Well, sure. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2098.02s)]
*  I like had this moment. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2098.86s)]
*  South Africans? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2099.6800000000003s)]
*  I had this moment over the weekend. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2100.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2101.94s)]
*  I had this moment over the weekend [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2102.78s)]
*  where I was just sort of like, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2103.8199999999997s)]
*  I can't believe I have to go back [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2104.8599999999997s)]
*  and try to remember what the fuck [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2107.54s)]
*  Marbury versus Madison was about. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2108.7799999999997s)]
*  I did too. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2110.2599999999998s)]
*  And I was like, what did Andrew Jackson do? [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2111.1s)]
*  I went into chat GPT and I was like. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2113.94s)]
*  Oh, great. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2115.9s)]
*  Fucking great. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2116.94s)]
*  Go to a different oligarch to get your answers [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2118.06s)]
*  to how to fight. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2120.02s)]
*  This oligarch's fucking stolen IP machine [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2121.42s)]
*  is gonna help me figure out the answer [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2125.9s)]
*  how to fight this other oligarch. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2127.06s)]
*  I said this on offline, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2128.44s)]
*  but part of it is Google sucks these days. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2129.2999999999997s)]
*  I know. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2130.8599999999997s)]
*  And so I actually asked you out to be, [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2131.68s)]
*  can you give me a copy of the constitution? [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2132.52s)]
*  I thought that was gonna be faster than Googling it was. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2134.8s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2136.7599999999998s)]
*  I actually read, cause I'm like, all right, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2137.6s)]
*  what does article three actually say? [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2138.94s)]
*  And then I read, yeah, the whole thing. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2140.44s)]
*  It's believe me. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2141.48s)]
*  Robert Byrd over here. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2142.32s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2143.14s)]
*  Robert Byrd. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2143.98s)]
*  Like I am curious what Leah has to think about this, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2145.04s)]
*  but like, and I do think some of this is posturing [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2147.08s)]
*  and some of this is what presidents of all stripes [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2151.4s)]
*  and all administrations have said, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2155.16s)]
*  some version of these courts. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2156.48s)]
*  I am a constitutional officer. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2158.52s)]
*  I have the right to say what I believe [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2160.0s)]
*  the constitution is to be. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2161.4s)]
*  And they are not the sole arbiters [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2162.36s)]
*  of what's in the constitution. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2164.44s)]
*  But to me, like some of this is negotiating, right? [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2165.9s)]
*  They are sending a message to courts to trim their sales [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2169.0s)]
*  and to be mindful that they're not afraid [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2173.04s)]
*  to push it to the limit. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2174.56s)]
*  The point that Liz Cheney made this point, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2175.4s)]
*  several other people made this point, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2177.2400000000002s)]
*  which is you don't just get to ignore court rulings [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2178.36s)]
*  you dislike, you have to appeal them. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2180.2400000000002s)]
*  Now on a lot of issues, that's what they're doing, right? [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2181.94s)]
*  They are appealing them. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2184.4s)]
*  Including this one. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2185.2400000000002s)]
*  Including this one. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2186.06s)]
*  And so they are appealing them. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2186.9s)]
*  They are seeming to have some respect for the process. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2187.88s)]
*  So there are some signs that that is, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2189.92s)]
*  if not fragile, temporary. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2191.52s)]
*  Like different memos from legal officials inside the DOJ [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2193.52s)]
*  and other parts of the administration [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2198.28s)]
*  explaining why this court ruling [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2199.36s)]
*  doesn't need to be followed in certain ways. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2200.6800000000003s)]
*  To me, I like have two broad categories [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2203.04s)]
*  that I'm concerned about. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2204.6800000000003s)]
*  One is they take a signal case, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2206.12s)]
*  they take it all the way to the Supreme Court, [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2208.44s)]
*  Supreme Court rules against them, and they violate it. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2209.7200000000003s)]
*  Either they violate it explicitly [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2211.58s)]
*  or they violate it implicitly [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2213.04s)]
*  by putting some kind of a legal, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2214.64s)]
*  some kind of way of making, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2218.48s)]
*  of claiming to abide by, about actually ignoring it. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2219.84s)]
*  Very worried about that. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2222.8s)]
*  That is terrifying. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2223.68s)]
*  Day to day, what I've been thinking about is, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2224.64s)]
*  you know, Trump is trying to do all this [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2227.88s)]
*  activist shit inside of these agencies. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2229.38s)]
*  That's his prerogative as president, right? [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2231.52s)]
*  To put people in place, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2232.84s)]
*  they're gonna execute what he wants them to do. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2233.68s)]
*  And inside these agencies, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2235.7599999999998s)]
*  they're putting in place Trump loyal lawyers. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2236.74s)]
*  Some of them are gonna be better than others, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2238.96s)]
*  some of them are gonna be more conservative than others. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2240.04s)]
*  Conservative small C. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2242.16s)]
*  And the question is, how much are those lawyers, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2243.76s)]
*  the outside of the spotlight, [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2247.76s)]
*  in the day to day work, grinding work of these agencies, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2249.2000000000003s)]
*  how much are they gonna worry about legal challenges [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2251.3s)]
*  from states, attorneys general, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2253.96s)]
*  from outside advocates and groups, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2256.26s)]
*  from individuals, from employees, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2258.6000000000004s)]
*  how much are they gonna make decisions [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2260.1800000000003s)]
*  the way previous administrations would have, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2261.6800000000003s)]
*  in one way or another, being guided by the fear of lawsuits [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2263.5600000000004s)]
*  because they know practically, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2266.0800000000004s)]
*  they just can't fight everything all the time, all at once. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2267.46s)]
*  They have to make decisions [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2270.0400000000004s)]
*  about where they're gonna push harder [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2271.44s)]
*  and where they're gonna be willing to not take legal risk. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2272.78s)]
*  And what I don't know in watching this right now [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2275.2200000000003s)]
*  is over time, will they become less concerned [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2277.82s)]
*  about those kinds of risks [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2280.78s)]
*  because of rhetoric from JD Vance [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2282.02s)]
*  and because of the actions of the higher level people [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2283.34s)]
*  inside the administration. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2285.82s)]
*  And I think right now we don't know [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2286.76s)]
*  and that's really nerve wracking [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2288.02s)]
*  because that daily check on the power of the administration, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2289.2200000000003s)]
*  that kind of risk aversion of lawyers [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2293.78s)]
*  is really, really, really important. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2296.0600000000004s)]
*  The slightly optimistic version of this, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2298.82s)]
*  and I don't share this view really, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2302.1400000000003s)]
*  is that there was sort of a willful [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2303.82s)]
*  or maybe accidental misreading of what the judge said [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2306.34s)]
*  because it was a little bit sloppily worded [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2309.6200000000003s)]
*  or confusingly worded [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2312.3s)]
*  and some people were interpreting his ruling as saying, [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2313.56s)]
*  even the secretary of the treasury [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2316.78s)]
*  did not have access to the treasury payment system, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2319.06s)]
*  which is like kind of self-evidently ridiculous. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2321.5s)]
*  I think what he actually meant was the treasury secretary [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2323.54s)]
*  could not give unauthorized people access [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2325.66s)]
*  to this payment system within treasury. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2328.3799999999997s)]
*  And you're right, like fight it out in court. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2331.02s)]
*  But I think my takeaway from this, which drove me nuts, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2333.1s)]
*  is that Trump, JD Vance, Elon Musk, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2336.8199999999997s)]
*  even like the far right fringe like Alex Jones, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2340.1s)]
*  it doesn't matter how much power they have, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2343.06s)]
*  they can have the White House, the Congress, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2344.8199999999997s)]
*  the courts, the media, social media, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2345.98s)]
*  they are always the victims [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2347.74s)]
*  and they're always whining [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2348.8999999999996s)]
*  about how they're being attacked and it's unfair [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2350.3799999999997s)]
*  and like going after these judges [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2353.1s)]
*  and it drives me crazy. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2354.82s)]
*  And I'm just hoping that they will rub voters the wrong way [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2356.82s)]
*  just to hear them bitching and moaning all the time. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2360.46s)]
*  I mean, they have vanquished Congress, right? [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2362.6600000000003s)]
*  Congress has given up any kind of resistance [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2365.7000000000003s)]
*  to the president. Truly. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2367.98s)]
*  It's just abdicated power [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2368.82s)]
*  because it's controlled by Republicans [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2369.7400000000002s)]
*  and so they've got Congress. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2371.54s)]
*  And they're feeling pretty good about the country [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2374.06s)]
*  and where public opinion is [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2377.46s)]
*  and I think they have decided that the judiciary [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2378.5800000000004s)]
*  is the last obstacle, the last villain left. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2382.02s)]
*  You missed one which is the media, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2385.06s)]
*  which they now view as an unnecessary, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2386.38s)]
*  it's sort of like a kind of ignorable component. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2388.98s)]
*  Yes, yeah, for sure. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2391.34s)]
*  Just for sadness' sake. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2392.58s)]
*  Right, and some of that is, look, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2393.7s)]
*  the attacks on the media, [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2397.82s)]
*  but some of it is just the Balkanization of the media, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2398.9s)]
*  which we've talked about a million times, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2401.46s)]
*  so yeah, definitely. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2402.46s)]
*  And so- Offensive word. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2404.14s)]
*  Balkanization, shame on you. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2405.9s)]
*  It's Trump's president, it's fine. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2408.2599999999998s)]
*  And so they are going to, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2410.82s)]
*  it's interesting there's two tracks here, right? [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2413.1800000000003s)]
*  There's the legal track where, [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2415.06s)]
*  right now they are trying to come up with an agreement, [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2418.54s)]
*  the defendants and the plaintiffs here [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2421.06s)]
*  and trying to work out who gets access, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2423.98s)]
*  all this and the judge is like, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2426.6200000000003s)]
*  I'll give you till Monday night and you can do that. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2427.5800000000004s)]
*  So it's proceeding along normally, right? [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2429.3s)]
*  But the public relations component of this, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2432.3s)]
*  the messaging component is everyone in Mago World [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2435.1400000000003s)]
*  and Doge World and everything, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2438.1000000000004s)]
*  they're just attacking the shit out of these judges [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2439.3s)]
*  and saying that they're corrupt and they're awful [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2441.7400000000002s)]
*  and Elon Musk being like, we should vote judges out. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2443.6600000000003s)]
*  I mean, it's, so the danger to me is maybe not necessarily [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2446.34s)]
*  in what happens in this individual case, right? [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2449.7000000000003s)]
*  Although maybe it is, but the, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2452.82s)]
*  now we are turning the guns toward the judiciary system [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2455.1000000000004s)]
*  and turning everyone's fire [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2459.02s)]
*  towards the judiciary system on the right. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2460.0600000000004s)]
*  And on the end, like that's where- [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2461.7000000000003s)]
*  I think it's dangerous. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2463.0600000000004s)]
*  I think it's, look, I think there's, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2463.94s)]
*  I mean, judges have been murdered in the past. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2465.78s)]
*  Yeah, I would add, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2467.8199999999997s)]
*  you're less physically scared. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2468.66s)]
*  Romney talked about it. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2469.5s)]
*  They are physically scared, I think that's real. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2470.3399999999997s)]
*  I think that they are being cowed [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2472.02s)]
*  into making more less far-reaching rulings. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2473.42s)]
*  But then you look at Elon, it's just also some of this, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2476.74s)]
*  it's just like, God, the combination of just like [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2478.94s)]
*  the malevolence, but the idiocy, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2481.3799999999997s)]
*  it's like they should be impeached. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2482.7799999999997s)]
*  And it's like, do you know that that word [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2484.1s)]
*  is just to launch a trial? [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2486.42s)]
*  You understand that the Senate won't convict? [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2487.66s)]
*  Have you thought about this? [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2489.7s)]
*  Do you not care? [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2490.54s)]
*  You're just firing off notions in a fit of peak? [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2491.3799999999997s)]
*  Cause these judges will not be removed. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2495.42s)]
*  The Senate, there's no two thirds vote [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2497.06s)]
*  to remove these senators. Willful ignorance. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2498.54s)]
*  He doesn't care. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2499.7400000000002s)]
*  He's so, he's like, I'm smart about rockets and cars. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2500.58s)]
*  And so I must be smart about everything else. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2503.2200000000003s)]
*  And if I don't know about it, who the fuck cares? [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2504.7400000000002s)]
*  If I don't know, it doesn't matter. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2506.58s)]
*  It's not important. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2507.98s)]
*  And actually it shouldn't be important. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2508.82s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2510.26s)]
*  It's embarrassing that you care about that. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2511.1s)]
*  The other, like, there's this back and forth [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2513.54s)]
*  between Elon and Lawrence Summers, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2516.1800000000003s)]
*  who was a treasury secretary, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2519.34s)]
*  among the several treasury secretaries [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2521.78s)]
*  that wrote in the New York Times, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2523.1800000000003s)]
*  declaring that Democrats under siege [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2524.86s)]
*  because of what they're doing. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2526.46s)]
*  Institutional move of the week. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2527.98s)]
*  And then, yeah, sure. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2529.94s)]
*  And then like institutions, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2531.18s)]
*  defending institutions inside of creaking institutions. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2532.18s)]
*  But the, yeah, institutions and institutions, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2534.5s)]
*  getting institutions. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2538.3s)]
*  But- [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2540.7s)]
*  The Atlantic was like, damn, we should have got that by. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2541.54s)]
*  Yeah, god damn it. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2542.86s)]
*  It's just the Atlantic and the New York Times. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2543.9s)]
*  That's it. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2545.18s)]
*  This is where we eat. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2546.02s)]
*  But like watching them go back and forth, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2547.46s)]
*  it's like, Elon, it's just like kind of falsehood [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2549.9s)]
*  that he probably believes. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2552.7400000000002s)]
*  You know, like if we don't get this out of control, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2554.14s)]
*  spending under control, America will be bankrupt. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2555.98s)]
*  And it's like, well, first of all, you're not, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2558.18s)]
*  like, first of all, no, actually. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2560.3s)]
*  If we don't get USAID under control, we'll be fucking fine. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2562.06s)]
*  Because that's not where spending is. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2565.3s)]
*  And also, okay, let's say there is fraud. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2566.58s)]
*  You know, there's this little bit of like, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2568.58s)]
*  Summers has to do this, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2570.3s)]
*  Larry Summers has to do this, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2571.14s)]
*  where he goes like, some version of like, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2571.98s)]
*  I love your passion, hate fraud myself. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2573.22s)]
*  And it's like, if you show up at a police station [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2575.42s)]
*  and say, I was really worried about crime [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2578.18s)]
*  in my neighborhood, so I arrested some people, [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2579.42s)]
*  they're all in my trunk, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2581.02s)]
*  the cops aren't like, love your passion. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2581.86s)]
*  They're like, you're arrested. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2583.42s)]

*  This is why we're losing. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2683.22s)]
*  The technology in the federal government, [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2684.42s)]

*  Oh, yeah, those gateway computers were housed on them. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2688.9s)]
*  Remember healthcare.gov? [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2691.18s)]
*  Gateway computers, and you had no, [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2692.42s)]

*  because there was no service, the gateway computers. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2698.9s)]

*  Five bars of the OEOB, though. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2701.94s)]
*  But anyway, the fact that, you're right, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2703.42s)]
*  that the fact that you have to do that now, [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2707.54s)]
*  all of that throat clearing before you're like, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2709.7s)]
*  but you know what? [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2711.66s)]
*  It is bad that when everyone has signed off on a payment, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2712.74s)]
*  Congress has mandated it by law, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2715.98s)]

*  then some random 19 year old racist, maybe was, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2719.1s)]

*  The guy who thinks that all the Indians [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2728.64s)]

*  The reason I bring it up is only because I do think, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2740.4599999999996s)]
*  as we talk about how to talk about this, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2743.2999999999997s)]
*  part of it is that we have a, [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2744.7s)]
*  there's a lot of ways in which we're doomed [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2746.74s)]

*  That's pretty courageous. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2852.1800000000003s)]
*  That's bold. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2853.02s)]
*  Maybe think of her State of the Union response. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2854.3s)]
*  Simpler times. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2857.1s)]
*  Just screaming. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2857.94s)]
*  Just in that kitchen. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2859.78s)]
*  In the kitchen? [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2860.6200000000003s)]
*  Now she's like, oh, you're losing [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2861.46s)]
*  your state's largest institution. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2862.42s)]
*  They're getting budget cuts and she's like, [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2863.82s)]
*  oh, we might need a smart targeted approach. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2865.2200000000003s)]
*  Not even like the one that we have. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2867.6600000000003s)]
*  She didn't even say this approach is wrong [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2869.1400000000003s)]
*  and we need a better one. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2871.1s)]
*  We need a smart targeted approach, everyone. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2872.46s)]
*  Thanks, Katie. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2875.46s)]
*  Just want to flag that. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2876.3s)]
*  And right before we started recording, [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2878.18s)]
*  a federal judge in Massachusetts blocked the NIH cuts. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2879.8999999999996s)]
*  So we will now see if the Trump folks appeal that ruling. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2883.2999999999997s)]
*  So we know that most voters generally support [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2886.7799999999997s)]
*  cutting government waste, trimming federal budget. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2889.98s)]
*  It does seem to me like gutting cancer research [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2892.7799999999997s)]
*  and a consumer watchdog that takes on big banks [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2895.18s)]
*  and credit card companies. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2897.98s)]
*  It's potentially the first like really unpopular fight [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2899.4199999999996s)]
*  that Doge has picked. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2902.5s)]
*  What do you guys think? [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2904.14s)]
*  Pick this fight. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2904.98s)]
*  I am shocked by how stupid this is. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2905.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean, what NIH is saying is that grant recipients [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2907.1s)]
*  can spend only 15% of their grant money [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2911.8199999999997s)]
*  on so-called indirect costs. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2913.74s)]
*  But indirect costs are the building where you work, [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2915.14s)]
*  maintenance for your lab, the microscope, support staff, [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2918.66s)]
*  the help you comply with safety regulations. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2922.06s)]
*  And like the big, you know, like evil DEI institutions [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2924.8199999999997s)]
*  like Harvard, they could probably eat that 15%. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2930.1s)]
*  They can deal with this. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2932.74s)]
*  But the smaller research institutions at smaller schools, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2933.8199999999997s)]
*  they're just gonna get forced to shut down. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2938.06s)]
*  And that's why you're hearing Katie Britt weigh in on this, [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2938.9s)]
*  although that fucking moron Tommy Tuberville is like, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2940.94s)]
*  I support the Doge cuts and everything they're doing. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2943.18s)]
*  But it's not just the long-term. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2945.5s)]
*  He also hated the halftime show. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2947.86s)]
*  It's also from that same interview, I believe. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2949.54s)]
*  It's not just the long-term impact on medical research [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2950.82s)]
*  and finding cures and all the things we want, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2955.2999999999997s)]
*  you know, medical research to do. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2957.46s)]
*  The University of Alabama at Birmingham [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2959.2999999999997s)]
*  is the largest employer in the state, right? [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2960.82s)]
*  So this is gonna like ripple out into their economy [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2963.2999999999997s)]
*  in a big way. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2965.9s)]
*  And also it's not like the NIH budget [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2967.5s)]
*  is some runaway fiscal disaster. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2969.02s)]
*  The bulwark reported that the NIH budget [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2971.4599999999996s)]
*  adjusted for inflation is about what it was [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2974.62s)]
*  at the beginning of the Obama administration. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2977.02s)]
*  We spent, look, this is part of the problem too, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2979.54s)]
*  of the like, this is obviously not considered a distraction [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2983.06s)]
*  according to the experts, so we're allowed to talk about it. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2985.5s)]
*  But this is the problem where like, [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2987.58s)]
*  you're only supposed to talk about things [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2989.58s)]
*  in the prescribed correct ways, [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2990.8999999999996s)]
*  because you never get into like the deep substance [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2991.9399999999996s)]
*  of the argument. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2993.54s)]
*  I imagine that you're not, like, for example, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2994.38s)]
*  like, hey, Bunsen burner fucking overhead costs, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=2996.98s)]
*  not a problem. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3001.54s)]
*  This was not a problem we had. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3002.46s)]
*  Overhead costs for scientific research, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3003.82s)]
*  scientific research that can be described as being silly, [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3005.86s)]
*  this is just not a problem America has. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3008.2200000000003s)]
*  Some money that goes towards scientific research [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3010.3s)]
*  is gonna come to nothing. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3012.54s)]
*  That's the point of it. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3013.62s)]
*  That's why you do experiments. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3014.46s)]
*  Some of it doesn't work. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3015.34s)]
*  Some of it sounds silly and then leads to amazing [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3016.3s)]
*  and magical things. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3018.3s)]
*  Like if you were starting a rocket company [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3019.1400000000003s)]
*  and some of the rockets exploded in the air [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3020.42s)]
*  and didn't reach the moon. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3022.42s)]
*  Listen, if you're making every flight at the airport, [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3024.18s)]
*  you're going to the airport too early. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3026.66s)]
*  And if all your scientific research [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3028.1s)]
*  is producing positive results, [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3029.38s)]
*  you're not taking enough risk on scientific research. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3030.58s)]
*  Isn't that from Larry Summers? [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3032.34s)]
*  That is a Larry Summers thing, yes. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3033.82s)]
*  And I've heard that from him in person. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3035.5s)]
*  Which is that- [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3037.3s)]
*  I was thinking over the weekend [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3038.14s)]
*  that I would love someone to describe to the doge bags [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3038.96s)]
*  in Elon that they have found this loan guarantee [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3044.58s)]
*  for this green new deal DEI car company [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3048.54s)]
*  that we need to cut immediately. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3052.42s)]
*  And it's basically just the Tesla loan. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3054.42s)]
*  What we did. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3056.54s)]
*  Let's see what would happen. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3057.38s)]
*  They would have killed it. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3058.2200000000003s)]
*  Sam Stein at the bill work. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3059.06s)]
*  We're really a bull work freaks today. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3061.3s)]
*  But he had a story that basically [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3063.58s)]
*  a lot of these Republican Congress people [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3065.6600000000003s)]
*  who are not saying anything publicly, [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3067.1400000000003s)]
*  their constituents, many of them, [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3068.3s)]
*  some of whom are federal employees, [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3069.86s)]
*  others just have concerns about what's happening [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3070.94s)]
*  in their districts are getting letters [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3072.54s)]
*  from Republicans saying, I too am concerned [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3076.1800000000003s)]
*  about the way in which this is being implemented. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3078.6800000000003s)]
*  I too have concerned about the freeze. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3080.26s)]
*  I too am worried about your privacy. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3081.58s)]
*  And there was a Republican member of the house today [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3083.46s)]
*  that I think one of the first time making the point [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3085.98s)]
*  that Congress's approval on certain decisions [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3088.14s)]
*  isn't just a good thing to have or a nice thing to have. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3092.2999999999997s)]
*  It is a legally necessary thing to have. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3094.54s)]
*  Whether it's cutting budgets [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3096.36s)]
*  or eliminating the Department of Education [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3097.88s)]
*  that the president simply does not have [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3099.38s)]
*  the right to do anything. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3101.34s)]
*  So I do think that the first step is not- [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3102.7999999999997s)]
*  I agree with you that Republicans in Congress [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3106.46s)]
*  have largely just sort of given up. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3108.74s)]
*  But I think we have to just continue. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3110.96s)]
*  There are gonna be some places [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3113.7200000000003s)]
*  where normal politics is still working. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3114.76s)]
*  And those letters to me are a sign [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3116.12s)]
*  that they're Republicans in closely divided districts [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3117.28s)]
*  that are worried about this shit, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3119.7200000000003s)]
*  that are worried about losing their jobs. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3120.8s)]
*  And that's important, that's good, that's a good thing. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3121.96s)]
*  Like, you know, is Katie Britt in any danger in Alabama? [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3123.68s)]
*  Maybe not. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3127.36s)]
*  But there's this woman who is a research professor [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3128.2400000000002s)]
*  at University of North Carolina. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3131.76s)]
*  She was posting over the weekend [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3133.2400000000002s)]
*  that this could decimate their children's hospital, [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3134.56s)]
*  their outpatient care. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3137.92s)]
*  She said the first canceled grant hitting our department [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3139.2s)]
*  that I've heard of was for new interventions [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3141.64s)]
*  supporting NICU patients and parents. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3143.8799999999997s)]
*  These are like newborn babies in the ICU. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3146.56s)]
*  Like, just the idea that this, [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3150.4399999999996s)]
*  like the damage that this is gonna cause. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3152.4399999999996s)]
*  And I do think, you know, Tom Tillis, he's up in 2026. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3155.04s)]
*  He should fucking care about that. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3159.0s)]
*  He's in North Carolina. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3160.2599999999998s)]
*  It represents the research triangle. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3161.1s)]
*  Yeah, I mean- [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3162.68s)]
*  But I do think that, [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3163.52s)]
*  everyone's like, what do we do, what do we do? [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3165.16s)]
*  I think elevating more of these stories as we find them. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3166.94s)]
*  And I would suggest like everyone out there [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3169.88s)]
*  who has these stories, whether it's about medical research, [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3171.78s)]
*  whether it's about any of the other, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3175.14s)]
*  the funding freeze that has been unfrozen [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3176.78s)]
*  but is not really unfrozen, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3179.02s)]
*  and Head Start programs people are still having problems [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3180.44s)]
*  with, like, just, you know, you gotta tell your stories [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3182.78s)]
*  and pass on the stories, send your stories in. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3185.78s)]
*  Because I do think the more we make this about, [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3187.7400000000002s)]
*  like, the people who are feeling these effects [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3190.58s)]
*  or who are worried or who are experts in these fields, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3192.76s)]
*  the scientists, the teachers, all these other, you know, [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3194.7s)]
*  instead of just like federal bureaucrats, [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3198.06s)]
*  which of course, you know, [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3199.8199999999997s)]
*  don't have the best approval rating, [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3200.8199999999997s)]
*  then the more it's gonna hurt. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3203.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, the other part of it too is- [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3205.3399999999997s)]
*  Like- [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3207.22s)]
*  Politically. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3208.06s)]
*  Yes, well, both. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3208.8799999999997s)]
*  But the, like, the inflation reduction act freeze [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3210.1s)]
*  is starting to hit farmers who decided to [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3214.3799999999997s)]
*  take a chance on one of these programs, right? [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3219.8999999999996s)]
*  There's all kinds of conservation programs [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3221.54s)]
*  that involve required investment. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3223.02s)]
*  And they made the investments, [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3224.94s)]
*  and now all of a sudden, they're not getting [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3225.78s)]
*  the payments they expected. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3227.54s)]
*  It's risking their farms, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3228.54s)]
*  it's risking their families' livelihoods. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3229.5s)]
*  And, like, that's a real consequence. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3231.6600000000003s)]
*  And there are plenty of partisan people [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3234.7000000000003s)]
*  who are pretending it's actually not Trump's fault [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3236.1800000000003s)]
*  or trying to allide the fact that it's a political decision [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3239.2200000000003s)]
*  made by Trump and that it's the government that's failing them. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3241.2200000000003s)]
*  There are a lot of, I think, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3243.26s)]
*  people that want that to be the case, [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3244.1000000000004s)]
*  even though everything on some level, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3245.26s)]
*  everyone understands what's going on here. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3246.34s)]
*  And, like, you can't deny, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3247.98s)]
*  like, there's only so much Trump can do [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3249.78s)]
*  to deny that reality. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3251.54s)]
*  And so making sure people understand that reality [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3252.46s)]
*  is really important. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3255.14s)]
*  There's another one more point I wanted to make about this, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3255.98s)]
*  which I like, is, like, how do we talk about [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3257.42s)]
*  the fact that they're doing this? [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3259.54s)]
*  You know, CFPB, one of the most effective government agencies, [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3261.7s)]
*  done an incredible amount of good. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3265.02s)]
*  $800 million budget, by the way. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3268.3s)]
*  $20 billion returned in the consumers. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3270.18s)]
*  Exactly what you would want government, [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3273.7s)]
*  not perfect, makes mistakes, I'm sure, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3275.18s)]
*  but, like, exactly what you would want your government. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3277.14s)]
*  Just a tribune for working people [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3278.98s)]
*  against the rapacious, giant financial corporations. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3281.02s)]
*  Trump has sent all those people home. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3285.5400000000004s)]
*  They're still getting paid. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3287.5800000000004s)]
*  So Donald Trump's cost efficiency [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3288.86s)]
*  is he's basically given a snow day [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3291.3s)]
*  to federal officials because they don't like certain parts [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3293.94s)]
*  of what the government is doing. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3297.5400000000004s)]
*  Because they attended a diversity training [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3298.86s)]
*  in 2014 somewhere. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3300.7400000000002s)]
*  And so right now, the American people [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3302.5400000000004s)]
*  are paying government workers to sit at home [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3304.26s)]
*  instead of go after big banks, [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3307.6200000000003s)]
*  try to cure diseases, try to prevent diseases [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3311.1s)]
*  in foreign countries, whatever it may be. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3313.66s)]
*  Those people are still getting paid in their houses. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3315.26s)]
*  Like, I do not understand, [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3317.82s)]
*  that to me is worth mentioning. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3318.98s)]
*  We still are not tainting our federal government [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3320.34s)]
*  with their wokeness. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3321.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3323.54s)]
*  Doing all this under the guise of that DEI attack [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3324.38s)]
*  is so pathetic. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3326.98s)]
*  This also, it is entirely out of the Project 2025 playbook, [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3327.82s)]
*  and I do think it helps to remind people of this. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3331.2200000000003s)]
*  I saw people referring to the halftime show [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3332.94s)]
*  as a DEI halftime show, which is, I think, [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3336.2200000000003s)]
*  which is sort of drawing a little too much attention [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3339.26s)]
*  to what the word DEI is really standing in for. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3340.94s)]
*  Yeah, no, now it's just any person of color or woman [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3343.42s)]
*  who has any kind of position of authority or influence [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3347.06s)]
*  is DEI. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3350.3s)]
*  That's the new thing now. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3351.14s)]
*  Yeah, Benny Johnson, the TPUSA plagiarist, tweeted, [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3352.46s)]
*  hey, NFL, it's Trump was elected. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3356.3s)]
*  We're not gonna pretend we like bad halftime shows anymore. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3359.58s)]
*  And I was like, yes, people famously never complain [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3362.94s)]
*  about the halftime show. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3365.7000000000003s)]
*  So Twitter was invented for you. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3366.94s)]
*  It is, to go back to your point, though, [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3368.66s)]
*  they're just, they have to play, [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3370.02s)]
*  if they have nothing to complain about, they have nothing. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3372.14s)]
*  If they can't complain about how they've been put upon [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3375.3799999999997s)]
*  and how much power they have. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3378.14s)]
*  You're in charge of all the money, all the power. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3379.4199999999996s)]
*  Two last things here, both related to worthless coins. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3381.8999999999996s)]
*  Trump announced that he was ordering the mint [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3384.7s)]
*  to stop producing the penny on the grounds [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3386.8999999999996s)]
*  that it costs well more than a penny to produce them, [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3389.14s)]
*  and no one likes dealing with them. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3391.98s)]
*  Our future 51st state, Canada, banned the penny in 2014. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3394.42s)]
*  Everything seems to be fine there, [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3400.2599999999998s)]
*  except for the fact that America's gonna take it over. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3401.5s)]
*  Separately, the New York Times did an investigation [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3403.58s)]
*  into the Trump meme coin and how early investors [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3405.8199999999997s)]
*  in the Trump family made millions from the meme coin [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3409.42s)]
*  while everyone else lost tons. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3412.9s)]
*  Let's start with the penny. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3415.06s)]
*  Love it, thoughts on the demise of the penny? [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3416.06s)]
*  Shocker, I have previously held deep thoughts about this, [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3418.2999999999997s)]
*  so obviously people are pointing out [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3422.82s)]
*  that the penny costs four cents to make. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3423.94s)]
*  That's obviously stupid. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3425.34s)]
*  Nickels cost 14 cents to make. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3426.58s)]
*  Now yes, probably percentage of the penny [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3428.76s)]
*  is more expensive per penny, [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3430.46s)]
*  but just for each nickel, it's a nine cent loser. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3432.1s)]
*  Here's what we should do. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3435.46s)]
*  Get rid of the nickels too. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3436.5s)]
*  What we should do is we should go what we have now. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3437.62s)]
*  You have to go a little bit further. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3439.5s)]
*  You stick with me. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3441.34s)]
*  Don't take my quarter. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3442.18s)]
*  We should go from penny nickel dime quarter, [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3443.26s)]
*  and we should be moving to a 10 cent piece, [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3446.66s)]
*  a 20 cent piece, and a 50 cent piece. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3448.94s)]
*  Those are the correct dominations, [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3451.18s)]
*  and all prices should no longer be to the 100th place. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3452.3799999999997s)]
*  They should be to the 10th place. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3455.1s)]
*  That is the answer. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3456.94s)]
*  Trump is doing a kind of compromise, [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3457.8999999999996s)]
*  but leaving the dumb nickel in place, [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3460.98s)]
*  which has the most overrated founder on it, [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3463.2599999999998s)]
*  who is Thomas Jefferson. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3465.24s)]
*  Now here's what's interesting. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3467.4199999999996s)]
*  Until 1857, there was a half penny. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3468.54s)]
*  That was when we had the half penny. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3470.46s)]
*  Then the half penny was gotten rid of, [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3471.62s)]
*  so the penny's been our smallest denomination [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3472.8199999999997s)]
*  for a very, very long time. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3475.06s)]
*  From 1913 to 2024, inflation has increased [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3476.3399999999997s)]
*  the value of the dollar by 30 times, right? [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3478.86s)]
*  Which means if the penny was the lowest denomination [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3481.7000000000003s)]
*  in 1913, we could get by with a 30 cent coin today, right? [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3484.38s)]
*  I don't think that's necessary, [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3488.34s)]
*  but we should go to a nickel, a 20 cent piece, [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3489.86s)]
*  and a 50 cent piece. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3492.54s)]
*  That's the answer. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3494.06s)]
*  And that's how Democrats can have their own positive agenda. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3495.26s)]
*  You know, if you pass that idea along [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3499.1400000000003s)]
*  to Iwan in the doge bags, [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3501.78s)]
*  I might. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3503.6200000000003s)]
*  You might end up being in charge of the US Mint. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3504.46s)]
*  You might be able to mint all the money yourself. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3507.74s)]
*  Think about all the. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3509.86s)]
*  Think about Norman Mineta. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3510.7s)]
*  I'll get in there, and I'll put an op-ed in about. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3511.52s)]
*  You'll never. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3513.42s)]
*  You said Norman Mineta? [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3514.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, he was a token lib and a conservative. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3515.08s)]
*  I thought he was the transportation. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3516.7s)]
*  Oh yeah, he was the transportation. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3517.9s)]
*  But he was the token. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3518.74s)]
*  He was the token. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3519.82s)]
*  Republican. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3520.66s)]
*  Republican and a Democratic administration. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3521.5s)]
*  Who would I be? [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3522.5s)]
*  Ray LaHood, sorry. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3523.5s)]
*  Oh yeah, no, but who would the. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3524.34s)]
*  You're Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3525.18s)]
*  Who's the. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3526.02s)]
*  You're Tulsi Gabbard, that's right. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3526.86s)]
*  RFK Junior. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3528.02s)]
*  I have a lot, listen, I got a lot of good ideas. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3528.94s)]
*  And I can show myself able to work [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3530.74s)]
*  with some pretty bro-y guys. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3533.28s)]
*  The whole thing would save you like 80 million dollars, [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3534.74s)]
*  the penny thing? [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3536.8199999999997s)]
*  This is a very, it's like fucking. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3537.66s)]
*  No, no, the penny's billions. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3539.46s)]
*  The penny's billions. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3540.98s)]
*  I thought that the, I read that the savings was 80 million. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3541.8199999999997s)]
*  I don't know how they're netting that out. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3544.3399999999997s)]
*  85 million each year. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3548.3399999999997s)]
*  Huh. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3549.68s)]
*  It is funny, you learn such a raging [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3550.52s)]
*  about these small sums of money and little changes, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3551.9199999999996s)]
*  and he gets 15 billion in contracts [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3554.3799999999997s)]
*  from the US government. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3556.58s)]
*  I'll tell you something, here's the mistake I made. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3557.4199999999996s)]
*  We mint three billion pennies. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3558.3799999999997s)]
*  Okay, there you go. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3559.8599999999997s)]
*  That was my mistake. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3560.7s)]
*  Obama wanted to do this. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3561.54s)]
*  Obama expressed his support for this in 2013. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3562.66s)]
*  He got cowed by the fucking deep state. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3565.2999999999997s)]
*  And he said, this is not gonna be a huge savings [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3566.8199999999997s)]
*  for government, he was right. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3569.42s)]
*  But anytime we're spending more money [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3570.46s)]
*  on something that people don't actually use, [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3571.7s)]
*  that's an example of something we should probably change. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3573.46s)]
*  He should be in Doge, huh? [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3575.5s)]
*  Look at that guy, wanting to cut costs. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3577.14s)]
*  Leave a hero, live long enough to become a villain. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3579.22s)]
*  I don't know how that whole thing went down. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3581.02s)]
*  I remember, I think Cody Keenan, [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3582.3599999999997s)]
*  who was the speechwriter after we left, [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3584.54s)]
*  was on this very podcast once telling us [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3585.8199999999997s)]
*  about how there was a request to get it [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3588.06s)]
*  into the state of the union, the penny thing. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3590.8599999999997s)]
*  There was a whole thing. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3593.26s)]
*  I'm sure the deep state probably killed it. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3594.1000000000004s)]
*  Well, I think there was a couple hiccups. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3595.9s)]
*  There was an Illinois problem. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3600.42s)]
*  I think the nickel thing comes up. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3601.5s)]
*  The nickel thing comes up. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3602.6600000000003s)]
*  There's lobbyists involved. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3603.6600000000003s)]
*  Eh, you know, government doesn't work. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3605.7000000000003s)]
*  Tommy, tell us about... [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3607.48s)]
*  Well, you know who it works for. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3608.58s)]
*  Works for Donald Trump. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3612.3s)]
*  Billionaires. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3613.1400000000003s)]
*  Tell us about the shit coin, the Trump shit coin. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3613.98s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there was a report over the weekend [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3615.46s)]
*  in the New York Times. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3617.78s)]
*  Let me back up. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3618.6200000000003s)]
*  You guys might remember just before the inauguration [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3619.78s)]
*  when Donald Trump announced the sale of a meme coin, [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3622.6200000000003s)]
*  Trump coin, and it was the next day, [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3625.6200000000003s)]
*  Melania announced the sale of her Melania coin. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3627.86s)]
*  So the price skyrocketed, then it fell. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3630.98s)]
*  People accused him of a rug pull. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3635.1000000000004s)]
*  It was this whole kind of weird grifting thing [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3637.1400000000003s)]
*  that was happening on the sidelines. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3639.02s)]
*  You're using a rug pull is basically, [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3640.42s)]
*  you launch the thing, the price skyrockets, [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3642.8s)]
*  you get out when it's high, [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3645.1400000000003s)]
*  and then the whole thing falls apart. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3647.4s)]
*  Yeah, you own most of it, you market it heavily, [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3648.24s)]
*  and then you sell a bunch of your shares [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3650.72s)]
*  of whatever the thing is, [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3653.14s)]
*  and the people who bought in late get screwed, [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3655.14s)]
*  and the people who own them early make a lot of money. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3657.4799999999996s)]
*  Kind of like the Hawk Toa coin for those [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3659.68s)]
*  who are big fans of the Hawk Toa podcast. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3662.04s)]
*  The New York Times over the weekend reported that, [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3664.3199999999997s)]
*  as of last week, at least 810,000 people [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3666.7799999999997s)]
*  have lost money on the Trump coin, [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3670.3199999999997s)]
*  but the Trump family and its partners [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3672.12s)]
*  flipped them for a profit of $109 billion, [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3674.2s)]
*  because they get paid every time you buy and sell it. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3676.48s)]
*  Also, a Trump-owned business owns 80% of the supply, [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3678.44s)]
*  so if they wanted to sell a bunch of their coins, [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3683.76s)]
*  they could make a lot of money. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3685.52s)]
*  Also, there's all this shady shit that was happening. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3686.94s)]
*  There was some mystery account [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3689.36s)]
*  that bought millions of Trump coins [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3690.66s)]
*  just minutes after they were offered [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3692.64s)]
*  for like 19 cents or whatever, [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3694.16s)]
*  and then flipped them for a profit [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3697.36s)]
*  of what they think is about $109 million. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3699.0s)]
*  So it was just this massive grift happening in plain sight, [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3702.2s)]
*  and it kind of ties into our CFPB conversation earlier, [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3705.2s)]
*  because getting rid of the CFPB [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3708.68s)]
*  means you're gonna have small community banks [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3710.7999999999997s)]
*  regulated by a different set of regulators. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3713.3999999999996s)]
*  Big banks no longer have a regulator, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3716.4199999999996s)]
*  because they're all regulated by the CFPB, [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3718.7s)]
*  and then you have this proliferation [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3720.4399999999996s)]
*  of bank-like companies that provide bank-like services, [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3723.16s)]
*  but are not backed by the FDIC. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3728.68s)]
*  There's no deposit insurance and aren't regulated well. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3730.72s)]
*  So it's just like the Wild Wild West. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3733.64s)]
*  It's all like blockchain mumbo jumbo bullshit. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3736.16s)]
*  Do the big banks still, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3738.12s)]
*  they're still regulated by Dodd-Frank stuff, right? [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3739.3599999999997s)]
*  They are, but Dodd-Frank pushed [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3741.52s)]
*  all the regulatory authority to the CFPB. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3743.44s)]
*  So it's like this zombie set of laws [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3746.08s)]
*  without an agency to enforce it. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3748.24s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of the consumer protections [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3749.56s)]
*  run out of CFPB, [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3751.16s)]
*  and if the CFPB is no longer enforcing those laws, [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3752.64s)]
*  the other agencies that have purview over the banks [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3754.96s)]
*  don't suddenly pick up the slack. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3757.68s)]
*  They are not in charge with those. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3759.22s)]
*  They do a lot of the other systemic regulations, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3760.44s)]
*  but they're not in charge of that. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3762.14s)]
*  Don't worry, they also wanna get rid of the FDIC, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3762.98s)]
*  so that's on their agenda as well. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3764.12s)]
*  But even in just sort of normal year, [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3767.92s)]
*  the CFPB would modify rules to account for inflation [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3770.12s)]
*  or when the pandemic hit, they made a bunch of changes [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3773.56s)]
*  just to account for the economic shock that was happening, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3775.8399999999997s)]
*  and now there isn't a agency to exist to do that. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3777.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, the other thing too is these, [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3781.3599999999997s)]
*  financial institutions are raptors testing the fences, [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3783.24s)]
*  and they see this happening. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3786.52s)]
*  And no, I think a lot of the more serious [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3787.96s)]
*  and big financial institutions are not, [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3790.6s)]
*  some of them do just explicitly break the law [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3792.08s)]
*  as they see fit, but in most cases what they'll do [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3793.8s)]
*  is be like, huh, that thing we were gonna maybe try, [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3795.8s)]
*  but we're afraid the CFPB might stop, [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3798.52s)]
*  let's just fucking go for it. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3800.44s)]
*  Let's offer a new product that has lower interest, [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3801.76s)]
*  but not tell our customers about it [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3804.28s)]
*  so they don't accidentally have more interest. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3805.6800000000003s)]
*  There's a bunch of shit that these banks can pull. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3808.36s)]
*  Yes, well, it's a little, [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3810.4s)]
*  just one example is overdraft protection. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3812.1200000000003s)]
*  I remember standing outside the Iowa Obama [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3814.2400000000002s)]
*  for America office and screaming at Bank of America [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3817.88s)]
*  because they had let me buy seven coffees [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3820.2s)]
*  and overdraw my account every single time, [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3824.44s)]
*  and then charge me a courtesy fee of 25, [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3826.6s)]
*  then escalated to $35 each time, [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3829.3199999999997s)]
*  rather than just being like, bro, you have no money, [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3831.3999999999996s)]
*  and cutting off the transaction, not letting it through. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3833.3999999999996s)]
*  And apparently the CFPB, when it was created, [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3835.96s)]
*  there was someone who worked at a bank [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3838.2799999999997s)]
*  talking about how their institution [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3839.96s)]
*  reformed their ways of charging those fees [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3842.3599999999997s)]
*  because they were worried the CFPB [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3847.0s)]
*  was gonna come after them. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3848.56s)]
*  So the mere existence of this agency [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3850.2s)]
*  was protecting consumers, and now it will just be gone. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3851.72s)]
*  I got hit with so many overdraft fees [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3855.3599999999997s)]
*  when I was a Senate staffer not making a lot of money. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3857.24s)]
*  Happened all the time. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3860.24s)]
*  So Donald Trump and Melania launching a shit coin [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3861.48s)]
*  that made them $100 million, [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3865.24s)]
*  well, a bunch of people get screwed, [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3866.96s)]
*  and then there is that professor at UNC who's like, [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3868.44s)]
*  oh, we're trying to do research [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3871.96s)]
*  to make sure we can keep babies alive in the NICU, [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3874.9199999999996s)]
*  but no more, can't do that anymore, [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3876.8399999999997s)]
*  and then the fucking $2 malaria nets [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3878.2s)]
*  that we're not sending to protect kids in Africa anymore [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3880.7999999999997s)]
*  because we've destroyed USAID [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3883.56s)]
*  and the $400 million in food assistance [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3885.16s)]
*  that is now that people are just gonna starve, [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3887.96s)]
*  and they're like, oh, what the fuck? [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3890.16s)]
*  Well, also it's like, even just do like the apples to apples. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3891.9199999999996s)]
*  Right now they're figuring out how to extend the Trump, [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3895.12s)]
*  like what is the cause of America's budget deficit? [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3897.7599999999998s)]
*  The cause of the American budget deficit [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3900.3599999999997s)]
*  are the Bush tax cuts, the Trump tax cuts, [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3901.7599999999998s)]
*  the military, social security, Medicare, Medicaid. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3903.7999999999997s)]
*  That's it. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3906.16s)]
*  And woke-ism, but fucking DEI expensive chemical showers [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3907.24s)]
*  at the fucking scientific institute is not our problem. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3913.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's all the money we're spending [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3916.8s)]
*  to turn animals trans in India. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3919.52s)]
*  Too many, yeah. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3922.72s)]
*  That's what Senator John Kerry. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3923.56s)]
*  Too many non-binary frogs in India is the problem. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3925.08s)]
*  Okay, when we come back from the break, [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3930.28s)]
*  you're gonna hear my conversation [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3931.72s)]
*  with strict scrutiny's Leah Lippman [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3932.56s)]

*  to stop Trump and Musk. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3935.52s)]
*  Two quick things before we do that. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3937.04s)]

*  Woodworking is, your mic says right here, [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3955.72s)]
*  Woodworking is your much needed breather [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3958.36s)]

*  Yeah, that's good. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3961.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I said actually. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3962.04s)]
*  I remember when our CEO, Lucinda, first read Woodworking [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3963.2s)]
*  as we were thinking about, [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3967.08s)]
*  do we want this to be part of Crooked Media Reads? [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3967.92s)]
*  And she was like, read it in a day [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3969.7599999999998s)]
*  and was like, this is one of the best ones I've ever read. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3971.64s)]
*  She wouldn't stop talking about it. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3973.16s)]
*  Yeah, I also do think too, [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3974.44s)]
*  think about how much trans attention you see on Fox News [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3977.08s)]
*  versus how many trans people you see on Fox News. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3981.68s)]
*  And the answer is none, ever. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3984.3599999999997s)]
*  And the term Woodworking is the description [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3986.16s)]
*  of this character's experience of being trans, [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3988.44s)]
*  and I think it is worth spending time [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3991.0s)]
*  thinking about the perspective of trans people [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=3994.76s)]

*  It's doing fine. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4304.12s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4305.5199999999995s)]
*  I knew, I know. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4306.759999999999s)]
*  The piece is by Harvard law professor Noah Feldman. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4307.719999999999s)]
*  And here's the part I'd love to hear your thoughts on quote, [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4310.719999999999s)]
*  Trump who did not ignore court orders in his first term [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4313.799999999999s)]
*  is unlikely to defy a judicial decision. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4317.28s)]
*  No matter how conservative the justices [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4320.24s)]
*  in the Supreme Court majority might be, [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4322.599999999999s)]
*  their primary identity comes from their role [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4324.959999999999s)]
*  as interpreters of the constitution and laws. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4327.32s)]
*  They might tolerate a lot from Trump, [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4329.679999999999s)]
*  but they won't tolerate defiance of the authority [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4331.719999999999s)]
*  of the judiciary. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4336.16s)]
*  What do you think? [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4337.0s)]
*  How's your blood pressure? [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4337.84s)]
*  So for those of you not watching the video, [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4339.28s)]
*  my eyes are literally bugging out of my face at this point. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4340.88s)]
*  This is why you should go to Michigan for law school [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4343.639999999999s)]
*  rather than Harvard, side note. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4345.28s)]
*  One, the idea that everything is working, [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4347.32s)]
*  the system is working is just so divorced from reality, [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4350.639999999999s)]
*  it is difficult to relay that. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4353.92s)]
*  I mean, even if courts are striking down some [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4356.2s)]
*  of what Trump is doing, [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4358.599999999999s)]
*  the damage he is wreaking on the infrastructure [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4359.96s)]
*  of the federal government is profound, right? [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4361.96s)]
*  Like scaring away all of these civil servants, [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4365.68s)]
*  letting these doge whatevers, [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4367.36s)]
*  like infiltrate the treasury department, [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4369.52s)]
*  these are things that have already happened [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4371.84s)]
*  and that courts are not going to be able to claw back. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4374.28s)]
*  So that's just like a first step. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4378.96s)]
*  Now the idea that Donald Trump is just going to respect [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4381.18s)]
*  all of these court orders, [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4383.8s)]
*  aged really well over like seven days, let's say, [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4385.64s)]
*  as his vice president took to the media, [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4389.96s)]
*  is floating the idea that he had floated four years earlier, [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4392.28s)]
*  if you had bothered to be remotely online [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4396.12s)]
*  when he was suggesting that Donald Trump [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4398.719999999999s)]
*  fire every member of the civil servant [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4400.24s)]
*  and basically tell the Supreme Court, [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4402.16s)]
*  you made your decision, try and enforce it. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4404.5599999999995s)]
*  And they're already floating as he did previously, [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4406.76s)]
*  the suggestion that they weren't going to obey [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4410.12s)]
*  various court orders that told them, [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4412.08s)]
*  no, you can't do wildly illegal things. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4414.0s)]
*  So I can't say the system is working super well right now, [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4416.32s)]
*  is kind of the TLDR. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4421.62s)]
*  JD Vance's tweet, and we'll get into the case in a second, [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4424.42s)]
*  but his tweet, the money line was, [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4427.94s)]
*  judges aren't allowed to control [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4432.099999999999s)]
*  the executive's legitimate power. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4434.24s)]
*  Now, I didn't go to law school, [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4437.0599999999995s)]
*  nor did I even take the LSATs [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4439.82s)]
*  and get a good score like John Lovett. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4441.54s)]
*  But I guess that is maybe technically true [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4444.24s)]
*  in that if the power is legitimate, [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4447.94s)]
*  they can't control it, but like, [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4449.74s)]
*  who decides if the power is legitimate? [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4451.94s)]
*  Well, so this isn't even a question [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4454.5s)]
*  about courts being in a position [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4456.54s)]
*  to decide all of the questions in our legal system. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4458.5s)]
*  It is about the fact that the executive branch [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4462.139999999999s)]
*  is subject to the law. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4464.7s)]
*  And in these cases, that law is really fucking clear. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4466.58s)]
*  It is directly compelled by the lawmaker [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4470.66s)]
*  in our constitutional system, Congress, [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4472.86s)]
*  who told the executive branch, [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4474.42s)]
*  like, no, you don't just get to not spend [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4475.58s)]
*  whatever money you don't like that we appropriate, [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4477.74s)]
*  or the constitution is unusually clear, [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4480.34s)]
*  like in the case of birthright citizenship. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4483.26s)]
*  So this is an instance where it's not about courts [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4485.2s)]
*  being good or awesome or constitutional caretakers. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4487.78s)]
*  It's just about whether the executive branch [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4490.54s)]
*  is subject to the law. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4493.22s)]
*  And there are so many foundational court cases [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4495.639999999999s)]
*  that obviously tell presidents to not do things [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4498.5599999999995s)]
*  or to do things, right? [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4501.7s)]
*  Like one of the biggest presidential power cases [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4503.26s)]
*  is a case called Youngstown, [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4505.7s)]
*  where the Supreme Court told President Truman, [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4507.179999999999s)]
*  no, you can't just seize the steel mills. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4508.86s)]
*  And JD Vance, of course, has been praising [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4511.179999999999s)]
*  Supreme Court decisions that told democratic presidents [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4514.38s)]
*  they can't do things. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4517.46s)]
*  Like, for example, the immunity ruling [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4518.66s)]
*  that let Donald Trump get off scot-free [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4520.66s)]
*  for attempting a coup first time around. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4522.66s)]
*  He was describing that as a massive win, right, [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4525.26s)]
*  for the rule of law, [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4527.9s)]
*  even though that decision told the executive branch, [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4529.08s)]
*  you cannot prosecute a former president for official acts. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4530.88s)]
*  So he knows, right, this is horseshit. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4533.66s)]
*  And yes, right, it is wildly inconsistent [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4536.42s)]
*  with basic premises of our constitutional system. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4539.74s)]
*  I'm not gonna ask you to, like, predict [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4542.92s)]
*  what the Supreme Court might do, [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4544.42s)]
*  but like, how do you think JD Vance's tweet [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4545.82s)]
*  or his view of the power that the executive holds [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4549.639999999999s)]
*  will land with even this Supreme Court? [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4553.42s)]
*  And I'm thinking particularly of, like, [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4556.54s)]
*  Robert's, Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett, [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4558.76s)]
*  like, who knows what Alito and Thomas are probably like, [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4562.02s)]
*  yeah, you're right, you got it. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4564.620000000001s)]
*  We'll just, we'll go on vacation on our private jets. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4565.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so a few things. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4569.14s)]
*  I don't think it is going to hit well with those guys, [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4571.740000000001s)]
*  and it's not gonna hit well for any number of reasons. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4574.660000000001s)]
*  One is that JD Vance is essentially claiming the power, [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4577.620000000001s)]
*  not just of Congress, right, to make laws, defies laws, [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4581.700000000001s)]
*  but here the power of the courts, right, [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4585.1s)]
*  to, again, enforce laws that Congress has made. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4587.18s)]
*  And these guys on the Supreme Court, [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4591.26s)]
*  they are judicial supremacists, right? [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4593.26s)]
*  Like, they think they have the power to decide all things. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4595.0s)]
*  And so having some weird dweeb, [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4598.42s)]
*  like JD Vance tell them, right, [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4600.62s)]
*  like, no, you don't actually get to have your fingers [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4602.3s)]
*  in all the cookie jars, is not going to go over well [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4604.860000000001s)]
*  with them, and so I don't think, right, [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4608.320000000001s)]
*  they are going to be cool with this, [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4610.66s)]
*  and there are going to be certain cases where, again, [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4612.3s)]
*  the law is just sufficiently clear, [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4615.320000000001s)]
*  whether we're talking about federal statutes [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4617.54s)]
*  or the Constitution, [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4620.06s)]
*  and what the Trump administration is trying to do [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4622.18s)]
*  is just wildly destabilizing in other ways, [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4625.3s)]
*  like where you had the executive branch saying, [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4628.34s)]
*  we're not actually going to spend federal money [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4630.38s)]
*  that Congress has appropriated. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4632.620000000001s)]
*  Like, that's horrible for the rule of law, [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4634.72s)]
*  like even for finance bros. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4637.660000000001s)]
*  Like, it's bad when the federal government [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4639.14s)]
*  doesn't pay out money that Congress said it would. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4640.900000000001s)]
*  So it's not even like this is a big conflict of interest [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4643.700000000001s)]
*  for them when they're thinking about rule of law [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4646.900000000001s)]
*  and like my rich friends. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4650.34s)]
*  So the ruling that seems to have really set them all off [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4652.34s)]
*  in MAGA world over the weekend came from [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4655.0599999999995s)]
*  US district judge Paul Engelmayer in response to a lawsuit [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4658.0199999999995s)]
*  brought by state attorneys general over access [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4661.78s)]
*  to the treasury payment system. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4664.179999999999s)]
*  The judge issued an order that said, [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4666.179999999999s)]
*  only career officials who've had the proper training [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4668.099999999999s)]
*  can access the system, not Elon and the doge bags. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4670.54s)]
*  And some Trump folks interpreted the ruling to mean [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4675.74s)]
*  that even treasury secretary Scott Besson [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4678.34s)]
*  wasn't allowed to access the system. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4680.62s)]
*  Though it seems like at least as of this recording, [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4682.54s)]
*  then another federal judge has given [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4685.0s)]
*  the department of justice and the state AGs [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4686.62s)]
*  some time to work out an agreement [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4688.900000000001s)]
*  over who gets access to the payment system. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4690.9800000000005s)]
*  And the DOJ says that so far, [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4693.38s)]
*  despite JD Vance's tweets, they are abiding by the order. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4696.06s)]
*  Is this a case where the actual legal process [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4700.14s)]
*  looks different or at least, [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4703.78s)]
*  I wouldn't say it's proceeding normally, [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4705.62s)]
*  but is at least proceeding on a different track [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4707.0s)]
*  than the political conversation? [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4709.08s)]
*  Yeah, so the legal process is proceeding differently, [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4711.56s)]
*  I think in at least two ways. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4715.48s)]
*  One is the legal system is attempting to deal with something [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4717.28s)]
*  that is in many ways unprecedented, [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4722.78s)]
*  like the systematic unconstitutional and illegal acts [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4725.2s)]
*  that this administration is doing. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4728.98s)]
*  And so they are trying to craft these orders quickly [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4730.54s)]
*  because what they are doing, [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4733.96s)]
*  if allowed to go into effect, [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4736.12s)]
*  is just gonna have these immediate profound consequences [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4737.5599999999995s)]
*  that would be difficult to reverse. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4740.4s)]
*  And so they are being forced to proceed on a pace [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4742.12s)]
*  that is a little bit different [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4744.88s)]
*  than the average legal process. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4746.0s)]
*  And at a volume that again is a little bit different. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4748.16s)]
*  And yes, they are figuring out exactly the scope [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4753.2s)]
*  of their orders that they are having to do [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4756.64s)]
*  on a pretty tight timeline that isn't usual for courts. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4759.28s)]
*  And that's because the administration [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4764.5199999999995s)]
*  put them in this position. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4766.2s)]
*  And so I do not take what the administration [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4768.36s)]
*  is telling courts or doing in courts [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4772.08s)]
*  to evince a position that they think [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4774.48s)]
*  they can deny court orders. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4778.0s)]
*  They are not telling courts that, [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4779.84s)]
*  they are saying they are in compliance. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4781.44s)]
*  And all of the litigation and disagreement [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4783.5s)]
*  is about what exactly these orders require right now [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4786.679999999999s)]
*  and how courts should modify them. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4790.36s)]
*  The other conversation is happening more [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4792.56s)]
*  in the public sphere and political sphere. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4794.68s)]
*  And of course that's a huge warning sign [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4796.320000000001s)]
*  because who knows whether it will sift into the former. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4799.160000000001s)]
*  But it does seem like at least for now, [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4802.68s)]
*  they are not adopting the expressed position [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4806.120000000001s)]
*  that like, fuck it, let's just do it and be legends. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4808.92s)]
*  And that's something. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4811.52s)]
*  Yet. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4813.360000000001s)]
*  Right, exactly, yet. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4814.200000000001s)]
*  Well, on that note, there were some actions [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4816.120000000001s)]
*  the Trump folks have taken like birthright citizenship, [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4818.92s)]
*  which seems obviously illegal or unconstitutional enough [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4821.88s)]
*  that it feels like they are just throwing them out there [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4825.28s)]
*  on the chance that maybe they get five justices [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4827.96s)]
*  to agree with them at some point, [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4831.28s)]
*  or they just wanna throw it out there, right? [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4832.4800000000005s)]
*  Just flood the zone. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4834.28s)]
*  Then there are examples like [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4835.400000000001s)]
*  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, for example, right? [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4837.28s)]
*  Which is they know it is against the law [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4840.52s)]
*  to just eliminate an independent agency [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4842.92s)]
*  that was created by Congress. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4844.86s)]
*  So instead, they just put Russ Vogt, [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4846.0s)]
*  the new OMB director in charge [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4848.74s)]
*  and like told everyone to stop working. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4850.5s)]
*  How much functional dismantling of the federal government [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4852.78s)]
*  do you think they can do within the bounds of the law? [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4855.98s)]
*  They can do an immense amount. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4859.26s)]
*  And that's part of why I just went ballistic [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4860.78s)]
*  when you read the title of the op-ed [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4863.14s)]
*  that talked about the system working. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4865.58s)]
*  Because even if, again, courts are striking down [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4867.3s)]
*  everything that is illegal, even if, right, [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4870.7s)]
*  the executive branch adheres to all of those decisions, [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4872.94s)]
*  there are still many, many things they can do [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4875.7s)]
*  to hollow out the federal bureaucracy, right? [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4878.14s)]
*  Like if they put all of these administrators on leave, [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4880.900000000001s)]
*  if they say, we're just not gonna bring any new cases [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4884.620000000001s)]
*  under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, right? [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4887.76s)]
*  They are just going to allow consumer fraud to run rampant. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4889.900000000001s)]
*  They're going to cause people to leave the administration [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4892.9800000000005s)]
*  and administrative state. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4896.26s)]
*  And it is impossible to quickly build back up [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4897.38s)]
*  that infrastructure, right, [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4900.620000000001s)]
*  in the next competent, sane administration. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4902.240000000001s)]
*  And so that's part of why, like, [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4905.54s)]
*  we are in a constitutional crisis, [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4908.14s)]
*  whether or not the executive branch [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4910.94s)]
*  refuses to comply with court orders, [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4912.98s)]
*  because, like, they are using their power [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4915.54s)]
*  to basically undermine our system of government, [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4918.26s)]
*  our system of laws, trying to do it in any number of ways, [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4921.7s)]
*  some of which might be legal, right, [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4925.9s)]
*  some of which might be not, [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4927.62s)]
*  some of which courts are gonna be able to stop, [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4929.0199999999995s)]
*  and some of which courts aren't. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4930.9s)]
*  And inevitably, when courts strike [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4932.74s)]
*  some of the more outlandish, obviously, [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4935.179999999999s)]
*  illegal policies down, [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4937.139999999999s)]
*  I worry that that is going to give [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4938.98s)]
*  the administration cover and the courts cover [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4941.179999999999s)]
*  to let other things through, [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4944.26s)]
*  because it is going to present a facade [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4946.04s)]
*  of the system working, right? [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4948.179999999999s)]
*  And the court will look like an independent check [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4949.86s)]
*  on an executive branch that, again, [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4952.0599999999995s)]
*  even if it respects court orders, [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4953.98s)]
*  is acting in ways that are absolutely antithetical [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4956.3s)]
*  to a functioning constitutional democracy [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4961.0s)]
*  and the rule of law. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4963.84s)]
*  Right, and as you point out, at some point, [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4965.0s)]
*  the fact that government services that people depend on [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4968.36s)]
*  and benefits will be so disrupted, [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4971.24s)]
*  whether or not a court decides that the administration [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4974.12s)]
*  took an action that was illegal or not, [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4977.88s)]
*  like, the results seem like they could be similar. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4980.76s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4984.08s)]
*  So if, for example, right, there's some uncertainty [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4984.92s)]
*  about whether the federal government [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4987.16s)]
*  is actually going to give out these payments, [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4988.6s)]
*  there are some organizations that run [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4991.4800000000005s)]
*  on a paycheck-to-paycheck, disbursement-to-dispersement [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4993.4800000000005s)]
*  basis, people's healthcare will be interrupted, [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4996.360000000001s)]
*  childcare, right, is going to be disrupted, [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=4999.200000000001s)]
*  and even if a court stops that later, [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5001.4800000000005s)]
*  that is not going to undo the immense harm [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5004.4400000000005s)]
*  that people will already have experienced [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5007.72s)]
*  and that the administration is already going to be [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5010.360000000001s)]
*  unleashing on all of us. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5012.64s)]
*  Obviously, the Supreme Court has an expansive view [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5014.58s)]
*  on executive power, at least when [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5017.12s)]
*  it comes to Republican presidents named Donald Trump. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5018.5199999999995s)]
*  Ding, ding, ding. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5020.68s)]
*  What do we know so far about their views on how much power [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5022.44s)]
*  the president can wield over the federal government, [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5027.32s)]
*  particularly civil servants and spending that's [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5029.599999999999s)]
*  been appropriated by Congress? [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5031.88s)]
*  Yeah, so I think those might be two areas where the court's [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5033.4s)]
*  views could diverge, because I think the Republican justices [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5037.08s)]
*  have evinced the view that presidents, in their view, [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5040.96s)]
*  should have the power to fire most people within the executive [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5044.96s)]
*  branch or at least a lot of people. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5049.88s)]
*  And so even though the law is right now that Congress [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5051.68s)]
*  can protect civil servants, the civil service, [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5054.84s)]
*  they can say the heads of the Federal Trade Commission [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5058.0s)]
*  and whatnot can't be fired without good cause, [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5060.8s)]
*  there is a decent chance that the Supreme Court will overrule [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5064.8s)]
*  those cases and change the law to allow Donald Trump to exert [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5068.64s)]
*  over the federal bureaucracy. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5073.28s)]
*  Now, on the issue of spending, I think [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5075.5199999999995s)]
*  that that is an instance where the court or at least [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5077.799999999999s)]
*  a majority of the justices are probably [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5080.639999999999s)]
*  going to say, no, presidents don't [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5082.5199999999995s)]
*  have the unilateral power, just a decline [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5084.28s)]
*  to spend money that Congress has appropriated. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5086.839999999999s)]
*  The constitutional text is clear. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5089.44s)]
*  Congress has the power of the purse. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5091.36s)]
*  This is not ambiguous. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5093.639999999999s)]
*  This is also clear from federal law, [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5095.599999999999s)]
*  after Richard Nixon attempted to impound federal funds [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5097.5599999999995s)]
*  that Congress had appropriated. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5101.12s)]
*  Congress wrote a law being like, no, knock it off. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5102.5199999999995s)]
*  You can't do that. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5104.64s)]
*  So these things are all pretty clear. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5105.64s)]
*  And so I think those might be two spaces where [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5107.84s)]
*  the court diverges. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5110.44s)]
*  And again, that gets back to your point [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5111.32s)]
*  where that still gives the executive branch an awful lot [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5112.8s)]
*  of power to unleash a lot of havoc, [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5115.36s)]
*  because if they replace the civil service, civil servants, [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5117.32s)]
*  with a bunch of 19-year-old douchebags [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5121.48s)]
*  and whatever else they're planning, [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5124.36s)]
*  the operation of the federal government [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5127.76s)]
*  is going to be vastly undermined. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5129.32s)]
*  All right, let's go to the dark place for a second. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5131.96s)]
*  You may be like, we haven't been in the dark place yet? [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5134.4s)]
*  Yeah, no, curious where this is going. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5136.639999999999s)]
*  Well, I've heard some people say, OK, what happens if the, [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5137.84s)]
*  in the minds of the Supreme Court, [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5144.639999999999s)]
*  they must be thinking, OK, if Trump just [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5146.16s)]
*  refuses to comply with a ruling or defies a court order, [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5149.08s)]
*  what recourse does the Supreme Court have? [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5156.04s)]
*  And if they think that the answer is not much at all, [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5159.88s)]
*  will they in advance be wary of delivering a ruling that they [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5164.48s)]
*  think Trump will defy, in which case it's [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5169.72s)]
*  functionally the same thing? [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5173.6s)]
*  Yes, so a few things. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5175.0s)]
*  There are some things that they can do. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5177.44s)]
*  They can try to hold officials in contempt. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5180.12s)]
*  That involves basically sending out the US marshals [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5182.48s)]
*  to haul these people before the court and potentially in jail. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5185.32s)]
*  A slight problem with that is who controls the US marshals, [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5188.88s)]
*  the executive branch. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5191.88s)]
*  Second is, I think they can hope, [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5194.08s)]
*  and I think that they should hope, [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5196.12s)]
*  that there are enough people in Congress and elsewhere who [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5197.5199999999995s)]
*  would be so horrified by the idea [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5200.92s)]
*  that the executive branch would not [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5203.12s)]
*  comply with an order telling the executive branch just [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5204.599999999999s)]
*  to comply with the law, that this could actually [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5208.2s)]
*  lead to a fissure within the Republican coalition [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5211.679999999999s)]
*  and lead to some internal checks within the Republican party, which [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5214.56s)]
*  seem to be the only or a particularly important mechanism [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5218.280000000001s)]
*  of pushing back on Donald Trump. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5224.04s)]
*  And so those are some possibilities. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5225.8s)]
*  But I think it is a very real risk that the court is [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5227.88s)]
*  going to look at all these cases and wonder which ones is he not [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5230.04s)]
*  going to listen to us on. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5234.280000000001s)]
*  And in fact, if you go back to one of the very earliest, [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5235.400000000001s)]
*  most foundational constitutional cases, Marbury versus Madison, [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5237.88s)]
*  that is the case where the Supreme Court said, [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5240.88s)]
*  we can declare an act of Congress unconstitutional [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5243.44s)]
*  and decline to enforce a federal law. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5245.839999999999s)]
*  The federal government, they didn't even [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5247.679999999999s)]
*  show up at the Supreme Court to defend their position. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5249.24s)]
*  And Chief Justice Marshall and the other justices [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5251.919999999999s)]
*  were rightfully wary about whether the executive branch would [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5253.919999999999s)]
*  comply with the decision. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5257.24s)]
*  And so he kind of wrote it such that he didn't actually [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5258.639999999999s)]
*  require the executive branch to do much at all, [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5262.04s)]
*  even in the course of reaffirming the court's power. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5265.16s)]
*  And so I think what you are positing [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5268.36s)]
*  is a very real concern that the Supreme Court is [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5271.16s)]
*  going to be worried about whether this executive branch is [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5274.76s)]
*  going to comply with all of their court orders. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5277.96s)]
*  And so maybe they would budget their capital [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5279.88s)]
*  or at least ask on what issues would a decision striking down [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5282.68s)]
*  what the administration has done allow us to kind of be [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5287.24s)]
*  aligned with, let's say, Republican senators [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5292.2s)]
*  or super majority of the American people. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5294.639999999999s)]
*  And maybe that is an issue or a lens [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5297.84s)]
*  that they are approaching these cases with. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5302.16s)]
*  I mean, there's a recent potential example of this, [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5304.2s)]
*  even though it may seem smaller scale, which is like, [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5307.280000000001s)]
*  it seems like the Trump and the DOJ [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5310.08s)]
*  are just ignoring the Supreme Court's ruling [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5312.52s)]
*  on the TikTok ban, which is like they've given themselves [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5315.280000000001s)]
*  an extension to get some kind of a deal done. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5319.0s)]
*  The law says an extension is only [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5320.84s)]
*  allowed if there are already, quote, [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5322.4800000000005s)]
*  binding legal agreements in place for TikTok [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5324.24s)]
*  to divest of Chinese ownership, which there are not. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5326.76s)]
*  There is not a deal in the offing. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5329.24s)]
*  They're not just figuring out crossing the T's, [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5331.0s)]
*  dotting the I's, negotiating and needing an extension for that. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5333.2s)]
*  So is that right, first of all? [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5335.76s)]
*  And why does no one seem to care about this? [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5337.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so it's so weird there isn't a deal, [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5339.6s)]
*  because we were told Donald Trump is a consummate deal [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5342.04s)]
*  maker. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5344.08s)]
*  Best deal maker. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5344.56s)]
*  And we're able to work the shout out immediately. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5345.280000000001s)]
*  So I actually think that example is a little bit different [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5347.88s)]
*  than the worst case scenario we were talking about, [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5350.88s)]
*  because the Supreme Court in that decision, [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5353.2s)]
*  what they said is this law is constitutional. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5356.36s)]
*  They did not purport to require the president to do something [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5359.839999999999s)]
*  or prohibit the president from doing something. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5363.32s)]
*  And so the president is not technically [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5365.36s)]
*  in violation of the court order. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5367.719999999999s)]
*  Now, what he is in violation of is the federal law itself, [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5369.759999999999s)]
*  what Congress has said. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5373.679999999999s)]
*  And that's, going back to what I was suggesting earlier, [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5375.12s)]
*  that too is a constitutional crisis. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5377.599999999999s)]
*  Presidents do not have the power just [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5379.36s)]
*  to say that federal law is optional. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5381.0s)]
*  No one has to listen to that one. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5383.44s)]
*  That's a problem too. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5384.96s)]
*  But it's a little bit different than the situation [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5386.68s)]
*  we're imagining, which is whether he would actually [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5389.28s)]
*  defy a court order. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5391.84s)]
*  And no one has brought suit saying, hey, this is a law. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5393.36s)]
*  The president is not in compliance with this law. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5396.36s)]
*  What are you going to do about it? [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5398.28s)]
*  Like, that just hasn't happened yet. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5399.24s)]
*  OK. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5400.52s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5400.8s)]
*  Obviously, a lot of Americans aren't paying much attention [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5401.44s)]
*  to what Trump's doing to the federal government. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5403.24s)]
*  And I'm sure one response from people [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5405.08s)]
*  to Trump trying to fire government prosecutors, [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5406.68s)]
*  lawyers, FBI agents who aren't loyal is, well, [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5409.4s)]
*  maybe that's bad. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5412.24s)]
*  But like, you know, he's the president. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5412.92s)]
*  Maybe he should get to hire the people he wants. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5414.36s)]
*  Can you talk about why what's happening specifically [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5416.96s)]
*  at DOJ and FBI should alarm someone [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5419.599999999999s)]
*  who doesn't happen to be on Trump's enemies list? [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5423.12s)]
*  So the Department of Justice is reportedly instituting [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5427.679999999999s)]
*  these loyalty tests, asking people, [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5433.32s)]
*  do you believe the 2020 election is stolen and whatnot, [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5436.0s)]
*  and using that as kind of litmus tests. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5439.36s)]
*  And I think it is extremely dangerous [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5441.12s)]
*  to have a federal law enforcement apparatus that [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5445.08s)]
*  is all loyalists, right? [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5447.92s)]
*  No people who are going to provide [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5449.72s)]
*  any measure of dissent or counter views [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5452.44s)]
*  or any sort of independent views. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5455.36s)]
*  And again, I think you just have to look [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5458.68s)]
*  at how the federal government has been operating until now [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5460.8s)]
*  and what they are doing with the Doge Bros, right? [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5464.72s)]
*  Do you want them to be able to replace the people who [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5467.76s)]
*  have insured your Medicare payments, right, are issued? [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5470.72s)]
*  The people who are insuring that the Medicaid system is [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5473.84s)]
*  functioning. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5476.72s)]
*  The people who are insuring, right, the child care centers [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5477.6s)]
*  get the support that they need. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5480.12s)]
*  The people who are insuring that student loan payments actually [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5481.56s)]
*  are forgiven, like we're allowed. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5485.320000000001s)]
*  The people who are insuring, right, [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5486.96s)]
*  you can actually pay your taxes online, right? [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5489.4400000000005s)]
*  Those are things that federal bureaucrats do. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5492.0s)]
*  And if you replace all of those people [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5494.72s)]
*  with a bunch of hacks, right, who don't believe in government, [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5497.28s)]
*  right, and are like freshmen at Northeastern who [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5500.719999999999s)]
*  go buy big balls, like those things [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5503.719999999999s)]
*  are not going to get done. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5506.44s)]
*  Like when people who are 18, like they can't even [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5507.48s)]
*  get up at 8 AM in the morning, right? [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5509.84s)]
*  Like these are not the people, right, [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5511.84s)]
*  that you want running the basic services that allow all of us [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5513.88s)]
*  to function and live our lives. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5519.32s)]
*  Yeah, or when they say things like, oh, don't worry, [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5521.12s)]
*  we're going to replace all of the Indian Americans with AI [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5525.84s)]
*  and send them back and normalize Indian hate, [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5529.4800000000005s)]
*  you know, it might cause you to wonder, [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5532.32s)]
*  are they going to prioritize government services [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5534.24s)]
*  for certain people and not others? [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5536.52s)]
*  Yes, indeed. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5538.76s)]
*  You might wonder that. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5540.16s)]
*  And that's part of what we are seeing, right, [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5541.8s)]
*  and worried about when you look at what DOGE [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5545.56s)]
*  and they are doing as far as whittling down [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5548.96s)]
*  parts of the federal government. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5552.92s)]
*  They have disbanded portions of the Department of Justice [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5554.08s)]
*  that were designed to go after Russian oligarchs, right? [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5557.64s)]
*  They have disbanded parts of the Department of Justice [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5560.88s)]
*  that were designed to go after major corruption. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5564.5199999999995s)]
*  And they are suspending investigations into, [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5568.4s)]
*  for example, like what Elon Musk is up to at SpaceX [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5571.68s)]
*  and his other companies. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5575.4s)]
*  So yes, right, again, if you put in a bunch of hack loyalists [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5576.5199999999995s)]
*  into the federal government, they [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5580.48s)]
*  are not going to be applying the laws equally. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5581.72s)]
*  They are not going to be providing benefits equally. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5583.48s)]
*  And that too is, again, just antithetical to how [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5585.799999999999s)]
*  our system is supposed to work. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5589.48s)]
*  Last question. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5590.719999999999s)]
*  Maybe the worst thing Trump did over the weekend [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5592.4s)]
*  doesn't even have to do with the law. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5594.48s)]
*  I know what you're going to say. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5596.24s)]
*  He said he was rooting for the chiefs, [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5598.28s)]
*  praised Brittany Mahomes, only to then attack Taylor Swift [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5601.759999999999s)]
*  for getting booed by Philly fans. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5607.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, I just feel like it was a real bummer of a postscript [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5609.5199999999995s)]
*  on the errors tour, just this whole way everything ended. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5612.64s)]
*  It was. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5616.08s)]
*  And yet I am choosing to take a longer view of this. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5617.280000000001s)]
*  Because one of the last people Taylor Swift [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5620.96s)]
*  got into a major feud with was Kanye West. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5624.320000000001s)]
*  How's he doing now? [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5627.240000000001s)]
*  I'm just waiting. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5628.72s)]
*  He had a tough weekend. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5629.4800000000005s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5630.52s)]
*  I'm just waiting for her to pull a Kendrick Lamar on him [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5631.52s)]
*  as her Drake. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5636.92s)]
*  Maybe reputation, Taylor's version when it comes out, [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5638.12s)]
*  will have some of this. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5641.6s)]
*  The original was a Kanye Kim thing. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5643.56s)]
*  Maybe this will be Trump. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5646.120000000001s)]
*  Or this is the secret hidden album Karma, [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5648.04s)]
*  where she just unleashes karma on him. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5650.8s)]
*  All right, see, we needed to end this with some hope [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5653.0s)]
*  and optimism. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5655.52s)]
*  Leah, thank you so much for joining us as always. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5656.56s)]

*  All right, before we wrap, we do have a couple of news stories [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5668.08s)]
*  that broke while we were recording. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5670.88s)]
*  Trump has signed an executive order [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KemfL_4lXuw&t=5672.72s)]
