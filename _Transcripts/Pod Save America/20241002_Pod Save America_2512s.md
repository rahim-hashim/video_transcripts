Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Tim Walz Clashes With JD Vance in VP Debate Over Women's Rights, 2020 Election and Immigration
**Pod Save America:** [October 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM)
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Jon Favreau. I'm Jon Lovett. I'm Dan Pfeiffer. Tommy Vitor. Okay, let's get right to it [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=0.0s)]
*  We just watched the vice presidential debate together here in LA to quote the moderators Margaret Brennan and Nora O'Donnell [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=5.36s)]
*  Gentlemen, we have a lot to get through [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=12.0s)]
*  We're gonna start with the only thing that truly matters [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=15.96s)]
*  What did the insta reaction polls say very scientific? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  Take them as gospel [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=23.2s)]
*  And basically they're all tied [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=24.88s)]
*  So it's high debate [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=27.16s)]
*  I'm not gonna go through all the numbers but that's what they all said and even the focus groups the undecided voters [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=28.32s)]
*  They were mostly tied [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=33.28s)]
*  there was one undecided voter who I was about to say in this debate like [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  The one thing I could say about this debate is that no one made up their mind based on this debate not true [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=38.64s)]
*  There was an undecided voter in Michigan who said they're voting for he's voting for Kamala Harris now based on [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=43.379999999999995s)]
*  This debate because of JD Vance's answer on January 6th, which we're gonna talk about in a bit [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=48.8s)]
*  So that one person plucked from all is making us all feel like everything's gonna be okay fine, right? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=53.2s)]
*  It looks like you know CBS also did favorability ratings. It looks like both walls and Vance their favorability improved [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=58.68000000000001s)]
*  Based on this debate all of that said we got our own panel of undecided voters right here [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=66.0s)]
*  What did you all think I think the meta narrative coming out of tonight will be this respectful tone and the fact that it kind [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=73.04s)]
*  Of reminded people of normal political discourse you saw that in some of the focus groups. They're like, oh these people seem nice [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=79.84s)]
*  They were nice to each other. They talked they didn't work disrespectful [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=84.16s)]
*  I thought it was interesting that JD Vance went into tonight doing the media head fake being like I'm gonna savage him about lying about [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=87.7s)]
*  His military service then he did none of that. He was conspicuously nice to Tim Walls. He praised him constantly. He agreed with him [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=94.12s)]
*  And so, you know, it's like hard watching these debates not to let your gut reaction be entirely [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=101.68s)]
*  Grating it on style points and walls seemed a little nervous at the top, which is totally understandable [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=108.0s)]
*  It's his first debate on the national stage and the first question was like would you bomb Iran? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=112.64s)]
*  You know, he's a fucking Minnesota governor. That's not his comfort zone [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=117.44000000000001s)]
*  But he smoothed it out as he went he sometimes speaks in sentence fragments [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=121.4s)]
*  He had some answers that were a little hard to follow [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=125.08000000000001s)]
*  There was the China question that we'll talk about that was probably his worst night answer tonight [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=127.04s)]
*  There were a few times I think all of us were yelling at the TV being like say this but you know [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=131.0s)]
*  He was you want a different path [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=135.32s)]
*  Yes [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=137.4s)]
*  It's a really strong moment. So on health care abortion access gun violence [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=138.6s)]
*  And his best moment was the close with that January 6 question that again we'll get into so I think [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=143.24s)]
*  JD Vance was like smooth and polished and clearly like the guy who was in debate club [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  But it's not clear to me that that necessarily plays well with the voters or that he did much for Trump tonight [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=152.72s)]
*  He's ultimately what people will remember out of this debate will be like one moment [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=158.16s)]
*  It will probably be this January 6th clip that we will talk about later in the show [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=161.96s)]
*  The agreeable Tommy the I too was moved by the tone of the debate [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=167.4s)]
*  Was crying I [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=173.08s)]
*  Tried to set up a drink with Mitch McConnell afterwards [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=176.0s)]
*  Well head into the red ham after this [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=180.36s)]
*  Put aside the tone. What was interesting about it really was sort of a pre Trump debate [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=183.16s)]
*  It was a debate that it could have been Romney Obama in 2012. It could have been [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=187.64000000000001s)]
*  Obama McCain it just it was pre Trump in two ways one [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=194.16s)]
*  No one was screaming at the other person or stalking around or doing incredibly weird shit, which try happens in Trump debates [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=198.28s)]
*  But also there no one really tried to have a whole bunch of trying to give each other Kovac [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=204.16s)]
*  And there weren't a lot of like lines and Zink or set up for social media [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=213.88s)]
*  Like there weren't all the debates go even going back to 2012 or sort of like reverse engineers from these moments [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=218.8s)]
*  you would try to get they could then go viral on whatever the social platform was of the election cycle and [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=224.28s)]
*  neither the candidates really either tried to execute that or did execute it and so really was just sort of a [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=230.04000000000002s)]
*  Two guys talking to each other. I do think that [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=235.28s)]
*  There is this huge gap between how the pundits assessed [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=239.24s)]
*  Vance's performance and how the voters did and it I think it speaks to the ways in the incorrect ways in which pundits judge debates [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=242.76s)]
*  We do they are I mean media folks are all probably members of the same debate club that JD Vance was [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=250.23999999999998s)]
*  They judge it on that on points and style and poise and language precision and voters are just kind of looking at it [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=255.16s)]
*  Just got get some information make a big decision and on that front [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=261.53999999999996s)]
*  I think wall scored more points than the initial pun it reactions suggested that he did [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=264.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's funny that you say it feels like a pre-trump debate because what I was thinking and while watching it is that it [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=269.44s)]
*  Actually feels like a post Trump. I was just gonna say that [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=274.76s)]
*  because that I don't believe there's a post Trump well, I just like that that that [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=277.8s)]
*  There was I think like JD Vance is obviously hyper ambitious [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=284.0s)]
*  He's doing all of this for his own benefits completely adapted to Donald Trump [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=288.36s)]
*  But you kind of saw that play out I think in an unexpected way [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=292.64s)]
*  Which is that a lot of what this debate felt like to me was JD Vance repairing JD Vance's image, right? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=294.96s)]
*  He didn't want to be the attack version of JD Vance. He articulated more his philosophies. He has thoughts on Finland [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=301.71999999999997s)]
*  Oh, you brought up Finland. I have thoughts about about gun safety in Finland. I have actually a very very [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=307.68s)]
*  Sophisticated views on family policy. He took walls as Finland bait [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=313.79999999999995s)]
*  But and then and we'll get to I think some of the ways that I think affects the race which is how he tried to [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=319.32s)]
*  Defend a version of Trump that doesn't exist, but it really was I think you see what? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=323.52s)]
*  Jade what JD Vance felt like he was doing up there was this is how I wish Donald Trump existed [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=330.15999999999997s)]
*  This is the kind of politics [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=334.91999999999996s)]
*  I wish I was free to be able to practice without having to fend to fend Donald Trump's words and deeds and I think that [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=336.08s)]
*  Will do a lot to repair JD Vance's image as a weird dipshit [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=341.52s)]
*  Yeah, but I don't know that ultimately like oh some on style points JD Vance landed some punches [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=345.71999999999997s)]
*  How does that help Trump it doesn't matter how people come away seeing these two figures it was who articulated a better case for? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=351.04s)]
*  Kamala versus Trump and I think Tim Walls had that as his plan and JD Vance. I don't think as much did I [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=356.32s)]
*  Was not surprised by JD Vance's performance like the guy loves to argue has no problem lying [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=363.92s)]
*  Clearly has no shame since he's Donald Trump's running mate after calling him America's Hitler [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=370.72s)]
*  I also think [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=376.40000000000003s)]
*  Love it you always talk about Trump's [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=379.03999999999996s)]
*  Intellectual Zamboni's yeah, this is like [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=381.23999999999995s)]
*  In the intellectual Zamboni is Trump says something crazy and then some pundit at the national national review like Hugh [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=384.2s)]
*  He would usually you cue it usually comes in and there's like actually a theory in an intellectual case behind that it's all bullshit [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=390.84s)]
*  That's like the job JD Vance has been running for ever since he went from being a never trumper to a trumper [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=396.32s)]
*  And I also think that like for most of JD Vance's career [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=401.84s)]
*  He went from trying to impress the center-right center-left [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=405.52s)]
*  Establishment as a never trumper to then arguing with them and fighting with them as a as a trumper and so he knows how to [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=410.64s)]
*  impress [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=418.2s)]
*  The establishment which is what he tried to do tonight like he tried to he tried to perform [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=419.24s)]
*  A normal version of JD Vance, and I think he was he was relatively good at that again because he was able to [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=424.44s)]
*  Lie a lot yeah, it's sort of why like as the debate was wrapping up [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=431.03999999999996s)]
*  I think I think walls got better as the debate went on and his best moment was in the very end of the debate [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=435.28s)]
*  But I walked away with this feeling did I just watch something where I like I was like [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=440.88s)]
*  what is this feeling I'm having and do I trust it and I like [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=444.4s)]
*  we are the kind of people that are [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=449.32s)]
*  like kind of naturally inclined to like watch a debate based on points to like be to like be impressed by style to be [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=451.36s)]
*  Impressed by clean articulation and like this is sort of I think been a fault of ours when we went back to the 2020 [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=458.0s)]
*  Debates and not seeing when like kind of being worried about Joe Biden [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=463.16s)]
*  But actually Joe Biden appealing to people that are coming to it in a different way [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=466.18s)]
*  And I feel like that was my hope coming out of the debate that actually if you look at like maybe JD Vance is I think [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=469.32s)]
*  A little bit tighter of a debater [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=475.02s)]
*  But walls is more genuine a little bit more heartfelt a little bit more real even if he stumbles now and again he kind of [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=477.1s)]
*  Delivers something in a way that's more persuasive and I and I think that that ultimately is why it looks like a draw [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=482.04s)]
*  I also think JD Vance just highlighted that his running mate is [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=486.52s)]
*  Deranged and has deteriorated and should never be president like I don't know [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=492.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm sure that's not what he intended [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=496.2s)]
*  But I think the effect of this debate on some people who watched who may be undecided and I don't again [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=498.03999999999996s)]
*  I don't think it probably moved a lot of people [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=502.64s)]
*  But they're like, oh, well, Donald Trump wasn't like that. He's saying all the things [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=505.32s)]
*  He's got all the positions that Donald Trump has but he sounds he doesn't sound like a maniac [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=509.64s)]
*  Yeah, so I don't know if that really helps Donald Trump and I don't know if Donald Trump even though he's seemingly happy with the performance [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=514.26s)]
*  Is gonna be really happy with the performance [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=521.54s)]
*  I'm like curious about the next 48 hours about like JD Vance taking the spotlight JD Vance saying that Tulsi and RFK jr [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=523.46s)]
*  Endors me vote for me. Like I think there's gonna be a little bit of Donald Trump like not liking this tall grass [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=529.78s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=534.9399999999999s)]
*  So we've been talking about the the big moment in the debate which came at the end [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=536.06s)]
*  It was the last exchange of the night the topic was democracy and Trump's responsibility for January 6. Let's listen Hillary Clinton in [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=540.9000000000001s)]
*  2016 said that Donald Trump had the election stolen by Vladimir Putin because the Russians bought like [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=548.5400000000001s)]
*  $500,000 worth of Facebook ads and if we want to say that we need to respect the results of the election [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=555.3000000000001s)]
*  I'm on board [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=560.1400000000001s)]
*  But if we want to say as Tim Walz is saying that this is just a problem that Republicans have had I don't buy that [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=561.1400000000001s)]
*  Governor January 6 was not Facebook ads [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=566.7s)]
*  This was a threat to our democracy in a way that we had not seen and it manifested itself because of Donald Trump's inability to say [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=568.94s)]
*  He is still saying he didn't lose the election. I would just ask that did he lose the 2020 election Tim? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=576.14s)]
*  I'm focused on the future. Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their mind in the wake of the 2020? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=582.14s)]
*  COVID situation that is a damning that is a damning non-answer. So America [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=589.5s)]
*  So America, I think you've got a really clear choice on this election of who's gonna honor that democracy and who's gonna honor Donald Trump [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=593.58s)]
*  So all the the dial groups the Harris campaign dial groups other undecided voters [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=601.82s)]
*  All agreed that that was the worst moment for JD Vance [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=606.58s)]
*  I think not only because it was an obvious lie, but because he sounded like a fucking politician. I'm focused on the future [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=609.66s)]
*  There's nothing I don't think there's anything worse. You could have said that I'm focused on the future. Yeah, slippery [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=616.06s)]
*  Smarmy ridiculous line. Yeah, it would have honestly been better if he was like he did win that election [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=620.9399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I stand by it. Yeah, how much you guys think that matters Dan? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=626.8399999999999s)]
*  I mean to the extent that anything matters in this debate [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=631.12s)]
*  I think it matters more than anything else and you have [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=633.78s)]
*  the big lie is a signifier of extremism for most voters in polling generally a [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=637.02s)]
*  Six in ten voters believe Joe Biden legitimately won the election that number is higher among independents [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=644.14s)]
*  Right the exact undecided voters were talking about they do not think that the election was stolen [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=649.14s)]
*  And they think it's really fucking weird that Donald Trump is still talking about that [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=654.9s)]
*  Four years later and JD Vance being unable to answer the question the most [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=658.18s)]
*  Blatant way possible just might as well hold up a sign that says I'm a smarmy politician when you answer the question the way [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=662.38s)]
*  He did is [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=667.54s)]
*  Certainly not helpful to the cause. Yeah, it's not the size of the lies the motion in the ocean [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=668.7399999999999s)]
*  I think this will get shared on the aforementioned Facebook [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=673.2199999999999s)]
*  Twitter [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=677.42s)]
*  I was gonna go to time. I'm like Tommy's got the face. He's about to say something [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=678.98s)]
*  No, I do it did come at the end, but I was like, you know, I can have [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=685.1800000000001s)]
*  Second time I've done that in two pods [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=691.2600000000001s)]
*  It was still not over the people to chest. I know I've heard about that [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=694.3800000000001s)]
*  Tim Miller grades all of our podcast episodes and tells us when we did good and he really liked that one [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=699.1400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, just flagging it. Uh, yes, so it was at the very end of the debate was elastic change [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=703.94s)]
*  But it seems like in this media environment, it could be the clip that defines the debate. It could be though [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=707.94s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. I mean certainly that's what the Harris walls campaigns gonna want to do [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=713.4200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but I think that so far in the media coverage we've seen [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=716.7800000000001s)]
*  Before recording it seems like that's gonna be the big moment [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=720.62s)]
*  Yeah [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=723.1400000000001s)]
*  and I also would say probably like if you if we're just sort of trying to [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=723.6600000000001s)]
*  Be straight shooters here Tim Walls is like that is JD Vance's worst moment by far and it was the worst moment of the debate [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=727.0200000000001s)]
*  Tim Walls is worst moment was probably his answer that we'll get to on [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=733.62s)]
*  kind of [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=737.5799999999999s)]
*  When he when he was in China and like it was a bad and from freeing answer [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=739.98s)]
*  But it was an answer about him in a kind of strange and sort of personal way [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=744.34s)]
*  Like that answer goes to the heart of the case against Donald Trump. Well, let's talk about that [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=747.9s)]
*  Let's play that answer from from Tim Walls [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=752.26s)]
*  Governor just to follow up on that [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=754.78s)]
*  The question was can you explain the no just frequency? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=756.86s)]
*  All I said on this was is I got there that summer and misspoke on this so I I will just [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=760.5799999999999s)]
*  That's what I've said [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=765.72s)]
*  So I was in [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=768.08s)]
*  Hong Kong and China during the democracy protests went in and from that I learned a lot of what needed to be in in governance [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=770.6s)]
*  Tommy before you get into like whether that was good or bad or how bad that was or whatever [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=779.0s)]
*  What was that all about? I couldn't even follow [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=783.96s)]
*  So I asked governor walls about this when I interviewed him back in February because I was at fault. Yeah, this is well partially [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=785.8000000000001s)]
*  I had read that he had been in China around the Tiananmen Square massacre, which occurred [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=791.92s)]
*  On June 4th, so I basically said like were you there during the protest in the Tiananmen Square massacre? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=798.4s)]
*  He said I was in Hong Kong. I was in Hong Kong what had happened [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=803.56s)]
*  I was in Hong Kong on June 4th when Tiananmen happened blah blah blah blah [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=806.22s)]
*  And it turns out that there's some reports from local Nebraska news outlets [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=809.92s)]
*  That say he was in Nebraska on May 16th and he didn't travel to Hong Kong until August of 1989 [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=814.56s)]
*  So a couple months after the protests he did go from Hong Kong into China. He did teach at a school [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=821.22s)]
*  He did set up this exchange program after and like try to build ties between US students and Chinese students [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=826.14s)]
*  I think what happened is he just kind of misremembered the story over the years [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=832.1600000000001s)]
*  Mistold it a few times and it just stuck in his brain wrong [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=836.5s)]
*  Like it that happens to people all the time our memories suck. We get things wrong all the time and [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=839.98s)]
*  I'm sure it was pretty uncomfortable for him. He didn't seem like totally well prepared [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=845.9s)]
*  He didn't just like explain it clearly kind of [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=850.5400000000001s)]
*  Told a bunch of bio and it was mostly confusing [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=853.74s)]
*  I'm guessing most people watching just couldn't really follow what was happening there [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=857.5s)]
*  I think maybe the maybe people will care [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=861.32s)]
*  I seriously doubt it if the Trump campaign decides to really drive this I guess they could make it a thing [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=863.82s)]
*  But like what a waste of time [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=867.94s)]
*  I mean I read the CNN story about it before the debate and then watched the exchange and I still couldn't follow exactly [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=869.0600000000001s)]
*  But I don't fault him for [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=877.14s)]
*  Misremembering because my memory is shit and I can't remember things that happened like two years ago and the stories and where I was I [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=880.62s)]
*  do think that they he knew this was coming and I would have just [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=886.94s)]
*  Been a little clearer on like, you know what? I got that wrong. I messed up and then just [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=891.34s)]
*  Been to China there were [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=896.94s)]
*  But I messed up yeah, yeah, I was saying as advice to all politicians. That's always the best answer [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=899.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, just if you made a mistake just own it and move on and be done with it and you're gonna have to answer it [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=904.86s)]
*  you can't just [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=911.5s)]
*  Like dance around it for a long time and hope the clock runs out. Yeah, I also like [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=912.8199999999999s)]
*  He did his so the opening question ended up being about foreign policy [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=918.42s)]
*  He answered that question Vance says before I get to your foreign policy question. I'm gonna do my bio [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=922.62s)]
*  Walls was looking for a place to kind of do his bio [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=928.8199999999999s)]
*  He realized about him talk about being a teacher so he does his bio so doesn't totally work [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=931.12s)]
*  So fine like it's not that it's not the way to articulate that first question just really threw her off [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=934.6s)]
*  Imagine you're just your biggest moment of your professional life [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=939.5600000000001s)]
*  You're debating you're the vice president's nominee in Iran launches 200 ballistic missiles at Israel the day before like and suddenly you haven't prepped for [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=942.88s)]
*  This you haven't prepared you haven't thought about what you'd say about this. I'm sure it was like a massive, you know [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=950.0s)]
*  Yeah wrench in their preparation, but but the point I want to make about is just like [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=954.5600000000001s)]
*  It's very much now kind of like bubbling on the hyper online, right that like Tim Walz is [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=958.48s)]
*  Like doesn't tell the truth [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=964.56s)]
*  he's a serial liar serial exaggerator because he like like because they try to [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=965.88s)]
*  mischaracterize how he responded when he talked about his his family using fertility treatments and a few and how they kind of have like [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=970.36s)]
*  Exaggerated about how he's described his service and tried to lie and malign him for how he's talked about his service [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=976.8s)]
*  And I I do think that like if that's what they want to focus on [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=982.0s)]
*  Like trying to paint him walls in this way, like I just don't think it works [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=984.44s)]
*  I don't think it's viable like he just comes on honest and straight-furthy guy and they should be focusing Kamala Harris and they're defending [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=987.32s)]
*  The world's greatest liar. So I just think the whole thing is ultimately small and stupid. Also JD Vance's entire life is a lie [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=993.28s)]
*  There's that he I never got to the end of that book though, but whatever happened they found him in that manger [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1001.12s)]
*  Yeah, I was I my critique of Tim Walz was less about that more I just think he had some missed opportunities [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1007.88s)]
*  right and I think that he he you could tell when he I hadn't noticed this before but [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1014.28s)]
*  Whether it was anxiety or what? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1019.36s)]
*  He was nervous [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1021.32s)]
*  But he like he jumps to the next thought and there were sentence fragments and he didn't quite complete the thought [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1022.2s)]
*  Sometimes it was hard to follow exactly what he was saying and like even in the January 6th, which was his best answer [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1026.64s)]
*  During that exchange. I was like, why isn't he talking about Donald Trump wanting to pardon the insurrectionists? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1032.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's the that's the most unpopular policy that he has and it's about moving forward [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1038.0s)]
*  You want to focus on the future JD Vance your running mate wants to pardon the people who beat up cops [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1042.2s)]
*  So Jay, so Tim Walz you take these lessons and when you're debating Marjorie Taylor Greene in four years [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1047.88s)]
*  And you can be a little bit more on top of this but he was was much better than that on a lot of the other [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1054.5600000000002s)]
*  answers [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1060.0s)]
*  he [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1061.0s)]
*  Reproductive rights. He was really strong just like the campaign's been doing in ads and at the convention [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1062.74s)]
*  He talked about the individual stories of women who've been injured or lost their lives because of their state's abortion bans [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1067.76s)]
*  Let's listen if you don't know Amanda or a Hadley you soon will their project [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1073.24s)]
*  2025 is gonna have a registry of pregnancies [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1079.3200000000002s)]

*  That's nobody else's business, but those things are being proposed and the catch-all on this is is well [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1096.26s)]
*  The states will decide what's right for Texas might not be right for Washington. That's not how this works [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1103.1s)]

*  We are ranked first in health care for a reason we trust women we trust doctors [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1120.98s)]
*  Donald Trump has been very clear that on the abortion policy specifically that we have a big country and it's diverse and [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1125.0600000000002s)]
*  California has a different viewpoint on this than Georgia Georgia has a different viewpoint from Arizona and the proper way to handle this as [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1132.66s)]
*  Messy as democracy sometimes is is to let voters make these decisions [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1140.22s)]
*  Let the individual states make their abortion policy. How can we as a nation? [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1145.5s)]
*  Say that your life and your rights as basic as the right to control your own body is [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1150.4199999999998s)]
*  Determined on geography. I thought the geography thing was a great [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1157.86s)]
*  response to Vance because clearly it was walls had his prepared first answer there but then going back and hitting them on geography because [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1162.3s)]
*  He did California and Georgia was I thought really strong. What'd you guys think of that? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1168.3799999999999s)]
*  It was incredibly strong answer. It's right [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1172.46s)]
*  It fits with exactly how all the polling says you should talk about this all the message testing says [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1174.8999999999999s)]
*  The the ads and the speeches and the messages that lead with people's personal stories are by far the most powerful [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1179.56s)]
*  It gets at freedom the geography line undermines Trump's state's argument, which is really important and [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1185.3999999999999s)]
*  The Harris campaign has been hammering that Trump and Vance on abortion for months now and it is working, right? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1192.3999999999999s)]
*  We are seeing in polls increases in the number of voters who think Trump would pass a federal abortion ban who think he's personally [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1198.9199999999998s)]
*  Anti-choice who thinks that abortion rights are actually at stake if he's on the ballot and that matters because in those blue wall states in the [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1205.6799999999998s)]
*  New York Times, Siena poll that came out over the weekend abortion is the second issue by far and [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1212.7199999999998s)]
*  And so make raising the silence of that issue and driving home and pushing on that advantage is incredibly important [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1218.52s)]
*  So this was this is also goes to the point that [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1224.28s)]
*  JD Vance scored points in the debate on things that don't matter and where walls was at its best was on the exact things that [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1226.3999999999999s)]
*  Matter to voters like reproductive freedom Tommy. What did you think of Vance's? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1231.84s)]
*  He kept bringing up we have to earn voters trust on this issue [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1236.28s)]
*  It seemed like he was trying to soften the edges of the typical Trump Republican answer and Vance answer on abortion because he has had some [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1239.84s)]
*  Really wacky things. Yeah, I mean, I guess it folded into his broader strategy of like hey, I'm just a good guy [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1247.96s)]
*  I feel your pain. Let's agree to disagree and find common ground [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1253.3s)]
*  But like I don't know earn your trust on this issue [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1256.08s)]
*  What does that mean to someone who lives in a state where women are dying because they can't get a [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1259.28s)]
*  abortion care, you know, it's just it did not I don't I don't think it's gonna work for them [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1264.72s)]
*  He also lied about saying he never supported a national abortion ban JD Vance absolutely supported [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1268.56s)]
*  This is the CBS polling on the issues showed that governor walls did way better than JD Vance [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1273.1200000000001s)]
*  In terms of voters the response when talking about abortion and health care [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1278.56s)]
*  Yeah [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1282.76s)]
*  the that was also another moment where was much more about himself like he was talking about what he'd said in the past and [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1283.08s)]
*  His own views on abortion. I also do think like it was [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1288.48s)]
*  Like one of Tim waltz's best moments in the debate [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1292.24s)]
*  But to the point John was making was also moment say like, you know earn people's trust [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1294.68s)]
*  You're for a national abortion ban. You're you you've had this you you said Donald Trump [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1298.28s)]
*  Would veto it he now say he wouldn't back you on that [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1303.04s)]
*  Like there was there were places where you could like I think you're running me [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1305.68s)]
*  It says that women should be punished, right? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1308.04s)]
*  So the women should be punished for abortion like the whole point your position is that you don't trust women [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1309.96s)]
*  Yeah, why should they trust you potty of America is brought to you by zip recruiter friends [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1314.2s)]
*  It's that time again when we must choose who we think is the best candidate for office [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1318.32s)]
*  But really choosing the right candidate for any office is a huge undertaking [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1321.8s)]
*  Whether the office is a classroom a stage a stadium the cab of a bulldozer or even the inside of a toll booth [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1326.08s)]

*  Clearly unsurprisingly Vance went into the debate wanting to make every single answer about immigration [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1371.98s)]
*  Here are some of the key exchanges people with stable housing end up with stable jobs [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1376.72s)]
*  People with stable housing have their kids able to be able to get to school all of those things in the long run [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1381.16s)]
*  End up saving our money, and that's the thing that I think we should be able to find some common ground in but we can't blame [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1386.8s)]
*  Immigrants for the only reason that's not the case. It's happening in many cities [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1394.52s)]
*  Tim just said something that I agree with we don't want to blame immigrants for higher housing prices [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1398.24s)]
*  But we do want to blame Kamala Harris for letting in millions of illegal aliens into this country which does drive up cost him [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1402.74s)]
*  25 million illegal aliens competing with Americans for scarce homes is one of the most significant drivers of home prices [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1411.66s)]
*  And just to clarify for our viewers Springfield, Ohio does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1418.64s)]
*  temporary protected [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1427.22s)]
*  We have so much to get to [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1430.22s)]
*  The rules were that you got a fact check and since you're [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1435.22s)]
*  It's important to say what's actually going on the rules were no fact-checking no fair [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1439.26s)]
*  We I'm supposed to be able to lie the whole time. I wouldn't have agreed to this debate if I know those me fact-checking [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1444.5s)]
*  Anyone believe that immigration is why housing costs are high is that credible to anybody no it's I mean [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1450.38s)]
*  The there is a case that in Springfield [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1457.7s)]
*  because [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1460.98s)]
*  Many of the Haitian immigrants were living together are living together in houses like five or six of them in a house [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1462.54s)]
*  Who have come here that it was making? [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1468.86s)]
*  housing too expensive for like a family of two who lived in Springfield and they were driving houses because they could live in a [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1471.82s)]
*  House more people could live in one house sure I know this is like a whole long thing once you have the legal [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1478.1399999999999s)]
*  migrants legal migrants right yeah, but again [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1482.6599999999999s)]
*  you know and walls and and and Vance had this exchange to about housing like [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1486.02s)]
*  JD Vance and Donald Trump have no housing plan [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1491.62s)]
*  They had no plan to reduce the cost of housing if all the Haitian migrants that are there legally left Springfield tomorrow [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1493.8999999999999s)]
*  housing prices in Springfield and all across the country would still be way too high and they have no plan except to [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1499.54s)]
*  Buy some federal land and build a house on a park somewhere and deport people right yeah [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1505.1399999999999s)]
*  Yes, how do you guys think you did on immigration you think you think Vance scored some points there? [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1511.4199999999998s)]
*  I [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1515.26s)]
*  Get I mean, I don't know I like [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1516.5s)]
*  It was um obviously it's like a better issue for him [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1519.1s)]
*  I think walls I think did a good job when he [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1522.1s)]
*  Talked about Donald Trump standing in the way of the bill so that was a good moment for him [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1526.06s)]
*  And he had been heating up by the time we got to that part of the debate [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1530.1799999999998s)]
*  So I think it probably is yet another place where it like kind of battles to a draw [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1532.6599999999999s)]
*  I don't know that people buy all this [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1536.6599999999999s)]
*  Anti-immigrant stuff from Vance that that moment where he said I'm not blaming migrants for the cost of housing [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1538.8999999999999s)]
*  I'm blaming Kamala Harris like I feel like that has to read people as absurd like people have people are you know? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1542.54s)]
*  This housing problem is a very old and long-growing problem [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1548.58s)]
*  It's not something that began under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris a generational failure [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1551.58s)]
*  People were coming in under Donald Trump and Barack Obama and George W [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1556.1599999999999s)]
*  Bush like I don't I just the idea that you're gonna lay this [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1559.42s)]
*  If they keep even keep referring to it as the Kamala Harris [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1561.26s)]
*  Administrator like just it just I just don't think people buy it. Yeah, yeah, I agree with I just this is true in all things [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1564.02s)]
*  Immigration they keep saying Kamala Harris let them in the country let these people bring fentanyl in the country people don't think the vice president [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1569.62s)]
*  Can do that. It's just simply not it's absurd president [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1575.82s)]
*  You know is the commander-in-chief make some laws and then the vice president lets in fentanyl [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1580.22s)]
*  Has the full authority to just let in drugs at the board. Yeah, but actually, you know [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1585.8999999999999s)]
*  The vice president has one vote in the Senate same as JD Vance, right? [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1590.98s)]
*  Like where's JD Vance is record JD Vance had the like audacity up there like I think [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1594.46s)]
*  Republicans in the Congress let let Donald Trump down. You've been in the Congress, right? You haven't passed a bill [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1598.56s)]
*  You've nothing to your name. Yeah. Yeah, I appreciate it [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1603.02s)]
*  Governor was is like decency and in saying you're blaming migrants for everything and that's unfair and it's wrong [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1605.72s)]
*  It's egregious. I think you maybe spend a little too much time doing that [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1610.86s)]
*  I wanted him to pivot harder and go on attack of the strongest [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1613.3999999999999s)]
*  Messaging was when he talked about the bipartisan immigration bill that Republicans and Democrats came together to do in Congress and that Donald Trump tanked [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1617.36s)]
*  I do think Jane JD whining about the fact checks will be another thing that spins out on social media [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1624.5400000000002s)]
*  It'll be very useful for the Harris campaign in the future because JD famously says he likes to make up stories about immigration to advance [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1629.8600000000001s)]
*  His lies and agenda. So yeah, the CBS poll showed it was basically a draw on immigration though [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1636.3400000000001s)]
*  They favored Vance by a little bit [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1642.9s)]
*  Yeah [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1645.5800000000002s)]
*  I was I and [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1646.0600000000002s)]
*  Walls was trying to get there when he was talking about Springfield because he was like what happened to this community and the kid in the [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1647.5400000000002s)]
*  Bomb threats at school and stuff like that and and Vance jumped in and be like, oh you care about the immigrants [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1652.82s)]
*  You care about the migrants but not the people in Springfield and I do think that walls could have been you know [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1657.8999999999999s)]
*  There's an opportunity there [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1662.42s)]
*  I think for Harris and walls to be like this is like people in Springfield are not better off because JD Vance and [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1663.58s)]
*  Donald Trump have been running around saying that Haitian migrants are eating dogs and cats like they've had bomb threats like the [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1669.86s)]
*  People who live in Springfield who lived there for a long time like they're not better off because of this [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1676.34s)]
*  It's bullshit and like they're just trying to divide people against each other [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1680.78s)]
*  Like I do think there's an immigration message that you're right Tommy like talks about what what people are dealing with on both sides [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1684.46s)]
*  It's key go to all things right? It's January 6 and the big lie to it [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1690.1000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump and JD Vance will say or do anything that will get them powered no matter who it hurts [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1693.94s)]
*  Exactly, including the people who support them. Yeah, especially those people. Yeah [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1698.1000000000001s)]
*  So one area where Vance didn't have a great answer was on whether we should have more gun safety laws [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1703.18s)]
*  Listen and I say this not loving the answer because I don't want my kids to go to school and in a school that feels [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1708.72s)]
*  unsafe or where there are visible signs of security [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1716.1200000000001s)]
*  But I unfortunately think that we have to increase security in our schools. We have to make the doors lock better [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1718.76s)]
*  We have to make the doors stronger. We've got to make the windows stronger. Well, I think all the parents watching tonight [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1724.94s)]
*  this is just your biggest nightmare look I got a I got a 17 year old and and [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1730.4s)]
*  He witnessed a shooting at a community center playing volleyball. Those things don't leave you the NRA [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1735.08s)]
*  I was an array guy for a long time. They used to teach gun safety [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1740.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm of an age where my shotgun was in my car so I could pheasant hunt after football practice [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1743.3999999999999s)]
*  That's not where we live today [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1748.1599999999999s)]
*  This idea of stigmatizing mental health just because you have a mental health issue doesn't mean you're violent [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1749.6799999999998s)]
*  And I think what we end up doing is we start looking for a scapegoat [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1755.04s)]
*  Sometimes it just is the guns hearing it again. I think that might have been one of his best answers [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1758.76s)]
*  Yeah, because it also it was something he came back to there was a lot of kind of I don't know [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1763.52s)]
*  It was a little bit like have a kind of gauzy [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1767.6s)]
*  section of the debate when they were going back and forth on guns because JD Vance is like [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1771.0s)]
*  Oh god [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1774.58s)]
*  If only there was something someone to stop my policies from causing all of these problems [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1775.28s)]
*  Like there was a lot of like I hate that we have to harden our schools like they're fucking military barracks [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1779.36s)]
*  But there's just nothing we can do and I wanted Tim waltz to hit him back [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1784.2s)]
*  But then he made that answer I thought was very good because he finally kind of came back to like it's not about how Finland [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1788.32s)]
*  Has as many guns as we have or the fuck we were talking about sometimes. It's just about the guns [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1793.04s)]
*  Well, I mean JD Vance caveated his answer for how to prevent children from getting shot by saying this answer sucks [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1796.92s)]
*  We need to lock the doors to know stronger doors stronger doors stronger windows like that [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1804.56s)]
*  I first grade classrooms. That is not a credible or serious answer and I thought walls was emotional. He told the story about his son [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1810.24s)]
*  And then he credentialed himself as a gun owner who like supports the Second Amendment [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1816.96s)]
*  But you know, he's not willing to do nothing in the face of children getting shot over and over and over again [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1820.24s)]
*  I thought it was compelling and real and came from like a sincere place and JD Vance just sound like a smarmy prick [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1826.72s)]
*  It's wild that both members of the Democratic ticket are gun owners and the Republican nominee can't buy a gun in some states [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1831.88s)]
*  That's a fair point [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1840.92s)]
*  alright, so [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1842.96s)]
*  Toward the end of the debate [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1844.4s)]
*  moderators asked about health care and [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1845.92s)]
*  Donald Trump's now infamous comment that the Harris walls campaign turned into an a big ad that they're running all over the country [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1848.74s)]
*  Was out today. It's about health care. It's about Trump saying he has concepts of a plan [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1855.86s)]
*  For what to replace the ACA with after he kills it [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1860.9s)]
*  Let's listen and I think you can make a really good argument that it salvaged Obamacare [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1864.5s)]
*  Which was doing disastrously until Donald Trump came along he ran on the first thing [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1868.62s)]
*  He was gonna do on day one was to [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1873.94s)]
*  Repeal Obamacare on day one. He tried to sign an executive order to repeal the ACA [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1876.46s)]
*  He signed on to a lawsuit to repeal the ACA but lost at the Supreme Court [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1882.3000000000002s)]
*  And he would have repealed the ACA had it not been for the courage of John McCain to save that bill [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1887.6200000000001s)]
*  Something that these guys do is they make a lot of claims about if Donald Trump becomes president all of these terrible [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1895.3400000000001s)]
*  Consequences are gonna ensue but in reality Donald Trump was president inflation was low [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1902.22s)]
*  Take-home pay was higher and he saved the very program from a Democratic administration [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1907.14s)]
*  That was collapsing and would have collapsed absent his leadership [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1912.42s)]
*  I mean one of the most one of those galling answers I've ever heard in a debate. I'm really stunning [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1916.7800000000002s)]
*  It was Paul Ryan who was trying to [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1926.5800000000002s)]
*  Trump saved it from Paul Ryan [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1929.58s)]
*  Well that whole answer to like I do think the part where he says like oh, I do worry about that that framing right? [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1931.58s)]
*  Like they say Trump is so dangerous, but things were actually better [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1937.54s)]
*  Then you like on Obamacare itself JD Vance does a sort of intellectual nonsense around it [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1940.1799999999998s)]
*  Well, actually concepts of plan is actually how you make laws you have an idea and and but but like you can go look [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1945.4599999999998s)]
*  I've been running for president and president for the last nine years still has no plan [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1951.1399999999999s)]
*  Just waiting Donald Trump was so horny for repealing the Obamacare Obamacare that after the house passed the repeal [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1955.78s)]
*  He didn't wait for it to pass the Senate to do what looked like a signing ceremony in the Rose Garden [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1962.1s)]
*  He took a picture with all the Republican House members behind him to celebrate repealing Obamacare [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1967.3799999999999s)]
*  They did not have a plan to replace it [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1972.5s)]
*  The reason John McCain did a thumbs down on repealing Obamacare was not because he was in favor of Obamacare is because there was [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1973.86s)]
*  No plan to replace it. That was the reason you say Donald Trump's president all these bad things are gonna happen [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1979.22s)]
*  He was president and people didn't 20 million people didn't lose their health care because John McCain stopped him [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1984.5s)]
*  Yeah, because they didn't do the bad thing [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1989.66s)]
*  Yeah [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1991.18s)]
*  and by the way like because Democrats and everyone else and the whole country hated it it was the least popular Donald Trump had [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1991.34s)]
*  Ever been in his whole presidency and he tried and tried to try it and he failed because he's bad at governing [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=1996.66s)]
*  That answer was an example as to why JD Vance is a good debater and a shitty politician [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2005.1s)]
*  Yeah, cuz it like you see the intellectual exercise in his head [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2009.38s)]
*  I'm not just gonna say it didn't get repeated [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2012.22s)]
*  I'm gonna say he saved it because I'm gonna take this arcane [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2014.5800000000002s)]
*  I don't know because Trump says that and he knows he has to mirror Trump's line [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2017.22s)]
*  I'm on this and it's obviously not believable and I agree with love it that the [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2020.8400000000001s)]
*  argument that [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2025.74s)]
*  Democrats say these bad things gonna happen when Trump was our president is [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2027.54s)]
*  One of their better even if it's a very fallacious argument [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2030.6200000000001s)]
*  On a lot of issues like when we call him a dictator and he was present for four years democracy didn't end all of that [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2034.5800000000002s)]
*  But the one issue where it is the worst argument is this one [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2040.16s)]
*  Yes [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2043.46s)]
*  He tried in to in every way possible to repeal the ACA in the most visible way possible throughout the entire presidency [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2043.8400000000001s)]
*  and by the way succeeded in in [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2050.96s)]
*  Getting rid of a really important part of health care, which is reproductive health care for millions upon millions of women also [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2052.8s)]
*  You know they can go interview a bunch of Republicans in Congress and they can all say look Donald Trump once again [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2058.2200000000003s)]
*  We don't have the appetite to go through ACA repeal again [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2062.7400000000002s)]
*  Even if they don't do that even they don't have the votes for to appeal the Affordable Care Act [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2066.6600000000003s)]
*  Which of course we know they're gonna try to do but even if they don't [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2071.1200000000003s)]
*  Joe Biden and Kamala Harris passed in the Inflation Reduction Act [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2074.6600000000003s)]
*  subsidies for the ACA that meant that mean that [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2078.34s)]
*  Millions of people around this country are paying lower premiums than they were before because of those subsidies [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2082.2200000000003s)]
*  They are going to expire at the end of 2025 and Donald Trump and Republicans have already said they do not want to extend them [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2086.6000000000004s)]
*  And so even if nothing happens [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2092.9s)]
*  Three and a half million people will lose their health insurance [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2094.9s)]
*  Just if Donald Trump doesn't do anything just if he wins and and you know [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2097.98s)]
*  So like the idea that oh Donald Trump's good nothing's gonna happen like no [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2101.82s)]
*  Everyone's good people are gonna pay more for health care if Donald Trump wins guaranteed [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2104.6600000000003s)]
*  Anyway, I think I do think that's one that the Harris campaign [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2109.34s)]
*  I thought that was gonna be the moment that they were gonna push tomorrow were it not for the the January 6th answer that came [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2113.28s)]
*  Afterwards but I you know, they've been doing the concepts of a plan ad today [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2118.54s)]
*  I kind of think that health there'll be a health care push in the next week or there should be [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2122.58s)]
*  You know [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2125.98s)]
*  Alright final thoughts on this debate [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2127.38s)]
*  What are the campaigns do with this debate anything the the Harris campaign talks about January 6th moment the Vance campaign [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2129.66s)]
*  I don't know what the Vance campaign [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2136.1s)]
*  Yeah, the Vance campaign I feel like yeah, I think it's I think it's pushing out that that democracy clip [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2138.74s)]
*  I do think that that it's worth going through like [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2143.66s)]
*  There was a few times are the debate where where JD Vance basically kind of invents a version of Donald Trump that doesn't doesn't exist [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2146.7599999999998s)]
*  it's obviously not as important as the common democracy we're all talking about but [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2153.56s)]
*  There was this moment where? [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2157.04s)]
*  Vance basically says Oh Trump had trees [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2159.3199999999997s)]
*  peacefully transferred power and [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2162.2799999999997s)]
*  All Donald Trump has ever said is he wanted the rules to be enforced fairly it reminded me of like the biggest creeps on the fucking [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2164.08s)]
*  Internet during Gamergate like attacking attacking women online and being like this is about ethics and video game journalism like being like oh [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2171.06s)]
*  Yeah, that's what it was about. It was about the fair administration of [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2178.14s)]
*  Of the electorals and there was that moment [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2181.18s)]
*  There's a moment on health care where I do think you can go and just take Donald Trump's absolute worst comments and take JD Vance's lies [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2183.18s)]
*  About them and put them side by side, and I think it'd be pretty powerful. Yeah, do you think we think we get another debate? [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2188.74s)]
*  Donald Trump came out tonight and said do not again no more debates [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2195.22s)]
*  Even though they know why you guys think that there might be another debate [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2198.18s)]
*  I mean, I think if I don't I don't think Trump wants to do it really or else you do it his staff [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2200.54s)]
*  Obviously doesn't want to do it because he was so terrible the last time yeah, well the Harris campaign wants it [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2205.7s)]
*  They were desperate for it. The media is desperate for it. Everyone wants it except for the Trump [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2209.8599999999997s)]
*  I mean we saw CNN who would host this debate [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2213.8199999999997s)]
*  Caitlin Collins just hammering Donald Trump jr. Robert [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2216.62s)]
*  Trump jr. Was such a fucking whiny little baby that he said even Fox couldn't fairly moderate the debate because they would try to appease the left [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2219.8599999999997s)]
*  As they always are [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2226.66s)]
*  the I do like the [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2228.98s)]
*  The JD Vance basically kind of inventing a nicer version of Trump Donald Trump pulling down the 60 minutes interview like I think all [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2231.74s)]
*  That is the same reason they won't want to put him in front of another debate [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2238.2599999999998s)]
*  Which is the Donald Trump that doesn't exist and isn't real it's like the best version they can have out there [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2241.14s)]
*  But I do wonder if like 48 hours of coverage of how great JD Vance did and how and how JD Vance [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2245.2s)]
*  Outshine Trump and how he didn't really defend Trump and it was really more about Vance like I got I'm curious how that how that how that [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2251.52s)]
*  affects [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2258.2400000000002s)]
*  The narcissist yeah, it's always hard to get inside Donald Trump's lizard brain and like he I was thinking that you know [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2259.44s)]
*  Maybe he's like I don't want JD Vance to have the last word here, but it's also they don't have that much time and [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2265.6s)]
*  It's clear that the Trump campaign thinks they are sitting on a lead that they are that they are doing well [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2271.64s)]
*  They're doing well in the polls the JD like I think they're buying their their spin on this which is [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2277.8s)]
*  Why they probably don't want to do another debate? I think that's probably right now whether they're right or not who knows but like I think [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2282.1200000000003s)]
*  That's probably what they think one thing [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2287.0800000000004s)]
*  I do hope that comes out of this debate is according to the CNN snap poll [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2288.52s)]
*  Tim Walls his favorability went from plus 14 before the debate to plus 37 after the debate [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2292.6800000000003s)]
*  I think that speaks well to his character his presentation the tone of the debate [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2298.48s)]
*  The fact that he delivered talked about things that people cared about in a way that connected that most voters [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2303.28s)]
*  Don't know what TNM and square is the voters don't give a shit what happened in 1989 [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2307.8s)]
*  And so I think it just speaks to the fact that he's an asset and we should get him out there [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2311.78s)]
*  And he should be doing a lot more interviews and be on the trail and doing things. I understand that they were probably [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2316.32s)]
*  Getting through debate prep because that was far more important and it also prepares you for future interviews [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2322.0800000000004s)]
*  But now I'd love to see just Harris and walls hit the gas [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2326.86s)]
*  You know be a little less risk averse do some more stuff and just you know [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2330.48s)]
*  We had [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2334.34s)]
*  One of the best interviews I've ever seen all the smoke podcast if folks don't know is to former NBA players usually they focus on [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2338.26s)]
*  Basketball, but it was an amazing interview, but they were members. They were members of the we believe warriors. She was she was funny [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2345.1000000000004s)]
*  She was thoughtful. She was like very comfortable. It was it was just a fantastic interview [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2351.76s)]
*  I agree and especially if there's not gonna be another debate, which I I don't think there will be [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2356.3s)]
*  They're gonna need to find ways to break through and and not break through like all the coverage because not everyone watches everything at the same time anymore [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2360.1s)]
*  But like just just taking more just having more opportunities to get out there [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2367.1s)]
*  Especially on stuff like the all the smoke pod where they're not those the people who watch that show or listen to that show are probably not [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2371.74s)]
*  Consuming a ton of political news. It's a sports show [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2378.54s)]
*  Get in front of those people who are not gonna hear about you in other places Tim Walls was on the we rate dogs YouTube channel [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2381.54s)]
*  Tim Walls was on the we rate dogs YouTube channel the other day. That's quite [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2386.74s)]
*  Sounds ridiculous, but it's actually smart. They get hosted their debate [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3YQoSSYhM&t=2390.98s)]
