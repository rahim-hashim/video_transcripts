Video Description: Elon Musk holds a rambling Oval Office press conference and admits that he and DOGE will make mistakes as they rampage through our government, even as congressional Republicans move forward with a budget that promises massive cuts to healthcare, education, and food assistance to pay for Trump's tax cuts for billionaires. Jon and Dan discuss whether Musk's antics could undermine Trump's agenda, what the Senate's confirmation of RFK Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard means for the GOP, and the White House's attacks on the press. Then, they debut a new segment: "Wait, Did That Really Happen?," featuring this week's most absurd scenes. Later, Lovett sits down with Rohit Chopra, recently forced out as Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to discuss why Trump and Musk are so determined to shut down the CFPB, and what it means for the rest of us.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Trump and Elon Musk Talk DOGE In Bizarre Oval Office Press Conference
**Pod Save America:** [February 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw)
*  I don't know if I've never heard the word invidious before. Have you? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, it's kind of an awkward thing to say. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3.44s)]
*  Oh, was it a wordle word that you used? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=5.28s)]
*  No, no, no. Too many letters for wordle. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=7.92s)]
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Jon Favreau. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=11.6s)]
*  I'm Dan Pfeiffer. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=13.76s)]
*  On today's show, the free speech warriors in the White House are kicking out media outlets [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=14.8s)]
*  that still call the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf of Mexico. Elon Musk holds an Oval Office press [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=19.36s)]
*  conference where he admits that he and the dogebags haven't quite gotten everything right. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=24.96s)]
*  While breaking our government and our laws. And while they brag about finding a few billion in [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=30.0s)]
*  cuts, we'll take a look at the trillions that Republicans in Congress want to cut from the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=35.68s)]
*  budget in order to help pay for their $4.5 trillion tax cut for people like Elon and Trump. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=39.68s)]
*  Then, Lovett sits down here in studio with Rohit Chopra, who Trump forced out as director of the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=47.2s)]
*  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last week so that banks and credit card companies [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=52.8s)]
*  can go back to screwing us. Great times. Great times. But first, big congrats to Bashar Al-Assad [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=57.52s)]
*  and the measles for getting Tulsi Gabbard and RFK Jr. confirmed as cabinet secretary. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=67.84s)]
*  Big congrats to measles. In the end, every Republican senator but resistance hero Mitch [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=74.08s)]
*  McConnell voted yes on Gabbard and Kennedy. So rest assured that our health and national security [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=81.68s)]
*  are in good hands, Dan. Things also look good for Cash Patel, even though he was reportedly [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=89.28s)]
*  purging the FBI before even being confirmed. But the big news this week, at least according to a [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  very excited President Trump, was his announcement of reciprocal tariffs. He said, this was the big [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=101.92000000000002s)]
*  one. This was the big one. He said, I had three great weeks, but this is the biggest one yet. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=108.32s)]
*  He was asked about those tariffs after announcing them in the Oval Office. And here's part of the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=112.96s)]
*  presser. And prices could go up somewhat short term, but prices will also go down. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=119.83999999999999s)]
*  Would you also direct agencies to study the impact they would have on prices in the US? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=124.88s)]
*  No, there's nothing to study. There's nothing to study. It's going to go well. The United States [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=130.32s)]
*  is going to become a very, very strong economic, economically country. Yeah. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=135.28s)]
*  Prices could go up. Prices could go down. There's nothing to study. Don't worry about it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=139.52s)]
*  So an announcement that lots of shit we buy is about to be more expensive. Just a few days [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=144.88s)]
*  after we learned that inflation is rising again, the biggest one month jump since August of 2023. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=151.44s)]
*  What do you think, Dan? Promises made, promises kept? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=160.48s)]
*  Yeah, it seems great. It seems like things are going exactly as planned. I mean, it is noted that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=163.36s)]
*  Trump went to the, at the convention, declared that the inflation crisis would end immediately. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=166.8s)]
*  Inflation has gone up. He is doing things to raise prices. And that's even before we get into the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  potential impacts of his mass deportation plan, what a giant tax cut that overwhelmingly benefits [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=176.88000000000002s)]
*  corporations and the wealthy would do. And I think it is just worth, we're like living this in truly [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  insane time. We're going to talk about a lot of the really insane, dangerous and dumb things that [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=188.72000000000003s)]
*  are happening over the course of this podcast. But it's also possible that politics really hasn't [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=192.56s)]
*  changed that much. And Donald Trump simply won the presidency because people were really mad at the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=197.6s)]
*  incumbent administration because prices were too high. And now Donald Trump is the incumbent [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=202.48s)]
*  administration and people are still mad the prices are too high. And instead of trying to address that [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=205.84s)]
*  as he promised he would do, he is doing things would actually exacerbate the crisis. And so [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=210.08s)]
*  we will find out soon enough whether political gravity is a thing that still exists. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=215.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you mentioned that people still think that prices are too high. On Tuesday's [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=219.28s)]
*  show, we talked about the CBS poll that showed 66% of voters think that Trump is not doing enough to [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=223.68s)]
*  focus on prices. Echelon Insights, which is a Republican run polling firm, they just came out [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=229.36s)]
*  with their latest poll right before we started recording. 43% of voters said cost of living is [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=236.64s)]
*  either the biggest or second biggest issue facing the country. And the next closest issue was [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=243.84s)]
*  immigration at 29%. And then political corruption at 23%. Seems like there's plenty of that these [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=251.04s)]
*  days. But number one, 43% are still concerned about the cost of living. So no, it wasn't vibes. No, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=256.96s)]
*  it wasn't just in people's heads. It was a real concern about prices throughout the Biden [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=265.44s)]
*  administration, a real concern about costs, and people are still concerned that Donald Trump is [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=270.88s)]
*  not focusing on costs. And now these reciprocal tariffs, which is basically any country that has [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=275.84s)]
*  levied a tariff on our goods, now we're levying tariffs on any goods that are imported from them. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=281.84s)]
*  But again, tariffs are charged to the US companies that are importing the goods and then the companies [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=287.52s)]
*  pass on the price increases to us. So we will be paying more. It's like someone said it's like, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=294.64s)]
*  we're shooting ourselves in the foot for other countries shooting themselves in the foot. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=302.56s)]
*  That's what a reciprocal tariff is. I'll say just the other thing about this that is [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=305.76s)]
*  notable is because inflation went back up again, the Fed is now less likely to and highly unlikely [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=310.56s)]
*  to cut interest rates again, which we often treat interest rates and inflation as two separate but [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=318.08s)]
*  related things when they're actually for the voter, the same thing. If interest rates stay up, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  credit cards are more expensive, buying cars is more expensive, getting a home loan is more [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=330.32s)]
*  expensive, your costs are more expensive, you're locked into your homes. And so Trump, maybe he [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=334.24s)]
*  will just fire the Fed chair against the law, he will bully him into lowering interest rates. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=339.36s)]
*  But in a role in which he is not demonstrating to the Fed that he is trying to bring down [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=344.08s)]
*  inflation, he is going to make his own situation worse because they are going to feel like Trump [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=348.64s)]
*  is an untrustworthy partner in this or an unreliable partner and are therefore going to [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=353.59999999999997s)]
*  keep interest rates high for a much longer period of time. And again, we're going to talk about [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=358.24s)]
*  the Congress trying to move Trump's legislative agenda, which is just a giant tax cut. And that [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=363.76s)]
*  tax cut is not primarily for most people in this country who are concerned about inflation. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=370.24s)]
*  Most of the tax cuts are going to billionaires, big corporations, the wealthiest people. And [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=376.96000000000004s)]
*  he's got his no tax on tips thing if that gets through, that I guess is if you're in the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=384.08s)]
*  restaurant industry or if you work on tips anywhere, then that helps you. But there's nothing else [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=389.92s)]
*  in that agenda for middle class people. In fact, there's a lot of cuts coming to health [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=397.92s)]
*  care and education that are going to hurt middle class people. So something to watch, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=402.72s)]
*  certainly something to watch. Any comment on the confirmations on Gabbard and Kennedy going [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=407.52000000000004s)]
*  through? I know you wrote a message box Thursday morning about what we can learn from the Gabbard [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=412.96000000000004s)]
*  vote. Yeah, I mean, it is deeply alarming that we have an anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist at the [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=417.84000000000003s)]
*  head of our health care system and someone who has played footsie with Bashar al-Assad and Putin [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=425.28s)]
*  and has also embraced all kinds of conspiracy theories in charge of our intelligence agencies. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=433.76s)]
*  If you had told people six months ago that that's how this was going to end, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=440.4s)]
*  people would have laughed at you. People would have treated it as liberal MSNBC, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=444.4s)]
*  Positive America, hysteria to suggest such crazy things. And look, I think as it relates to the [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=449.35999999999996s)]
*  Republican Party, and this is particularly true of the Gabbard confirmation, but also true of the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=454.16s)]
*  RFK Jr. one as well, is that the fact that every Republican except Mitch McConnell voted for these [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=460.16s)]
*  folks is proof that the Republican Party as an independent entity is dead. It is now just a [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=466.40000000000003s)]
*  vehicle for Trump's whims and desires. They have no independent policy positions. They just confirmed [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=472.88s)]
*  someone who spent most of their life being pro-choice to be in charge of the health care system. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=477.68s)]
*  They just confirmed someone who is the closest person to Russia in the United States Congress [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=483.6s)]
*  when they were there to be the head of the intelligence agencies. And this is different [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=490.40000000000003s)]
*  than when it was before. If you remember in 2017, the Republican House and Senate passed a bill [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=496.56s)]
*  to keep Trump from taking sanctions off of Russia. During the Biden administration, when a bunch of [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=502.0s)]
*  Trump's allies at the behest of Trump wanted to get rid of funding for Ukraine, it was the Republican [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=509.44s)]
*  Senate who stopped them. And now it's just like, we will do whatever they want. And even on foreign [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=514.8s)]
*  policy, the one place they had held the line over the years, and it's just like, this is the end of [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=519.36s)]
*  the party as an actual entity that will survive Trump. And they gave it all up for nothing more [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=524.48s)]
*  than avoiding a primary challenge in the next election. Because that's how you know that that's [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=530.64s)]
*  what this is about, because Mitch McConnell is almost certainly retiring now. And so he's the [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=533.92s)]
*  only one who feels like he can vote his conscience without suffering the repercussions because he's [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=539.2s)]
*  immune from them. I don't really get what Murkowski and Collins were doing on these, though, either. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=544.6400000000001s)]
*  Their statements are basically like, well, I got assurances from them. And they've put my, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=549.6800000000001s)]
*  you know, that both nominees sort of like put our concerns to rest. So I guess we'll just trust them. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=553.6800000000001s)]
*  And I guess that means that Collins is maybe Collins is worried about a primary challenge. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=558.5600000000001s)]
*  So I guess that means she's probably she's thinking about running again and not retiring, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=563.36s)]
*  though she could very well retire. She's old enough. And then and Murkowski too, like I just [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=567.12s)]
*  I the credulousness. I just can't none of them believe it. Not a single one of them. Like, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=572.8s)]
*  maybe like Tommy Tuberville believes this bullshit. But if you gave truth serum to the [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=578.88s)]
*  Republican Senate caucus, overwhelmingly, they would say was fucking insane to confirm Tulsi [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=584.08s)]
*  Gabbard for this job, that it was ridiculously irresponsible to confirm RFK tuna for this job. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=590.24s)]
*  They all believe that but they won't do it. And what I think this is really interesting about [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=596.4s)]
*  Trump's brand of politics is normally if you don't need the votes, and they weren't going to need [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=599.4399999999999s)]
*  every single Republican this time, you let people take a walk on a tough vote, particularly someone [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=605.76s)]
*  like Susan Collins, who was in a blue state, like give her a chance. They don't need her vote to [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=610.4s)]
*  pass to confirm either these people, let her vote the other way so she can show her, you know, her [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=614.8s)]
*  brand of independence or whatever else. But Trump does not do that. He makes you everything's a [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=619.68s)]
*  loyalty test, right? You have to walk across the hot coals for him, even at your own peril. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=624.64s)]
*  And you do it because he is so vengeful. He's so petty that you don't even know what he could do. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=630.16s)]
*  He and his allies could unleash upon you if you vote. And like that says just how sort of perverted [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=636.4s)]
*  the political incentive structure has become under Trump. Yeah, no, it's I mean, this what happens in [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=641.92s)]
*  authoritarian governments, like it's just exactly that, right? Like he's got the whole the party [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=647.68s)]
*  belongs to him. And they are scared of him scared of both like their professional careers. And in [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=652.72s)]
*  some cases, people are literally scared of death threats. So I mean, it's wild. It was another big [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=659.36s)]
*  week for Chancellor Elon Musk, who held his first Oval Office press conference while two fidgety [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=666.24s)]
*  toddlers looked on impatiently, Elon's four year old son and his 78 year old boss, Donald Trump, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=670.96s)]
*  Elon droned on about Doge and a weird rambling monologue that did include one newsworthy [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=677.36s)]
*  admission. Some of the things that I say will be incorrect and should be corrected. So nobody can [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=685.84s)]
*  have had a thousand. Oh, well, nevertheless, you know. And sure enough, sure enough, many things [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=691.76s)]
*  he has said over the last several weeks and months have been incorrect. Here's a real doozy from this [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=698.96s)]
*  week. The Justice Department had to admit in a court filing that one of Musk's Doge bags didn't [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=703.76s)]
*  just have read only access to Treasury's payment system, but was accidentally given full access [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=710.56s)]
*  accidentally. So all this time that that Elon and Doge were like, no, no, they only had read only [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=718.72s)]
*  access, no big deal. And then the Justice Department, of course, believes that and then they file in [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=725.12s)]
*  court and then suddenly the Justice Department talks to Treasury, talks to Elon. Oh shit. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=729.9200000000001s)]
*  Whoops, our bad. So that happened. Doge is also at least so far having a rough go at it in court. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=734.72s)]
*  They've been kicked out of the Treasury payment system. The federal funding freeze has been [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=743.76s)]
*  temporarily blocked and the gutting of USAID and the National Institutes of Health have been [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=747.44s)]
*  temporarily blocked as well. What would you make of Elon's weird oval presser and all the latest [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=754.0s)]
*  Doge news? I have so many questions about the press conference. So many questions. How did it [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=761.52s)]
*  happen? Why is he like, why was he there? Why was his child there? Why was he dressed like that? Why [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=767.52s)]
*  was he wearing a hat? Make America great hat, but it's in black. The dark, the dark hat, which you [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=773.44s)]
*  know, because he replied to your tweet this morning. He did reply to my tweet. Yeah, no, he's [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=778.16s)]
*  about the story that the State Department looked like they wanted to buy like a couple hundred [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=782.64s)]
*  million dollars worth of Tesla, armed Tesla trucks. But apparently it was a request made in the Biden [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=789.12s)]
*  administration and it was to armor maybe electric vehicles that they already had. But then someone [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=796.88s)]
*  in the State Department, once it was reported, changed it and erased Tesla. So they were getting [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=803.1999999999999s)]
*  in trouble and just made it like the whole thing. But Elon wanted to tell me that it was fake news. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=808.72s)]
*  So there you go. Well, congratulations on reaching this boss level of clout you now have. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=814.4s)]
*  I can't wait for Cash Patel to come crashing through the doors now. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=823.28s)]
*  Don't necessarily want to be on that radar screen. But the key, if you're a mole, the key to not [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=826.72s)]
*  getting whacked is keeping your head in the hole. So there you go. So much for that. Look, I think [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=831.12s)]
*  the whole thing was ridiculous. It was strange. It was interminably long and incredibly awkward. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=835.84s)]
*  Yes. I mean, it's just, it is in many ways just sort of like a metaphor for what the Trump [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=841.2800000000001s)]
*  presidency has been. Trump is just sitting there quietly while Elon Musk holds court and sort of [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=848.48s)]
*  runs the government. Though I will say though that he was sitting quietly, like surprisingly quietly [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=853.44s)]
*  for Trump. But you know, we've all watched Trump enough now for the last however many years, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=858.72s)]
*  decade. He looked like alternately sort of annoyed and kind of like, come on, hurry it up. He had to [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=863.76s)]
*  like interject once in a while. He's like, and tell them what you found. Tell them what your team [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=870.8s)]
*  found. Like he was, you could tell, I don't know if Trump's going to let that happen again. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=875.76s)]
*  No, he was, he was also trapped because he was sitting down. So he really was in like this [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=879.68s)]
*  terrible position where he could not get up from where he was without, I guess, I mean, just it was [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=884.88s)]
*  very, it was like a strange thing. I like for people like you and I, we watched the whole thing. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=889.28s)]
*  It seems like it should be a disaster for everyone involved. Elon seems strange and weird and [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=894.0799999999999s)]
*  incorrect. And Trump look, you know, Trump is being basically told to shush his mouth by a small child. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=898.72s)]
*  All kinds of weird things are happening. And it's like, ah, what a clown show. But I do, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=905.8399999999999s)]
*  it's worth like just stepping back and recognizing that this does fit within Trump's strategy, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=911.68s)]
*  the first few weeks, which is just grab all the attention all the time. And this dominated [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=919.12s)]
*  attention. The cable news covered it the whole time, just went live for this whole thing. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=925.28s)]
*  The, it led the network news that night. Now, I, no one should really give a lot of shits about [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=930.88s)]
*  what leads on network news these days or goes live on cable, but because more, but more importantly, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=937.36s)]
*  it became like a moment online. It was a thing that broke through. It became this topic of [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=942.24s)]
*  conversation. It was immediately memeified. And there were all these memes going around about [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=946.88s)]
*  what we know with Elon, with his kid around on his shoulders as he answering the questions. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=951.04s)]
*  And I'm not sure to the extent of the public consumed any of it. And they're probably at most [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=955.76s)]
*  just like glancing by it or seeing moments on TikTok or Instagram or whatever else. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=960.08s)]
*  It is just sort of like this political outsider who's such an outsider. He's dressed like a [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=964.64s)]
*  weirdo in the Oval Office with his kid on his shoulders, defending his efforts to cut government [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=969.04s)]
*  and get rid of waste. And that's not in itself totally bad. It's just, I just think as we look [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=973.92s)]
*  at all these things, it's just another reminder that in this day and age, the quantity of attention [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=980.0s)]
*  is more important than the quality. And this was a massive quantity of attention. So, you know, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=984.16s)]
*  you raise a debate that's been going around in democratic circles and it's like how much, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=990.4s)]
*  you know, what do people really think of Elon and how do we talk about Doge and cutting government [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=995.04s)]
*  knowing that people do want to, you know, get rid of government waste, but maybe what Elon's doing [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1001.28s)]
*  isn't so popular and he's not so popular. So I got some more data from Echelon on this right [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1006.8s)]
*  before we recorded Trump's approval is at 5246. Right. So he is still above water. Elon's approval [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1013.12s)]
*  is 4350. So he is underwater. They asked what you think about Elon's role in government right now. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1022.64s)]
*  Only 40% approved, 51% disapproved. So that's underwater. Then they asked two questions. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1031.92s)]
*  One, Elon is right to try and fix broken DC bureaucracies that waste hundreds of billions [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1038.8s)]
*  of dollars and spend taxpayer money on radical ideologies that most Americans don't agree with. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1043.92s)]
*  Agree or disagree. And it was 50 agree, 42 disagree. Then they asked, Elon is, then they did a [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1049.04s)]
*  statement, Elon is wrong to dismantle vital aid programs and other agencies when he wasn't elected [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1055.52s)]
*  and has no expertise in government. And people agree with that statement 5743. And then they [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1060.4s)]
*  asked, which of those statements do you agree more with? And 50 by 50 to 44 people agreed with [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1067.2s)]
*  Elon is wrong to be doing this and not right. So it's a it's, you know, one indicator, one poll, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1073.8400000000001s)]
*  but it's an early indicator that like, a it tells you, I think, how to talk about this. But B, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1079.8400000000001s)]
*  that, you know, while people don't like bloated government and do like cutting waste, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1086.48s)]
*  they are not super excited about the way that Elon has gone about it. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1091.3600000000001s)]
*  The way I think to read that poll is that Elon is actually a drag on what would be an otherwise [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1095.3600000000001s)]
*  more popular effort. Yes, I totally agree. Because if you could only get to 50 on the idea of getting [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1100.64s)]
*  rid of bloat and waste in government, because Elon's name's attached, it's because if you send the [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1105.0400000000002s)]
*  world's richest man into government to who has, you know, billions of dollars in government contracts [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1109.2800000000002s)]
*  to manage federal spending, that seems pretty sketchy to just about any person. And so like, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1115.2s)]
*  it's just there, like there is a secondary debate about how much we focus on Elon, how much we focus [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1122.24s)]
*  on Trump. I think there's real advantage in focusing on Elon. And I think I've been sort of [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1126.64s)]
*  playing with like a little not a message per se, right, not a slogan, but like a framework to think [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1130.16s)]
*  about how to describe what's happening in the Trump administration, particularly as it relates [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1139.92s)]
*  to Doge. Because there is, how you talk about this does matter somewhat, but is to focus, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1143.44s)]
*  is to center the, like the two themes of the Trump presidency to date are chaos and corruption. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1149.28s)]
*  And I think if you, the way to get into the Doge stuff is, yes, talk about all the vital programs [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1155.3600000000001s)]
*  that are being, and be specific about what they are, but it's also just pure fucking chaos, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1160.56s)]
*  right? There's a story, I think it was in the Times about this school that's been, has this [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1164.72s)]
*  federal grant to get a, to get new school buses. They've, they're like, they've made four of the [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1169.44s)]
*  five payments, but they didn't withdraw the fifth payment before Trump was sworn in. And now they [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1172.8s)]
*  can't get the school bus. Yeah. And now they're going to have to, now they're going to have to pay [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1176.3200000000002s)]
*  out of their own budget for the school buses, even though they were promised the money and now they [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1179.76s)]
*  can't hire the new teachers they needed. It's just like a very close friend of mine, who works in [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1182.8s)]
*  education, just doing consulting for school districts, a bunch of her, you know, these are [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1188.0800000000002s)]
*  like long-term grants. So they've been working with these school districts on like teacher [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1194.3200000000002s)]
*  accreditation and teacher training for years, just all gone two days ago, just in the middle [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1197.76s)]
*  of the program, right? Just like they're working through, like you're halfway through. It's one [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1202.72s)]
*  thing to stop new money from going out the door, right? Or looking at not, I don't mean like the [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1206.96s)]
*  fifth of the seven payments, but to say, here are the new grant applications that have come in since [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1213.52s)]
*  Trump was president, or it is time to renew the grant. And then you can, you, the voters voted [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1219.76s)]
*  for you, you can put within all legal frameworks, your ideological framework on what kind of [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1224.8s)]
*  grant should get approved, but to stop things in the middle, right? I mean, you guys talked a lot [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1230.8s)]
*  about what's happening to the folks in USAID, who just, but just it's pure chaos. It's wrecking [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1235.12s)]
*  chaos in people's lives. And then you have the fact that you have on top of that, the world's [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1240.6399999999999s)]
*  richest man doing it while he is cutting agencies that are regulating his businesses [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1244.6399999999999s)]
*  is just like that. That is what everyone hates about politics, right? It is the cynicism that [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1253.92s)]
*  drove many of them to vote for Trump. And it can be the cynicism that caused, and the rightfully [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1258.64s)]
*  well-earned cynicism about government in this case, that causes them to go the other direction. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1262.48s)]
*  Well, and to your point about like Elon being a drag on Doge or on the effort, they did a, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1266.8s)]
*  they actually landed like a battery of approval, disapproval on various public figures and agencies. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1273.3600000000001s)]
*  The least popular in the whole list was Elon, by the way, which is great. And USAID, Doge was at [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1281.04s)]
*  39.33 approved, disapproved. So like slightly above water for Doge, but Elon was very much underwater. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1289.04s)]
*  And then even USAID was 39.28 approved. And so I know everyone says that everyone hates foreign aid [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1296.32s)]
*  and it's bad and stuff like that. But I do think that it's been in the new, my guess would be it [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1304.96s)]
*  has been in the news so much that people are sort of hearing stories about the humanitarian [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1310.16s)]
*  assistance that's gotten cut. And it's not as unpopular as foreign aid might usually be in a poll. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1317.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's reflexive partisanship, right? This is the same impulse that caused in 2017 Democrats to [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1322.16s)]
*  become huge fans of the New York Times has caused us to become huge fans of USAID. It's like Trump's [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1330.4s)]
*  against it. It must be good. Yeah, no, that makes sense. And I would say actually in the long run [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1335.1200000000001s)]
*  for the world, one half of America's two parties becoming full throated advocates for humanitarian [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1338.96s)]
*  assistance is more valuable than subsidizing word of acquisitions at the New York Times. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1346.64s)]
*  Wow. I just like that you really swerved to hit that. That's what I enjoyed. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1353.76s)]
*  That wasn't even planned that. That was just like came naturally. I don't know why. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1359.8400000000001s)]
*  Well, before we move on from Elon, did you see that weird ass photo of Elon? So Prime Minister [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1363.2s)]
*  Modi of India is in DC. I think he's like doing a presser with Trump probably as we record this. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1371.6000000000001s)]
*  He's got a meeting with bilateral Trump today. He also though met with Elon Musk. And there's a [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1378.16s)]
*  picture of Elon shaking his hand, sitting down shaking his hand like Elon's the fucking president. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1384.08s)]
*  And then it's also very funny because when you zoom out, it looks like a traditional by-lat with [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1389.92s)]
*  all of Modi's staffers and officials from India on one side. And then on the other side, it's just [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1394.4s)]
*  a couple of kids, Elon's kids. Several of Elon's kids, yes. There was this funny line in one of [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1401.1200000000001s)]
*  the stories. It was like Modi had this, obviously all of his staff. And it said, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1407.28s)]
*  Elon was only accompanied by this woman who's a longtime lieutenant and the mother of three [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1410.72s)]
*  of his children. So I was like, that's who came. It's also just, and Trump was asked about it [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1415.52s)]
*  in the Oval Press Conference that he did. And they're like, oh, do you know Elon [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1421.52s)]
*  met with Modi? And he's like, no, I'm not really aware. And he's like, well, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1426.16s)]
*  do you know why he met with him? He's like, well, I assume he wants to do business in India. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1430.8s)]
*  Look, do you know about what he had? He had no clue. He was like, yeah, I assume he wants to do [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1435.6s)]
*  business. I would really like some real reporting, especially from those weirdo people I just said. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1439.44s)]
*  Just unfairly attacked. But about how the meeting came to be. When you look at the picture, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1445.04s)]
*  that is the classic State Department setup for a bilateral meeting. If the Secretary of State [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1450.96s)]
*  is traveling abroad or even a lower government official is traveling abroad as an official [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1458.96s)]
*  representative of something, it's always that. It's the flags, the chairs, the handshake. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1465.36s)]
*  Was that set up? Who booked that? Who talked to Modi? Who in the White House signed off on it? [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1471.2800000000002s)]
*  This is small pennies, but I assume that's all State Department stuff that was put together for [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1478.88s)]
*  that meeting. How did that happen? The fact that Trump just acknowledged in that Q&A that Elon was [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1484.5600000000002s)]
*  doing this because he wants to do business in India, which he definitely does, and that Trump [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1492.48s)]
*  had no problem with Elon using his special government employee status to get meetings [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1496.0s)]
*  with foreign leaders in places where he wanted to do business. We just did the chaos part of [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1501.2s)]
*  the equation I wanted to get to. This is the corruption part. It's just unbelievable. It's [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1507.36s)]
*  like, yeah, he's Elon Musk, so he gets to meet with all the people that President Trump gets [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1512.48s)]
*  to meet with. Only for him, it's purely financial. That's great. It really is like White House [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1516.16s)]
*  fantasy camp. It's like these people who pay a ton of money to go to Duke basketball program, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1523.92s)]
*  grown adults, and put on the uniform, and they run out through Cameron, and they go to a practice [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1532.48s)]
*  with Coach K back in the day. This is the same thing. He spent a quarter of a billion dollars [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1536.16s)]
*  of his own money, and he gets to play pretend president with some actual real authorities [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1541.76s)]
*  for as long as he wants. He gets to break government, and he gets to make sure that [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1546.64s)]
*  his friends and his allies, I mean, it's Trump's thing too. His companies. Everyone's friends, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1549.92s)]

*  you know, invidious or not, is you have all of these businesses, these large corporate entities [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1880.16s)]
*  of which journalism is usually a money losing part of it, or a, or it's not at least not a part of [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1886.48s)]
*  their revenue future. And they are making decisions about the larger company that's affecting the [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1892.48s)]
*  journalism of the entity there. And that, you know, we have there is this whole thing about whether [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1898.96s)]
*  Paramount, which has a merger before the FCC is going to settle this ridiculous lawsuit [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1904.8000000000002s)]
*  for 60 minutes just as a way to ensure that they can get their merger greenlit by the FCC. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1912.0800000000002s)]
*  Like that is very, very real. I'm always torn. Like it is insane that the White House is so [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1918.88s)]
*  petty that they're not gonna let the AP in because they won't give Trump's fake name to something [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1924.0s)]
*  real. And sometimes the press overstates or overreacts to smaller things and claims it's [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1928.56s)]
*  an free speech. Like the way people treated a Barack Obama not doing enough press conferences [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1935.6799999999998s)]
*  was or not taking enough questions on the rope line as the end of the free press. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1939.76s)]
*  Or when Jim Acosta lost his White House badge briefly. But these things like doing, trying to [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1948.3999999999999s)]
*  bully the AP has an impact on what others will do. And I think it's it is quite concerning. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1952.96s)]
*  Well, I mean, just look at how many times Donald Trump since he's become president again, [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1959.04s)]
*  has gone and taken questions from the press, right, which is a lot of times. And in some of [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1963.8400000000001s)]
*  those instances, and we've talked about them on the show, people have asked a challenging question [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1968.88s)]
*  or a critical question of Trump. Like, if you get to the point where they kick out the AP, [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1973.28s)]
*  they kick out all the legacy media outlets, or all the outlets that they think might ask difficult [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1978.32s)]
*  questions, and all you get is just fawning questions from Newsmax and OAN and, and, you know, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1982.56s)]
*  the ruthless podcast and all the other fucking idiots that they let into the briefing room now. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1988.8s)]
*  If that's all the questions that we get, then it's going to just sound like North Korean television. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1993.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it's like this is this is like a longer conversation about the differences between press [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=1998.6399999999999s)]
*  access and press freedom. Yeah. Right. And, you know, and I think Caroline Leavitt, the Trump [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2003.12s)]
*  press secretary said the AP doesn't have a right to cover these events. Right. Because ultimately, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2008.48s)]
*  what the freedom of the press is about is the government cannot stop you from printing what [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2014.8s)]
*  you want to print. Right. But it is it like it democracy suffers when there is not press access. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2018.24s)]
*  Yes. Right. There is less transparency, there's less scrutiny. And you know, we've already saw [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2025.68s)]
*  this in the Pentagon where it's not that Pete Hickseth is keeping out mainstream press, but he [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2030.16s)]
*  has kicked the mainstream press out of their offices and allowed a bunch of ideological allies [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2036.08s)]
*  to come in and cover those places. And that's just it's all like this same thing, the point [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2039.6799999999998s)]
*  you made earlier is this is what happens in authoritarian regimes. Like it is slowly over time, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2044.3999999999999s)]
*  the very tired metaphor, the frog getting boiled, but the water is boiling and you can see it [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2050.48s)]
*  happening. Let's talk about Congress, which apparently is still a branch of government, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2055.7599999999998s)]
*  I guess. Republicans have begun their attempt to pass Trump's legislative agenda and the cuts [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2059.7599999999998s)]
*  they want make what Doge is doing seem like couch money. The House's budget proposal would [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2065.36s)]
*  cut at least one point five trillion dollars in health care, education, food assistance, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2071.6800000000003s)]
*  and other spending in order to help pay for a small portion of the four point five trillion [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2077.2000000000003s)]
*  dollars Republicans want to spend on tax cuts, which would mostly benefit the biggest companies [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2083.6800000000003s)]
*  and billionaires like Elon Musk, Donald Trump, and most of the cabinet. And since they're not [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2088.56s)]
*  paying for all those tax cuts, they also want to raise the debt limit by four trillion dollars. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2092.88s)]
*  This seems like it should be a huge political problem for Trump and the Republicans. But what [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2098.8s)]
*  do you think and how do you think Democrats should make sure that's the case? It is a huge political [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2105.12s)]
*  problem for Trump and the Republicans. This is the exact rhythm of Republican governance since Reagan [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2111.12s)]
*  run on reducing the deficit and government being too large, getting an office, and then having to [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2120.32s)]
*  actually make the cuts and having the public turn on you very quickly for doing so, getting booted [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2126.2400000000002s)]
*  out, getting Democrats in office, rinse, repeat. And for Trump, this is particularly dangerous [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2132.0s)]
*  because unlike all those other Republicans, he didn't run on any of this. That was one thing [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2137.28s)]
*  Elon kept saying in the weird press, white office presser was the public voted for this, public [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2140.8s)]
*  did not vote for this. This is not what Trump ran on. He did not run on cutting spending. He ran [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2147.6s)]
*  as Papua Canon and he's now governing like Paul Ryan. He has lost touch with what he's not a [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2154.6400000000003s)]
*  populist anymore. This is not a populist agenda. This is very improper stuff. And let's just take [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2163.28s)]
*  Medicaid for instance. Navigator Research had a poll out in late January. 81% of voters opposed [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2167.2000000000003s)]
*  cuts to Medicaid. 75% of Republicans opposed cuts to Medicaid. This is incredibly unpopular stuff. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2176.72s)]
*  And then you get to all the other spending cuts. You're looking at $800 billion in cuts to Medicaid. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2184.08s)]
*  That is cuts to healthcare, cuts to nursing home, it cuts to children's healthcare. That is a huge [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2189.04s)]
*  deal that will be felt by huge swaths of the population. And then after that, even if they [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2195.2799999999997s)]
*  did that, then they have to cut billions and billions and billions more from all the stuff [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2199.68s)]
*  that Elon is doing with small potatoes compared to this. You're going to have to slash food safety, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2204.4s)]
*  slash medical research, slash public education, slash emergency response to natural disasters, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2209.76s)]
*  all of those things. We've seen this happen every single time. And they want to eliminate [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2215.1200000000003s)]
*  the Department of Education, something Donald Trump just reiterated he wanted to do. And that [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2218.96s)]
*  is so unpopular. Huge majority is opposed it. And we've seen this before. After New [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2224.1600000000003s)]
*  Gingrich took power in 1994, the Republicans had the majority. They tried to eliminate [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2228.8s)]
*  the Department of Education. They got in a huge fight with Bill Clinton about it. Bill Clinton [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2232.2400000000002s)]
*  won that fight. The Republicans lost it so bad that when George W. Bush ran for president in 2000, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2234.96s)]
*  he ran on increasing education funding. This is such politically toxic stuff. And this is where [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2240.0800000000004s)]
*  Trump's honeymoon ends. Because right now he's out there, he's just saying the things he wants to do. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2247.6800000000003s)]
*  But now if he wants to actually do something, he has to get in the fucking muck with Congress [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2253.44s)]
*  to do this stuff. And it's incredibly unpopular. And as we know also painfully well, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2258.56s)]
*  once you start doing difficult legislative stuff with Congress, you'll lose the post-election [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2264.56s)]
*  sheen and you start looking pretty weak and pretty much like a typical politician. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2271.52s)]
*  I think I agree with all of that. I want all of that to be true. The things that worry me [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2276.48s)]
*  this time around that I think the advantages that Trump has that Republicans didn't have in [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2282.64s)]
*  the past is number one, the information environment now favors them in a huge way. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2290.3199999999997s)]
*  And so we can all be screaming about all these cuts that we're seeing and numbers and look at [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2296.08s)]
*  this in the budget and it's crazy, blah, blah, blah. And he's going to be out there being like, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2300.7999999999997s)]
*  well, what are you talking about? I've given everyone a tax cut. And I have this, he's got [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2305.04s)]
*  some small provision here and there. They might close the carried interest loophole or they saw [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2309.76s)]
*  something like they're going to take away tax breaks from billionaire sports team owners, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2314.4s)]
*  flashy stuff that gets attention, that breaks through. And they're going to say, we're not [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2321.2000000000003s)]
*  going to touch Medicare and Social Security, like he promised. And then on Medicaid, all we want to [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2327.6800000000003s)]
*  do is just add a work requirement. Don't we think that people who get health care from the government, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2332.88s)]
*  if they're able to work, should work? What's so crazy about that? And so they're going to- [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2338.24s)]
*  That can't get you the numbers he needs though. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2344.16s)]
*  No, I know. I know. But I do think that the fighting this is going to be difficult and also [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2346.0s)]
*  really important to make this about, I think people who are going to be hurt by these cuts [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2353.12s)]
*  and not just the numbers. And also, I wouldn't underestimate, it's obviously difficult once you [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2359.8399999999997s)]
*  get to Congress and you have to deal with Congress, that's true for every president, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2367.44s)]
*  and they have a very narrow majority of Republicans, but also they have proven themselves to [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2371.84s)]
*  do whatever he wants and not oppose him on almost anything so far. So I do wonder about some of the [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2377.6s)]
*  troublemakers in the Republican caucus, like in the freedom caucus, in the Republican house, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2387.04s)]
*  like the freedom caucus and some of those people. I wonder if they'll behave this time around just [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2391.36s)]
*  because they're guys in charge in the White House and they want to show unity and get something done. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2397.04s)]
*  I don't know. What do you think? Yeah. So I guess there's two separate questions. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2402.72s)]
*  I'll take the second one first, which is, can they pass this? Yeah, they absolutely can. It's [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2406.32s)]
*  not going to be easy. It'd be incredibly messy. And it may end up where the Senate has to go first. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2410.56s)]
*  And then the Republicans are put in this position to just eat it or have Trump's [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2416.32s)]
*  agenda fail. And I think that that's probably more likely. I mean, the House Republicans have [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2420.64s)]
*  not passed some sort of consequential budget measure without Democratic help in, other than [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2425.2s)]
*  sort of the fake debt ceiling thing, the Craig McCarthy, I think that might be the only one in [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2431.3599999999997s)]
*  like a decade. They always need Democrats because they cannot agree on this stuff. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2434.48s)]
*  But push comes to shove. It's very possible that they will put aside anything they possibly care [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2438.8799999999997s)]
*  about to help Trump. So we should assume that. So it's like, how do you win the fight? And you're [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2445.3599999999997s)]
*  100% right. This is not the media environment in which Democrats had previously succeeded in [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2449.68s)]
*  these fights at all. Because there's one thing the press loves. It's like stories about cuts. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2455.8399999999997s)]
*  What's going to go away? What are the specifics? Let's interview the people who are going to lose [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2464.7999999999997s)]
*  their program. And particularly in a world, especially when Bill Clinton did this, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2467.8399999999997s)]
*  where there were very robust regional press, it is death for Republicans. They're doing local [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2472.24s)]
*  standups outside the nursing home that's going to close without Medicaid funding. That kills them. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2477.6s)]
*  None of that exists anymore. And so we're going to have to be deft and strategic and loud in a [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2482.24s)]
*  way in which our party has been unable to do so at any point in recent history. So that is hard. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2487.8399999999997s)]
*  But we have the political high side and we have the better story to tell. So it is possible to do [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2493.7599999999998s)]
*  it. The most important thing here is to, there are two important things message-wise. One, [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2498.56s)]
*  be very specific about what is being cut. Even though Medicaid actually has a quite popular brand, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2504.7200000000003s)]
*  don't just say Medicaid. Talk about specifically what Medicaid funds. Children's health care, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2510.96s)]
*  nursing homes, prescription drugs, all of that. Be specific. When you get to the other cuts, [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2515.76s)]
*  be incredibly specific about what they are. There's a lot of language guidance we can get to [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2520.96s)]
*  when these cuts actually happen, how to talk about education cuts and things like that. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2524.4s)]
*  But to connect, why are they doing these cuts? To pay for tax cuts for huge corporations and [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2528.08s)]
*  rich people like Elon Musk and Donald Trump. That is why they are doing this. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2535.36s)]
*  And again, everything has got to be a story and we've got to attach people to it, whether it's [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2538.88s)]
*  the cuts or whether it's the tax cuts. And we should have which companies are going to be [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2544.4s)]
*  benefiting, how much they're going to get into the tax cut, how many billions they're going to [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2550.7200000000003s)]
*  get into the tax cut, which billionaires are going to benefit, and then which people are going [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2554.08s)]
*  to be hurt and how they're going to be hurt across all the different kinds of spending areas, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2558.72s)]
*  whether it's education, whether it's healthcare, whether it's food, whatever it may be. We just [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2564.24s)]
*  have to be very vivid and detailed in order to break through in this environment. Fewer numbers, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2568.24s)]
*  more stories, more people on everything that we do around this fight, I think. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2575.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2581.92s)]
*  Okay, before we get to Lovett's interview with Rohit Chopra, it's time for a new segment we're [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2583.12s)]
*  calling, wait, did that really happen? Just three quick hard to believe, holy shit, are you serious [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2588.48s)]
*  clips from this week that you may or may not have missed? First up, the Kennedy Center for the [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2595.44s)]
*  Performing Arts, the nation's cultural center right here, has a new board and a new chairman. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2601.76s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2610.64s)]
*  So we took over the Kennedy Center. We didn't like what they were showing. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2611.52s)]
*  It's a very exciting development. It's going to be great. I think we're going to do something [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2614.88s)]
*  very special. It got very wokey. I think we're going to make it hot. We made the presidency hot, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2619.52s)]
*  so this should be easy. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2626.08s)]
*  Going to make it hot. No more. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2627.7599999999998s)]
*  Just like the presidency. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2629.6s)]
*  It's getting too wokey. Why was the Kennedy Center too wokey? He was saying something like [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2630.72s)]
*  no more drag shows, but there were drag shows at the Kennedy Center? That would surprise me. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2635.84s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2640.24s)]
*  It's so funny that he fires the whole board and the chairman and he names himself chairman, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2641.44s)]
*  and then he puts a post up that's like, congratulations, Donald J. Trump is the [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2648.08s)]
*  new chairman. Like, oh wow, how did you get that? How did you finagle that one? [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2652.56s)]
*  Love it made this point on Twitter, but on the day we find out that inflation is going up, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2656.64s)]
*  Donald Trump appoints himself programming opera program director. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2660.64s)]
*  I like that he also, he originally put Rick Grinnell is the acting director. Rick Grinnell, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2664.32s)]
*  who some people thought was going to get secretary of state. Man, what a consolation prize. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2669.92s)]
*  Temporary acting director of the fucking Kennedy Center. Or maybe he's the permanent director. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2675.84s)]
*  Maybe Trump's the chairman. I don't know. I couldn't keep track. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2680.8s)]
*  Trump is the chairman of the board and Rick Grinnell as of the last time I looked at the [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2682.7200000000003s)]
*  internet was the interim director. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2686.32s)]
*  Oh, so he's still got it. Oh, congrats to Rick. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2688.0s)]
*  I mean, as like, I wouldn't say I'm tracking the story as closely as, I don't know, the Medicaid [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2690.32s)]
*  cuts or Elon Musk, but at one point he was the interim director. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2694.32s)]
*  I think Lee Greenwood's on the board. I think- [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2698.32s)]
*  Yes, obviously. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2700.96s)]
*  Usha Vance. I think they got a whole, they got a whole, Susie Wiles, White House chief of staff. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2702.0s)]
*  It's just going to be some great entertainment there. Great entertainment at the Kennedy Center. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2706.56s)]
*  The whole point of the Kennedy Center board was to raise money for the Kennedy Center. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2710.0s)]
*  The chair of the board was David Rubenstein, the incredibly wealthy [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2714.16s)]
*  private equity hedge fund guy who owns, so rich he owns a copy of the constitution, I think. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2717.68s)]
*  So when you get rid of him, like, is Donald Trump going to raise that money and give that money? [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2723.68s)]
*  No, I think Donald Trump just wants to, he just wants to be a host, right? This is like the whole [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2726.96s)]
*  thing of this president. He just wants to have a lot of shows at the Kennedy Center that are [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2731.3599999999997s)]
*  extremely tacky and he gets to go on stage and welcome everybody. Like, he's just, like, it's [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2734.96s)]
*  just, you know, it's an apprentice thing. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2739.92s)]
*  Well, I think he never went to Kennedy Center honors when he was president, I think. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2741.2799999999997s)]
*  Is that okay? [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2746.56s)]
*  Because I think he knew he would be made fun of by everyone because it's all the comedians. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2747.12s)]
*  And so this is just his way to, if he, if he can't be invited to the club, he's going to just [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2750.96s)]
*  buy the clubhouse. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2755.8399999999997s)]
*  Good luck, buddy. Good luck. Next up, the Kennedy Center's new chairman welcomes the [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2757.2799999999997s)]
*  anti-vax Kennedy in his cabinet with a brand new health conspiracy of his own. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2762.96s)]
*  Well, I feel sorry for Mitch. He's not equipped mentally. He wasn't equipped [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2768.08s)]
*  10 years ago, mentally, in my opinion. He'd let the Republican party go to hell. If I didn't come [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2772.48s)]
*  along, the Republican party wouldn't even exist right now. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2776.88s)]
*  I mean, he had polio, obviously, and I don't know. I don't know anything about he had polio. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2779.52s)]
*  He had polio. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2784.6400000000003s)]
*  Are you doubting that he had polio? [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2786.56s)]
*  I have no idea if he had polio. All I can tell you about him is that he shouldn't have been a [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2787.92s)]
*  leader. He knows that. He voted against Bobby. He votes against almost everything now. He's a, [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2791.6800000000003s)]
*  you know, very bitter guy. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2797.36s)]
*  Donald Trump is a Mitch McConnell polio truther. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2799.2s)]
*  Of course he is. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2804.0s)]
*  Mitch McConnell, who voted against RFK Jr. and explained why is partly because he had [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2804.8s)]
*  childhood polio and he thinks that the, you know, Kennedy's stance on vaccines is just [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2810.4s)]
*  outrageous and he couldn't do it. And Donald Trump is like, oh, he had polio? Oh, really? Oh, [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2817.36s)]
*  yeah. I don't know anything about that. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2822.88s)]
*  Prove it. Prove he had polio. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2824.32s)]
*  Prove he had polio. What a, that is just fucking wild. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. I hope all the [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2825.52s)]
*  Mitch McConnell lackeys out there that have become full, full MAGA bros are all happy about that one. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2834.08s)]
*  Now Mitch McConnell doesn't have the authority and power in Congress to [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2841.68s)]
*  hook up all their lobbying clients. They've dropped them. They've dropped them like a dirty [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2846.4s)]
*  sock. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2849.68s)]
*  Embarrassing. Totally embarrassing. And finally, I saved the best for last. Georgia Congressman [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2850.16s)]
*  Buddy Carter gets in on the hot new trend of renaming places we don't own. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2856.0s)]
*  It's a bizarre bill has been introduced in Congress to allow the United States to acquire [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2860.96s)]
*  Greenland and rename it red, white and blue land. The bill was presented by Republican lawmaker [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2865.36s)]
*  Earl Buddy Carter from Georgia. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2871.44s)]
*  Stupidest fucking people. We are, we are, our country is being run by the stupidest fucking [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2873.84s)]
*  people. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2881.6s)]
*  I learned about this directly from you this morning at our production meeting and I laughed so hard. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2883.2s)]
*  I mean, it hurt my guy. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2888.56s)]
*  Well, it happened earlier in the week and I, I made a quick note to myself and my to-do list [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2890.0s)]
*  that just said, don't forget Greenland. Because it just sort of went under the radar as it should [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2895.36s)]
*  have. And there's a lot of other important things and who the, you know, some fucking [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2902.48s)]
*  backbench congressman from Georgia, Republican Yahoo, uh, decided to do it. But wow. Red, white [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2905.2s)]
*  and blue land. Okay. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2911.52s)]
*  It is like, this is obviously freedom fries type stuff. But if you ever just want to [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2912.88s)]
*  just have an interesting experience, find a much younger person and try to explain to them the [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2918.8s)]
*  time in American history, 20 years ago, when we renamed all of our french fries, freedom fries, [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2924.96s)]
*  because France would not follow us into a really stupid and losing war. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2929.2s)]
*  Honestly, it's not going to sound so shocking to them now if they've paid attention to the news [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2932.96s)]
*  in the last several years, they'll think, oh, that seems quaint. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2936.56s)]
*  Well, then actually, if you, if you hear that story, then everything that's happened since [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2939.9199999999996s)]
*  probably makes a lot more sense to you. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2943.68s)]

*  We are recording this before the Trump Modi press conference. And I've been wondering [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2955.6s)]
*  whether there's a chance Trump's going to announce in there. He's going to start calling India, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2960.64s)]
*  Indiana. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=2963.68s)]

*  clarifying that we have big issues that we're going to have to deal with including agencies that this [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3233.6000000000004s)]
*  administration may want to destroy and defund. So two weeks before the election the CFPB put out [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3241.6000000000004s)]
*  a rule to protect consumer privacy that led to praise by the Republican chair of the Financial [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3248.0800000000004s)]
*  Services Committee in the House, a foe of the CFPB for a long time foe, somebody who was when [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3253.84s)]
*  the agency was first proposed got into an argument with Elizabeth Warren before the agency even [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3260.2400000000002s)]
*  existed and she was the creative founder of it. There was a moment where people thought, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3264.96s)]
*  you know what, Republicans are actually going to become populist. Republicans are going to become [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3274.0s)]
*  anti-big tech and now because of what the administration is doing there's a bunch of [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3278.0s)]
*  regulations that would have reigned in big tech on hold specifically on hold at the CFPB. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3284.7200000000003s)]
*  Can you talk about the like long-term impact of this Republican antipathy towards CFPB and then [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3291.28s)]
*  how does that fit in with at least their like public posture of claiming to be these economic [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3300.56s)]
*  populists? Yeah I think that when you really boil it down what you see is that most of the things [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3305.44s)]
*  that the CFPB works on are not particularly sexy in some ways. Your medical bills that are shown up [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3313.12s)]
*  on your credit reports, you know the fees that you're paying on your bank account, [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3321.92s)]
*  how much you're paying for a mortgage or auto loan and really what we did in these past few [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3328.0s)]
*  years was prosecute some of the biggest corporations in the country for cheating people repeatedly. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3334.56s)]
*  So obviously the CFPB's work is pretty popular. It doesn't matter you know what your political [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3342.24s)]
*  affiliation is. The only place it is unpopular is with lobbyists and politicians in Washington [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3348.16s)]
*  and it seems pretty obvious to me that big tech giants who are increasingly entering [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3355.8399999999997s)]
*  banking and payments do not want anyone looking under the hood and do not want to follow the laws [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3364.08s)]
*  of our land. So I think that's really the big question is are we in a moment where they are [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3371.84s)]
*  going to defund the police over Wall Street and Silicon Valley or are they actually going to stand [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3378.1600000000003s)]
*  up for people and lower their costs and I think it's looking more and more like the people are [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3385.6000000000004s)]
*  going to get the short end of the stick on this. Let's just talk actually about the like kind of [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3391.44s)]
*  the specifics here. What happens when I mean CFPB is in the middle of a bunch of investigations, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3396.8s)]
*  there's a bunch of ongoing very important investigations going on right now. What happens [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3402.0s)]
*  if those are just stopped in their tracks? Yeah that would be a big wet kiss to a lot of the [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3406.32s)]
*  defendants who want to get off scot-free. There is active courtroom battles right now on many of the [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3413.44s)]
*  cases we have filed. We sued JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America for their role [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3422.64s)]
*  in fraud on Zelle. We've sued the nation's biggest pawn lender for cheating military families. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3429.92s)]
*  We've sued one of the nation's biggest subprime auto lenders for their misdeeds and the list [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3436.4s)]
*  really goes on and on. There's also advanced investigations against big Wall Street firms and [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3443.12s)]
*  big tech firms that means that that will just stop and it means that we will not be able to get [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3449.36s)]
*  justice and money for the people who have been harmed by that. So Trump just announced the [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3459.2000000000003s)]
*  replacement, your replacement, somebody that was at the FDIC. Now is there any hope that once that [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3465.92s)]
*  person's in place some of these investigations can get unpaused or does the leader not matter [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3474.88s)]
*  when there's such a when you have you know the doge boys scrambling around the basement? I have no [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3480.7200000000003s)]
*  clue. I mean it's all a mystery as to what would happen but ultimately I think you'll see a Senate [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3487.2000000000003s)]
*  confirmation process. I've been through two of them. You get they're hard and I think you'll [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3496.32s)]
*  we'll see a lot of questions as to whether or not the law enforcement mission of the CFPB [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3503.44s)]
*  is going to actually actually be fulfilled. I think people certainly listeners have heard [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3510.7200000000003s)]
*  about the various successes of the CFPB of clawing money back. What is one of the most like just [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3516.88s)]
*  shocking and egregious kinds of fraud you've seen? Not from I think people who [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3523.36s)]
*  people just for lack of a better term expect it from payday lenders. They expect it from sort [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3529.04s)]
*  of skeezy financial institutions but from big blue chip companies that are supposed to be [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3534.16s)]
*  respectable. What's the most disgusting or outrageous thing you guys were able to find? [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3539.2s)]
*  I mean I could go for a whole hour on this. We've seen everything. We've actually seen [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3543.7599999999998s)]
*  people charge fees. One of them a paper statement fee where the company didn't even print anything [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3551.68s)]
*  or mail anything. Those are small. They're egregious but you know maybe it's not going [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3557.76s)]
*  to affect someone's financial life that much. The thing that I think is so high stakes [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3564.8s)]
*  actually relates more to health care. You have so many people whether it's an emergency room visit [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3570.7200000000003s)]
*  or they have a chronic condition whatever it may be they deal with this slew of paperwork and bills [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3578.32s)]
*  where they are they're covered by insurance and get stuck in this doom loop between the [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3587.2s)]
*  insurance company, the provider, the facility, the long list of players and you know what happens [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3593.44s)]
*  their medical bill gets parked on their credit report and all of a sudden they can't pass maybe [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3602.2400000000002s)]
*  even employment verification checks or can't get an apartment, can't get a loan because of a sickness [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3609.2s)]
*  that they've had and for a bill that they do not even owe. I think a lot of people are sick and [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3616.4s)]
*  tired that these credit reporting conglomerates, Experian, TransUnion and Equifax have so much [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3623.6s)]
*  power over what happens to in our financial life and in some cases don't take the basic steps [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3633.92s)]
*  to make sure that the information on your credit report is real. Allowing people to put phantom [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3641.92s)]
*  debt or park it on the credit report as a means to coerce you into paying a bill you don't owe [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3649.1200000000003s)]
*  I think is absolutely egregious. The CFPB finalized a rule to ban that practice [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3656.4s)]
*  and I hope that it actually takes effect. And those rules obviously I think the future is [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3664.1600000000003s)]
*  unknown here but like telling people to stay home trying to gut the agency are some of these [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3670.48s)]
*  rules still going to keep moving forward passively or does it require are they able are they by [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3676.48s)]
*  sending people home are they stopping those rules right now? Well someone needs to enforce those [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3682.88s)]
*  rules but we also have seen reporting that they've instructed the staff to try and delay them [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3687.76s)]
*  to make sure that they never see reality. Or maybe if the CFPB has been sued by these big industry [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3695.12s)]
*  players to stop it maybe they just won't defend against that. So to me I think there's just like [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3706.88s)]
*  makes your blood boil. But that's why this matters so much is that maybe it's small this issue of a [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3713.52s)]
*  credit report but for somebody who's dealing with it in the moment it is a big big deal. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3719.6s)]
*  You know maybe that one single overdraft fee doesn't matter to a person but for somebody [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3725.92s)]
*  who got hit with four fees rather than one it can send them on a treadmill of debt. Maybe [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3731.2799999999997s)]
*  one student loan payment being misallocated is not a big deal but when they screw up your entire loan [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3738.08s)]
*  so that you don't get to qualify for a public service cancellation that's a big deal. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3745.68s)]
*  It's just it's that like that you know we're in this moment where you know oh Democrats are [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3752.0s)]
*  falling into a trap of defending institutions and it's like man this is I know people don't [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3756.8799999999997s)]
*  don't believe government works for them but I think a lot of that is people have no fucking idea [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3762.48s)]
*  that this is happening and like this to me is like if there's anything you would want your [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3766.16s)]
*  government to do it is to have a consumer watchdog empowered with enough force and might to [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3770.72s)]
*  actually take on these institutions and win. It's an extraordinary it's an extraordinary story of [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3776.9599999999996s)]
*  government at its best and I'm glad to hear you still think there's value in telling that story [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3783.6s)]
*  right now. Yeah and I hear every day we would get thousands of people who would file [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3789.4399999999996s)]
*  complaints with us on our website and what was great is it didn't go into some black hole. We [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3796.8s)]
*  actually sent it to the company and told the company respond and without really any resources [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3802.16s)]
*  at all other than that you know the tech that we created people every day were getting refunds they [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3809.6s)]
*  were getting their credit report fixed sometimes they saved their home or their car and for those [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3816.08s)]
*  individuals you hear you I read the letters that they would send about finally they felt like their [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3821.76s)]
*  government was doing something that they really benefited from and I think that's just so important [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3830.88s)]
*  that we demonstrate we don't do this just because there's some acronym that maybe people won't [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3837.76s)]
*  remember we do it because we want to give people power and dignity in their life and I think that's [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3844.48s)]
*  exactly what the CFPB has done for so many. Well I called the the CFPB helpline before we recorded [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3850.16s)]
*  and I called it during business hours and it is no longer open right now that number needs to go [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3857.04s)]
*  straight to voicemail so they have they are trying to stop people from having that experience which [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3862.56s)]
*  I think tells you a lot. Well that sounds like censorship to me. Yeah censorship. Nine days before [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3867.3599999999997s)]
*  Elon's Doge initiative got into the CFPB Musk made a deal with Visa to add a digital wallet feature [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3873.76s)]
*  to X as part of a broader plan to turn it into an everything app. It seems like a lot of inspiration [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3880.88s)]
*  is being drawn by these Chinese from these Chinese super apps there's WeChat there's Alipay [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3887.36s)]
*  and I want to get your sense on what the dangers are there especially if there isn't a active CFPB. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3892.16s)]
*  Yeah so I think everyone realizes there is a totally different way that we pay for things [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3900.16s)]
*  now when we go in the store we tap online it's different there's a whole set of new choices [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3906.24s)]
*  but here's what's really shifting. The more and more that tech companies and big financial firms [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3912.3999999999996s)]
*  know about our purchase history know our transaction history know our location know our friends and [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3921.8399999999997s)]
*  social networking the more and more we are going to creep into a world where there aren't price tags [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3929.2s)]
*  for goods but instead we're going to have surveillance based personal pricing based on [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3936.72s)]
*  our mood based on what we're searching for and you see a lot of big companies Google [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3943.2s)]
*  Facebook wanted to create its own currency in fact and now we're seeing how even X even Twitter [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3950.64s)]
*  wants to be a way that you can move money and pay and there's enormous value in all of that and you [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3957.6s)]
*  know I don't know I cannot I have no idea if Doge is there to snoop or to find out what its [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3964.88s)]
*  competitors are up to to find out the plans that other companies have I just don't know but certainly [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3974.96s)]
*  that is something that many are worried about. So this would be like just as people understand [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3982.48s)]
*  what's so bad about that right like what's so bad about having like surge pricing for pizza or like [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3987.12s)]
*  Google knows that Google knows based on my mood or whether or not I've had an edible [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3991.92s)]
*  how much I want this take out right now like what what's the negative consequence of having [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=3997.44s)]
*  these companies with this level of access to data? Well I certainly think that for those of us who [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4003.36s)]
*  have serious medical diagnoses when we're targeted or charge different prices because they know we [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4008.48s)]
*  certain medication or we they know we need certain medical supplies or for teenagers who are maybe [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4016.7200000000003s)]
*  in a rough rough place personally being able to target them with certain information or to be [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4024.2400000000002s)]
*  able to extract from them from older adults who might be lonely I think actually the price tag [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4031.76s)]
*  is probably one of the best consumer protections we have out there and when we individualize every [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4038.8s)]
*  single price we're setting ourselves up for an economy that I don't think we want. I've long been [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4045.36s)]
*  worried about people who call for an Uber or Lyft and late at night that maybe a woman calling [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4051.1200000000003s)]
*  ride shares getting a higher price than a male in the same exact place or that there are ways to [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4062.2400000000002s)]
*  discriminate based on our personal characteristics and I also don't think that we want these big [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4069.52s)]
*  companies knowing everything that goes on in our life before we are about to purchase something. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4076.56s)]
*  Well this is this is why this is why they were afraid of you you know Mark Zuckerberg in a recent [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4082.48s)]
*  interview he did this kind of aw shucks routine about like it was so weird all of a sudden CFPB [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4088.4s)]
*  was looking into into Facebook which doesn't make sense because we're not a bank and he [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4095.28s)]
*  kind of implies that what if he or suggests that it might have been political in some way you [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4100.16s)]
*  talked about the fact that they were introducing a currency which would obviously be a reason for [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4104.96s)]
*  them to be looked at but like beyond that like why would CFPB need to be a watchdog when it's [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4109.4400000000005s)]
*  supposed to be a consumer financial protection agency why would it have to go after Facebook? [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4117.92s)]
*  We're supposed to police banking lending and payments and when companies like Facebook are [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4121.84s)]
*  creating their own currency and fortunately it got killed but you see more of these big giants [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4130.400000000001s)]
*  lurching into lending and payments it's not the CFPB expanding into tech it's these companies [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4138.16s)]
*  expanding into the core work that we do so it is true that Google actually sued us because we were [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4144.48s)]
*  asking questions or wanted to ask questions about how they were handling people's money and their [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4153.36s)]
*  data so I think that this is really about power is that there are certain companies who feel [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4159.36s)]
*  that they should not have to follow the laws that our congress passes that they are somehow special [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4166.879999999999s)]
*  that there is an exemption for fancy technology but I think we as people should want a lot of [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4173.28s)]
*  technological progress but not if it comes at the expense of our dignity our democracy and frankly [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4180.08s)]
*  fairness in our economy. And like you've been accused of being anti-tech or you know sort of [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4187.44s)]
*  anti-capitalist or whatever it may be because of this position but you were a McKinsey person or [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4193.44s)]
*  yeah it's funny I think it's I actually think most business people want there to be some rule of law. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4198.72s)]
*  But that's what I was going to say like presumably these companies would like to compete on a level [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4207.280000000001s)]
*  playing field in which they don't have to find this don't have to be in a kind of race to find [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4211.4400000000005s)]
*  the most kind of invasive forms of data monitoring or the most kind of rapacious kind of pricing [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4216.4800000000005s)]
*  presumably some of these companies would be interested in having a clear set of rules that [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4223.6s)]
*  they know allows them to compete without having to do these kinds of things. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4228.0s)]
*  Actually I really feel for all the businesses out there who sometimes think that they're chumps [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4231.28s)]
*  because they're following the law especially small players while big giants can break the law with [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4239.2s)]
*  impunity pay a fine and move on. I mean you asked about Facebook when I was an FTC commissioner [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4246.56s)]
*  Facebook was embroiled in a scandal related to Cambridge Analytica it had flagrantly violated [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4254.64s)]
*  an FTC law enforcement order and what happened was that they paid billions of dollars so that [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4262.24s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg and other executives could get an immunity clause in the settlement. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4269.52s)]
*  And I actually think most people it's not just everyday citizens it's even business owners [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4275.28s)]
*  are asking themselves how do these big CEOs seem to always get off scot-free. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4281.68s)]
*  You know after the financial crisis John it felt like there was absolutely no accountability [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4288.88s)]
*  millions of people lost their home but barely any executives were held accountable in fact their [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4295.200000000001s)]
*  companies were bailed out and they got bigger and I think that's just fundamentally wrong. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4301.4400000000005s)]
*  Are there any lessons you have from being at CFPB? You know there's a way in which right now [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4307.360000000001s)]
*  I think it feels a little bit like oh Democrats are we didn't know you could just dispatch [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4311.84s)]
*  your favorite billionaire into the bowels of every agency and start slashing and burning things that [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4317.280000000001s)]
*  you don't like. Obviously we have this very difficult challenge the classic challenge of [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4322.320000000001s)]
*  we are trying to defend democracy and one of the ways we're trying to do that is to demonstrate why [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4329.12s)]
*  the rules are important which means we're following rules that the other side doesn't [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4334.4s)]
*  and we're trying to defend the game and you can't defend the game while while breaking the rules [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4337.839999999999s)]
*  because then you're no longer playing the game but are there ways in which looking back you think [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4342.24s)]
*  man if I knew how bad this was going to be I would have pushed harder here I would have fought this [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4346.799999999999s)]
*  harder we we were a little too conciliatory here we were trying to reach compromise with the [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4351.2s)]
*  Republicans there are any places like that where you look back and think the lesson for me here is [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4355.759999999999s)]
*  we should have gone harder? Well you always have some regrets and I think when it comes down to it [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4359.36s)]
*  there is so much abuse of power by some of the biggest powerful companies and it takes a lot of [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4367.92s)]
*  effort to stand up to that and prosecute that when they violate the law and we could always use more [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4376.32s)]
*  energy from the public to unearth that fraud so yeah I mean look at the end of the day we always [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4383.44s)]
*  made sure that we were following every law and we did and I don't regret any of that I think we [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4392.48s)]
*  cannot have a strong society if individuals feel that they can just sidestep the laws of the land. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4399.36s)]
*  So one aspect of CFPB that's hard to measure is where it has had an impact by scaring institutions [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4407.04s)]
*  preemptively from doing shady stuff with fees misleading rules interest rates whatever it may be. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4414.4s)]
*  What are you worried about right now that like you know banks that are that some of these that [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4423.76s)]
*  are like kind of raptors testing the fences what is the next iteration of consumer abuses that [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4427.76s)]
*  you're worried about? Well you know it's really interesting when I got actually to both the FTC [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4434.32s)]
*  and the CFPB it really was so clear to me that it was a sleep at the wheel I mean we saw so much [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4440.96s)]
*  crime against consumers that really it was almost a catch and release policy you find them and you [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4451.28s)]
*  let them go and I do think that just having someone who is a watchdog it actually does scare [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4459.52s)]
*  off some of the worst worst abuses against people and this is why I really do think that corporate [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4470.240000000001s)]
*  law enforcement where people can actually stop those abuses it doesn't just it's not just the [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4476.96s)]
*  tens of billions of dollars we've gotten back for people but we have stopped market abuses like we [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4484.400000000001s)]
*  saw in the financial crisis that destroyed trillions of wealth you know and led to so [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4491.12s)]
*  many people losing their homes and look John you ask like what what are we learning from this moment? [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4496.400000000001s)]
*  I do think that there are sometimes places where we need to say openly this part of government [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4503.12s)]
*  isn't working that was certainly true in the start of the CFPB we actually shut down a corrupt [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4510.0s)]
*  and failed agency called the office of thrift supervision and created a new one. I remember [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4516.88s)]
*  when the letters came down off the building. Yeah and I do think sometimes we got to find places [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4522.56s)]
*  that aren't working and shut them down but when we do it it's because we are doing it [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4528.16s)]
*  to serve people better not to serve the powerful even more. Are there ways you're worried about AI [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4535.200000000001s)]
*  being used to to harm consumers in a way that like the CFPB could have protected against or [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4541.360000000001s)]
*  could protect against in the future? Well one thing that we have not really reigned in enough is [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4545.68s)]
*  the explosion of chat bots and now when you are struggling with something it is very hard to [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4552.72s)]
*  talk to someone to fix it you're often speaking to a chat bot the CFPB when I was there we did [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4560.8s)]
*  a study of these chat bots that banks use and they all had these real these these human like [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4567.2s)]
*  names for example Bank of America called their chat bot Erica and you ask you say to them [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4575.04s)]
*  something is wrong this is not my I did not make this charge this the my payment was in process [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4582.8s)]
*  right and sometimes you just want to get things fixed and instead you feel like you're in a doom [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4590.96s)]
*  loop with the chat bot where you're saying something and they're saying the same thing back to you. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4597.12s)]
*  We also really worry about AI being used to impersonate people a lot of older adults in our [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4603.360000000001s)]
*  country are getting very realistic texts calls that are mimicking the voices of their loved ones [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4610.96s)]
*  and I think that that's a place where there's a lot we can do with technological progress to make [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4621.12s)]
*  life better but we should not dilute ourselves that it can also be used as a weapon and it can [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4627.6s)]
*  also be used as a tool by foreign nations that are seeking to do our people harm. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4633.76s)]
*  So when Elon Musk posted delete CFPB on social media he replied to someone and I'm it is you know [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4642.08s)]
*  an unfortunate reality of our current dystopia that I have to like describe in detail the post [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4651.12s)]
*  of this unelected billionaire but he put he said with such such generosity CFPB has done a non-zero [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4656.08s)]
*  amount of good or something to that effect. Have you considered trying to reach out to him have [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4664.32s)]
*  you reached out to him have you spoken to him about this and is and if you did or could what [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4669.04s)]
*  would you want to convey? Well I guess my view is that I don't think any of us should be groveling [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4674.48s)]
*  to billionaires to save our country. We should believe that people control our country and I [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4682.88s)]
*  think we should be worried that when there is a click of CEOs that seem to call the shots [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4692.5599999999995s)]
*  and frankly I do think that that's part of the problems that not only that everyone is worried [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4700.24s)]
*  about when it comes to the massive mismatch in power it's why I think so many of us are huge fans [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4707.04s)]
*  of Lena Kahn and all the work she has done to really challenge that power and I think that that [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4714.24s)]
*  is going to be something that we have to continue to do. We shouldn't be asking these individuals [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4721.04s)]
*  for permission they are not our elected officials. Well you could just have to fuck off. Well look [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4728.48s)]
*  it's very clear that there are individuals who have an agenda and they're going to pursue that [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4734.72s)]
*  and it's going to take us to make sure that people are following the law and and we're using our own [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4742.88s)]
*  voices and our own power. You're not giving me you're not giving me an inch on this. Well look I mean [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4749.44s)]
*  do I like what he says about the CFPB? No but I don't think we should be saying you know he [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4755.36s)]
*  he may have his own motives for this but it's up to us to make sure that we can rein that power in [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4763.44s)]
*  not ask them to just be nice. Well for sure it's a pretty worrying time for people at the agency. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4771.44s)]
*  What's your message? It's a like it's a group of dedicated non-partisan people who are there to [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4777.12s)]
*  kind of protect the interests of consumers. It's returned an extraordinary amount of money to [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4783.44s)]
*  consumers. I like it's hard to come up with a better example of government that is currently [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4788.4s)]
*  being lied about and undermined by this unelected clique. There are people in that agency that are [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4794.64s)]
*  worried about people have been fired they're worried about being fired they don't know whether [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4801.92s)]
*  or not the right thing to do for their families is to try to stay and fight or leave if there is [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4805.76s)]
*  some kind of an offer to get out. What is your message to the people at your former agency? [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4811.2s)]
*  Well look at all people all across our government. There are people who specialize in certain roles [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4817.76s)]
*  some of them prosecute terrorism. You can't really do that in the private sector. There are just some [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4826.56s)]
*  things that are done for the public's sake and I think that this is a moment where it's really [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4834.0s)]
*  hard to tell them what they should do because they have to really live their life and I always [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4841.28s)]
*  encourage them to serve as long as you possibly can. But look this is a real moment for everybody [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4848.64s)]
*  who is trying to serve the public. I think that it forces all of us to reflect on how do we talk [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4856.96s)]
*  about those who serve the public. I can tell you a lot of people who work at the CFPB can make a lot [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4866.4800000000005s)]
*  more money if they were in the private sector and many of them choose to do that work because they [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4874.72s)]
*  believe that people shouldn't be treated poorly by a bank or a mortgage company or a student lender [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4882.16s)]
*  because it's about people's personal dignity and they believe it so deeply. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4889.84s)]
*  After you cracked down on ITT Technical Institute for its illegal recruiting tactics the former [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4894.08s)]
*  chief executive called you an economic terrorist who should be sent to Guantanamo Bay for about a [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4898.5599999999995s)]
*  decade of R&R which should include an aggressive regiment of water sports. So what is your favorite [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4902.72s)]
*  water sport? Sometimes in this business there will be CEOs that threaten you, that hire people [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4909.2s)]
*  to follow you and it's pretty damn scary but we just got to keep going because we know that these [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4922.16s)]
*  individuals clearly feel that the law doesn't apply to them and that their answer when we ask [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4933.28s)]
*  questions is to tell people that they were to fundamentally threaten their lives and I think [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4942.0s)]
*  it's pretty disgusting. You ran this agency that has been that has survived [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4948.16s)]
*  a concerted effort by major financial interests, lobbyists, right-wing conservatives, Republicans [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4953.12s)]
*  to destroy it. First of all they tried to make it so it couldn't exist. They wouldn't let Elizabeth [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4965.04s)]
*  Warren run it from the jump. They have lied about it from the beginning claiming it's a sludge fund [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4969.12s)]
*  which is a lie, claiming it's trying to debank conservatives which is a lie, right? Actually [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4973.759999999999s)]
*  exactly the opposite. We put into place policies to block that and the bank lobby sued us for it. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4978.48s)]
*  What right now do you see as the most hopeful path for the CFPB to survive until [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4987.2s)]
*  a time in which we can put a leader in charge of it who believes in it? [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=4997.36s)]
*  Well it's really what the public says and does and calls their members about what they protest. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=5002.16s)]
*  We need everyone's voices and I you know John I think a lot of people including many people [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=5014.8s)]
*  who probably listen they probably feel pretty fatigued. They feel beat down. They feel like [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=5020.4s)]
*  this is such a chaotic moment and they just need a break and I understand that. I know how that can [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=5029.84s)]
*  feel but I also feel like it's so important to remember why we love this place, this country, [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=5038.16s)]
*  and part of it is because we can fight back and really make sure that we do not lose the things [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=5046.88s)]
*  that are so important and I just think that's really important to remember even when times are [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=5053.44s)]
*  really tough. And I just think it's really impressive that you simply will not acknowledge [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=5058.72s)]
*  how maybe cathartic it could be to tell you I must go fuck himself. Well if even if it is [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=5064.320000000001s)]
*  I think that I'm not going to dignify any individual billionaire and their that what they want to [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=5072.400000000001s)]
*  dictate about our country because the whole whole game of why this country is better is because [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=5079.52s)]
*  we're not supposed to allow that to happen. We fought hard for one person to have one vote. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=5087.6s)]
*  We fought hard to make sure that we weren't being controlled by royalty and that's maybe [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=5093.52s)]
*  some of those lessons are applied today too. Rohit Chopra thank you so much for your time. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=5100.240000000001s)]
*  Thanks so much John. That's our show for today. Thanks to Rohit Chopra for joining us here in [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-ULkc0nAw&t=5104.400000000001s)]
