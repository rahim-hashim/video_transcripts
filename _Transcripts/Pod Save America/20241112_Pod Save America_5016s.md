Video Description: Trump begins staffing top roles in his second administration with loyalists and sycophants—and demands that the senators running for Majority Leader agree to embrace a process that would allow him to appoint whoever he wants without Senate confirmation. Jon, Lovett, and Tommy discuss whether Trump's opening moves are as chilling as we thought they'd be, what we do and don't know about his second-term plans, and how he might pursue revenge on his opponents. Then, Tommy speaks with New York Congressman Pat Ryan, who hung on in a tough district, about the lessons the Democratic Party needs to learn in order to win.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Donald Trump Reveals Some Awful First Staffers For His Next Administration
**Pod Save America:** [November 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE)
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Jon Favreau. I'm Jon Lovett. I'm Tommy Vitor. On today's show Trump starts staffing his administration with some of the worst people you know. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=0.0s)]
*  And he also wants a Senate majority leader who will let him appoint whoever he wants for his cabinet, administration, and even the judiciary without any Senate confirmation. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=8.0s)]
*  We'll also get into what we know and still don't know about Trump's plans for his second term, including the prospects for exacting revenge on his political enemies. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=17.0s)]
*  Then New York Congressman Pat Ryan, one of the Dems who hung on in a very tough district by quite a lot, stops by to talk to Tommy about how he pulled it off and what lessons the party needs to learn if we want to actually hold power again. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=25.0s)]
*  Wouldn't that be nice? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=38.0s)]
*  That's pronounced power? Power. Power. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=40.0s)]
*  But first, votes are still being counted in key Senate and House races. Here's what we know as of Monday afternoon California time. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=44.0s)]
*  In the Senate, Ruben Gallego has just about won in Arizona, though the race hasn't been officially called by anyone but Decision Desk HQ. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=52.0s)]
*  He's got it. I think Kerry Lake's run out of runway there with the votes coming in. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=60.0s)]
*  Bob Casey is still behind in Pennsylvania, and while the AP has called the race, many other outlets have not, and Casey hasn't conceded because of the amount of votes still out there. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=66.0s)]
*  There's like a hundred thousand votes. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=76.0s)]
*  That's a lot of votes that have been counted. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=78.0s)]
*  Take your time. Take your time. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=80.0s)]
*  California's districts are like 38%, 45%. What's going on here? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=84.0s)]
*  I know. Well, you know, it's Northern California that's the real problem. LA County is doing much better than like Alameda's like at 40%. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=88.0s)]
*  What's going on up there? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=96.0s)]
*  I don't know. Consequently, Chuck Schumer did not invite Casey's Republican challenger, Dave McCormick, to Senate orientation, though he didn't invite Gallego either. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=97.0s)]
*  I'm not even going to get into that. Again, we're talking here about a 47 seat minority versus a 48 seat minority for Democrats. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=107.0s)]
*  In the House, unfortunately, the fight to eke out a Democratic majority is all but over. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=115.0s)]
*  Colorado Democrat Yadira Caraveo conceded her race. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=122.0s)]
*  The count right now, according to the AP, is 204 Democrats to 214 Republicans, with 17 seats still undetermined. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=125.0s)]
*  Democrats might still win a bunch of these uncalled races, but right now it's looking like a very narrow Republican majority, maybe even just one or two seats smaller than last time, but still a majority. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=134.0s)]
*  Anything you guys have seen out there about the race counts that's particularly hopeful or interesting? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=144.0s)]
*  Nothing hopeful on the majority front, to be honest. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=148.0s)]
*  I mean, there was a glimmer of hope in one of the California races we're waiting on, which is George Whitesides is a little ahead at the moment. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=150.0s)]
*  The Republican incumbent Mike Garcia won that seat by six points in 2022, which gave me a little hope maybe that like Derek Tran, Dave Minn, Will Rollins, and the other California Dems that we're waiting on vote totals for might pull it out, but we don't know. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=158.0s)]
*  I know. I saw that like Derek Tran had a couple good ballot dumps, and then I think he fell behind again against Michelle Steele. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=173.0s)]
*  I do think one just like, look, there's been a lot of quick and dirty takes about does field matter, does organizing matter, and then you look and you see Dave Minn may eke it out. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=181.0s)]
*  Some of those races in Nevada were going to eke it out, and you just think like those house races where a bunch of people from that listen to the show got on buses and went and knocked on doors, like it will make the difference and it will make Republicans jobs harder. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=190.0s)]
*  Also with Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin, Alyssa Slockin in Michigan, we had a number of Senate candidates who just, you know, Jackie Rosen in Nevada who like hung on by the skin of their teeth. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=201.0s)]
*  Good candidates, good campaigns do matter. I mean, Kerry Lake is going to underperform Donald Trump by eight points. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=210.0s)]
*  And what's an enormous margin, which is some of the worst underperformance of any other Republican except Deb Fisher, who underperformed in relation because of Dan Osborne and Ted Cruz. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=216.0s)]
*  Ted Cruz, Ted Cruz underperformed Trump by more than Kerry Lake. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=229.0s)]
*  I want Colin to run back in an off year. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=233.0s)]
*  I know that's what makes you think like if Colin Allred was running in a midterm, like he could have done it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=235.0s)]
*  So we saw how difficult it was for Mike Johnson to get things through the last Congress, and his margin this time might be even tighter. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=245.0s)]
*  A two or three seat majority in the Senate isn't that big either. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=252.0s)]
*  How are you guys thinking about how much the final numbers matter here and sort of the margins the Republicans will have in both houses? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=255.0s)]
*  A very slim majority is tough to manage. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=261.0s)]
*  And we've seen Speaker Johnson fumble the bag over the last couple of years a few times. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=263.0s)]
*  That said, I'm worried that Johnson's job gets easier when he feels that he is implementing the Trump agenda or when Trump feels like he is implementing the Trump agenda. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=267.0s)]
*  And he has a bunch of members who are worried primarily about Trump figuring out a primary challenger to them if they don't go along with what he says. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=276.0s)]
*  Now, long term, that means that you could have a bunch of moderates taking a lot of bad votes that hurt them in the midterms. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=284.0s)]
*  So that's a reason to be hopeful two years from now. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=291.0s)]
*  But in the short term, it feels like they will be a little more pliant. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=295.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. I'm not I'm not sure. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=298.0s)]
*  Look, I think a slimmer majority is better. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=301.0s)]
*  There will be I think it also I think depends on what happens with Trump's popularity, right? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=303.0s)]
*  Like what happens as he starts to implement other policies that start to draw a backlash? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=309.0s)]
*  I also think how the Senate just how pliant the Senate is matters, right? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=313.0s)]
*  Because you could imagine House Republicans kind of just passing things along. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=318.0s)]
*  And then the hope is that they get killed in the Senate. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=323.0s)]
*  But I'm not as sure of that this time when you have we'll get to it. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=325.0s)]
*  But Republican candidates for majority leader kind of bending over backwards to suck Trump's cock. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=328.0s)]
*  So it's very like sort of please, please, please, sir. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=332.0s)]
*  You know, and so I don't know. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=337.0s)]
*  Twenty twenty four is a different vibe. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=339.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's trying to be the liberal Joe Rogan over here. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=341.0s)]
*  Classic bro, such a bro. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=344.0s)]
*  Do you think do you think that I wouldn't when I guess I wouldn't have said that a Kamala one. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=348.0s)]
*  But I would have said it before. True. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=354.0s)]
*  Yeah, Trump is basically we'll get into this, but it's basically going to be running the House and the Senate. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=357.0s)]
*  Right. He's never been known to be a master legislator. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=362.0s)]
*  So that's cause for hope. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=365.0s)]
*  And I do think like Tommy said, a lot of these Republican, I don't even want to call them moderates. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=367.0s)]
*  We'll call them frontline members. Sure. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=371.0s)]
*  But they are going to be very vulnerable in twenty twenty six. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=373.0s)]
*  And it's going to be, you know, either either like the rest of the House and Senate bend to their will to try to keep them from losing in twenty twenty six. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=376.0s)]
*  Or what's more likely in the Republican Party, they just make them take all those bad votes. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=387.0s)]
*  Well, I think what what I what I suspect, because I do think they're going to be very worried about drawing the evil eye, as Tommy mentioned, but at the same time, they are going to be afraid of taking some really hard votes as you see kind of behind the scenes wrangling to try to kind of take out the most offensive parts of some of these proposals and then and then get them through. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=392.0s)]
*  And Trump doesn't give a fuck. So it's clear victory until Trump makes them pass the no elections until I say so. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=409.0s)]
*  Act of twenty twenty four. Yeah, I do think I'm worried about again in the Senate is forty seven versus forty eight here. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=414.0s)]
*  So you've got to think the Republican majority in the Senate is built on having Susan Collins, who's going to be up again and maybe retiring and has always been more moderate than the rest of her colleagues. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=420.0s)]
*  Lisa Murkowski, same thing. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=434.0s)]
*  So on some of the real crazy shit, you may lose Collins and Murkowski, Tom Thomas and Tom Tillis. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=436.0s)]
*  Right. Who's going to be up in North Carolina, a state that when all is said and done, looks like it performed better than some of the other swing states like Arizona and and didn't swing nearly as much to the right as the rest of the country. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=442.0s)]
*  So, you know, those three are people to watch or senators to watch on some of the again, they're going to go along with most of the shit. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=456.0s)]
*  But on some of the truly crazy shit, I would watch those three and figure out the final count is just really see how much trouble we're in. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=462.0s)]
*  One thing we do know about the new Trumpy or Republican Senate is that it's going to be very easy for Trump to get his top positions filled with whoever he wants. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=471.0s)]
*  Trump has already made quite a few staff announcements. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=480.0s)]
*  Campaign manager Suzy Wiles will be his White House chief of staff, a position that does not require Senate confirmation. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=483.0s)]
*  Essentially, Wiles has already served as Trump's chief of staff since twenty twenty one when he was in political exile in Florida, even from Republicans in the wake of January 6th. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=489.0s)]
*  She's a former lobbyist known for working behind the scenes. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=498.0s)]
*  She's like a very well known, very well respected political operative in Florida, maybe one of the best political operatives in Florida. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=501.0s)]
*  Even Democrats have praised her skills. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=510.0s)]
*  Yeah, but second place is just an alligator with a hat. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=512.0s)]
*  And of course, she's being given credit for running Trump's most disciplined campaign yet. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=516.0s)]
*  How are we feeling about Suzy Wiles, guys? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=521.0s)]
*  I mean, take away. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=524.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=525.0s)]
*  How are we feeling, Suze? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=526.0s)]
*  I think he chose a confidant and a mega insider versus a relative outsider like even Reince Priebus, John Kelly, Mick Mulvaney, Mark Meadows, previous chiefs of staff. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=527.0s)]
*  Those guys were seen as knowing how the party worked or Congress worked or being a general that could like install discipline in some way. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=536.0s)]
*  And she's just you know, she's a well known Republican, but someone who is a part of Maggot world and respected and apparently the Don Jr. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=542.0s)]
*  And the kids wanted her to get the job. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=550.0s)]
*  So I could view it two ways like the glass half full version is she's not a total right wing ideologue. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=552.0s)]
*  It could have been Stephen Miller, who will be her deputy. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=558.0s)]
*  That really sucks. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=560.0s)]
*  But, you know, it could have been worse. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=561.0s)]
*  Wiles was once a moderate. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=562.0s)]
*  She started working with Jack Kemp to the beginning of her career. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=565.0s)]
*  I don't know what she believes now. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=567.0s)]
*  The glass half empty version, though, is that she has proven to be incredibly effective and she could be the kind of person that helps them get done things they failed to get done last time because Steve Bannon and Jared Kushner were fighting in the news or whatever. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=569.0s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=582.0s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=583.0s)]
*  So it's a question of whether she survives all of those other assholes and the knife fighting and all that kind of stuff. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=584.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was sort of what I went back and looked at. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=590.0s)]
*  What the write ups were when Reince Priebus was named. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=593.0s)]
*  We forget how far the Republican Party has shifted to Trump because a lot of that discussion was about how Priebus was an olive branch to House Republicans and Senate Republicans. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=596.0s)]
*  He was an establishment person. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=607.0s)]
*  And my fear about someone like Suzy Wiles is in the first Trump administration, you had the establishment types that were there in their minds to kind of straitjacket Trump. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=609.0s)]
*  And then you have the kooks who were there to let Trump loose, but were pretty incompetent. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=619.0s)]
*  And I feel like now not only does Trump have control of the Republican Party, he's know all of the branches needed. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=623.0s)]
*  In fact, the branches are coming the other fucking direction. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=628.0s)]
*  It's more competent advisors who believe it is their job to implement Trump's vision. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=630.0s)]
*  And that to me is what's scary about Suzy Wiles because she does. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=638.0s)]
*  She is just a behind the scenes operator. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=641.0s)]
*  She is a former lobbyist. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=643.0s)]
*  By the way, that's a word that I would be using more that Suzy Wiles is a lobbyist. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=645.0s)]
*  Drain the swamp. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=649.0s)]
*  But yeah, that was my concern. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=651.0s)]
*  Pinning all my hopes on Suzy Wiles, it shows you how bad everything is. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=654.0s)]
*  You know, I'm like, it is. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=657.0s)]
*  It's like what I rather Suzy Wiles in charge than Stephen Miller or Stephen Bannon. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=659.0s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=662.0s)]
*  Michael Cruz at Politico had a great profile of her in April, very long profile in Politico. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=663.0s)]
*  She also worked for Romney. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=668.0s)]
*  She met Romney at some point. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=670.0s)]
*  She's a self-described moderate working for Trump. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=671.0s)]
*  First woman to ever be Chief of Staff. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=674.0s)]
*  That is shocking. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=676.0s)]
*  Also, Pat Somerall's daughter. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=677.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=679.0s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=680.0s)]
*  A lot of that profile was about sort of her relationship with him. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=681.0s)]
*  Carlos Cribelo, who's the former Republican congressman from Florida who lost and then became sort of an ever Trumper, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=684.0s)]
*  said if Donald Trump is going to be president, I want Suzy Wiles involved. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=692.0s)]
*  So, you know, on the scale from inmates running the asylum to Committee to Save America. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=695.0s)]
*  Remember Committee to Save America? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=701.0s)]
*  They're back. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=702.0s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=703.0s)]
*  You know, the first time around, I'll tell you though, I was, we all did this. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=704.0s)]
*  We're like, oh, the Committee to Save America. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=708.0s)]
*  They suck. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=709.0s)]
*  Why don't they just come out and say he's awful and resign and all their excuses about we're just there to try to prevent the bad stuff from happening. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=710.0s)]
*  I've had a bit of a change of heart. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=717.0s)]
*  Now, if there's people there who want to be the Committee to Save America and want to try to stop bad things from happening, you stick around. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=718.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=724.0s)]
*  Stick around. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=725.0s)]
*  Do your best. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=726.0s)]
*  Do your best because one of Suzy Wiles' deputies will be Santa Monica's own Stephen Miller. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=727.0s)]
*  Trump's former head speechwriter, who will now have the title deputy chief of staff for policy. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=732.0s)]
*  He'll be in charge of Trump's deportation agenda along with Tom Homan, who's Trump's former acting head of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, who will now be Trump's border czar. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=736.0s)]
*  Homan is out there acknowledging that the deportations will be large scale. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=747.0s)]
*  But he told Fox News on Sunday it's going to be a, quote, humane operation. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=751.0s)]
*  And the Sunday Times of London that their first, quote, going to concentrate on the worst of the worst and that it's going to be a lot different to what the liberal media is saying it's going to be. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=755.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=765.0s)]
*  Any idea what you guys think this might look like in reality? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=766.0s)]
*  I mean, I think this is sort of the worst case when it comes to immigration. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=768.0s)]
*  I talked to Jacob Soboroff a couple of weeks ago on Pod Save the World. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=772.0s)]
*  He is a great NBC reporter who did a lot of reporting about the family separation policy. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=775.0s)]
*  And he said that Tom Homan was one of the main drivers of family separation in the Trump administration. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=780.0s)]
*  And the combination of Tom Homan and Stephen Miller make me fear the absolute worst when it comes to immigration and mass deportation. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=786.0s)]
*  And I think it's just good to remember that mass deportation is family separation on steroids. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=794.0s)]
*  And Homan has vowed to run, quote, the biggest deportation force this country has ever seen. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=800.0s)]
*  So they're not scaling this back. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=806.0s)]
*  No, just say like it's not also reassuring that the person who was a champion of family separation is describing this as humane. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=807.0s)]
*  A former acting director of ICE under Obama just noted that there aren't a million, quote, unquote, criminals to get. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=814.0s)]
*  If you're starting to talk about those numbers, you're talking about separating families. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=821.0s)]
*  There are 4.5 million mixed status households. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=826.0s)]
*  These are people that will be swept up in it. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=829.0s)]
*  I do like they are there. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=832.0s)]
*  You know, Donald Trump has said every single version of what this could look like. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=834.0s)]
*  Right. He's described it as targeting the worst. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=839.0s)]
*  He's describing as getting all undocumented people in the country out. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=841.0s)]
*  And my my fear about how this unfolds is they start with more targeted approaches. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=845.0s)]
*  They try to excite a liberal backlash that they can paint as being a bunch of out of touch progressives trying to defend the worst criminals. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=851.0s)]
*  They kind of inure the public to slowly rising numbers of mass deportations until we are seeing far more people being removed from the country. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=859.0s)]
*  And it becomes almost routine. So that's that is my fear. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=868.0s)]
*  What they've said so far, what he said, what they've said. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=872.0s)]
*  He has said that he told 60 Minutes This in an interview before the election that they don't want to do family separation, that families can be deported together to avoid separation. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=876.0s)]
*  So nice. Yeah. And it wants to go into sanctuary cities, go after sanctuary cities, said that if state or local officials block them and won't offer help from the police, that he said, that's fine. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=887.0s)]
*  I will just do it alone without police help. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=899.0s)]
*  He didn't say anything about this. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=902.0s)]
*  He said no military police needed just ice. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=903.0s)]
*  He's got a lot of faith and faith in ice. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=905.0s)]
*  Obviously, he's a former ice guy. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=907.0s)]
*  He said, quote to CBS, it's not going to be a mass sweep of neighborhoods. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=909.0s)]
*  It's not going to be building concentration camps. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=913.0s)]
*  I read it all. It's ridiculous. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=915.0s)]
*  And then, of course, he said he classifies the worst of the worst as people on the terrorist watch list. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=917.0s)]
*  Criminal threats get prioritized. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=923.0s)]
*  By the way, the idea that the Biden administration is allowing undocumented immigrants who've committed violent crimes to just run free by choice and not because they haven't been able to be found by law enforcement is insane. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=925.0s)]
*  But anyway, so that's what he says. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=938.0s)]
*  And then, you know, in Project 2025, they specifically cite the first round of undocumented immigrants they want to go after are people who committed felonies, crimes of violence, DUIs, and previous removal. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=940.0s)]
*  So if you have been removed once before, obviously then remain in man. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=951.0s)]
*  Obviously then remain in Mexico will come back, which is Trump's policy of if you are going to come here and ask for asylum instead of coming over the border and being detained here or allowed to stay here, you have to stay in Mexico. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=954.0s)]
*  Biden rescinded that. So they'll bring that back. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=969.0s)]
*  What's still unknown, and this is the big, the big stuff here. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=972.0s)]
*  What happens with TPS status? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=976.0s)]
*  Vance and Trump both said they were going to rescind TPS status. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=979.0s)]
*  That's what a lot of the Haitian migrants have in Ohio and Springfield, but also a lot of other places. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=982.0s)]
*  They have said in the campaign they would rescind TPS, but we don't. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=990.0s)]
*  Just to clarify what TPS is. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=993.0s)]
*  TPS is temporary protected status, which is something that's given to a group of people that are coming here from a country that is so dangerous you cannot return them to that country. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=995.0s)]
*  So like Haiti, ever since the assassination of the president was in 2021, has descended into war zone like levels of violence. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1003.0s)]
*  And the idea of just plucking people out of Ohio and sending them on planes back to Haiti and acting like they're going to be okay there is ludicrous. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1012.0s)]
*  And these people are, you know, they're legal again. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1020.0s)]
*  And Trump and Vance and the rest of them say they're not legal because they think that the action of giving them temporary protected status was illegal, is what they're saying, which is insane. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1022.0s)]
*  Also unknown what happens with the Dreamers, undocumented children of immigrants. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1032.0s)]
*  Also just the working, law-abiding, undocumented immigrants who've been here for years, decades. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1037.0s)]
*  We don't know what's going to happen with that. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1044.0s)]
*  People served in the military. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1046.0s)]
*  Yeah. So those are all big question marks. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1047.0s)]
*  They, of course, haven't said anything about them yet, but we will see. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1049.0s)]
*  But just like that CBS interview is such bullshit. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1052.0s)]
*  The idea that this process is going to be neat and tidy and families are going to go together as a package and people aren't going to do everything they can to protect their kids, to hide them, to give themselves up, to protect their families. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1055.0s)]
*  Like, give me a fucking break. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1065.0s)]
*  This is going to be family separation everywhere. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1066.0s)]
*  Right. It's sort of a, well, if you don't want us to separate your family, your child who speaks English, has never been to Mexico, can leave with you and start a new life from scratch in a country that your child does not know. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1068.0s)]
*  Or you can leave your children behind and your spouse potentially. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1080.0s)]
*  Look, I think this is where really good reporting is going to come into play here because, like you said, if they start deporting and making a big show of deporting people who have committed violent crimes here, then the liberal backlash will only help them. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1085.0s)]
*  But what we're going to have to really watch for is them making a big show of that, but then quietly deporting children and other people who any other Democratic administration or even normal Republican administration would provide a path to citizenship for. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1103.0s)]
*  Trump rescinded the family separation order under backlash and scrutiny and negative press. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1119.0s)]
*  And just, I know sometimes we act as though gravity doesn't apply to him. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1126.0s)]
*  He didn't like how it looked on TV. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1130.0s)]
*  Right. Today's presenting sponsor is Simply Safe Home Security. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1132.0s)]

*  He could turn it on and off from his phone. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1160.0s)]
*  He knows that Pundit will sleep easy every night. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1162.0s)]

*  That's too late. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1173.0s)]
*  Simply Safe's active guard outdoor protection changes the game by preventing crime before it even happens. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1174.0s)]

*  Trump announced over the weekend that he will not be inviting either Nikki Haley or Mike Pompeo to join his administration. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1281.0s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1286.0s)]
*  I guess because he enjoys publicly humiliating people who ran against him or thought about running against him in Pompeo's case. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1287.0s)]
*  He will instead be nominating the sycophantic moderate turned MAGA Congresswoman Elise Stefanik to be UN ambassador. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1294.0s)]
*  The New York Republican is currently the House Conference Chair. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1301.0s)]
*  That's number three in the House. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1303.0s)]
*  And her departure would narrow the House majority even further and trigger a special election. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1305.0s)]
*  Tommy, what do we know about her foreign policy views? [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1310.0s)]
*  And what is this signal, if anything, about Trump's foreign policy writ large? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1312.0s)]
*  I don't know that we know that much about her foreign policy views. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1316.0s)]
*  I mean, there's part of me that thinks that Trump naming Elise Stefanik to the UN might be the first and last time he ever says her name. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1318.0s)]
*  You know, just forgets that she exists. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1324.0s)]
*  In reality, she will probably use the perch to do a bunch of high profile things to defend Israel in various ways and like reaffirm her bona fides there. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1326.0s)]
*  Like she did the hearings with the college presidents about anti-Semitism. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1336.0s)]
*  What this signals to me about foreign policy, I think, is important. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1340.0s)]
*  Like the Nikki Haley thing didn't surprise me. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1343.0s)]
*  She ran against him. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1345.0s)]
*  She stayed in a long time. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1346.0s)]
*  She didn't kiss the ring. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1347.0s)]
*  And he knows he can't trust her. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1348.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1349.0s)]
*  Totally right. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1350.0s)]
*  He doesn't trust her. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1351.0s)]
*  He's not trustworthy. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1352.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1353.0s)]
*  Pompeo, though, was like he's a MAGA loyalist. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1354.0s)]
*  And I think it's an important signal about the direction they're going. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1355.0s)]
*  And I reached out to someone who's a very close Trump watcher to say, like, what do you think this means? [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1358.0s)]
*  And this person said, this means that Don Jr. and J.D. Vance are in charge of personnel right now. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1362.0s)]
*  And the Pompeo in particular to me felt like those guys taking like a neocon establishment head, cutting it off and sticking it on a pike for all others to see as they think about applying to jobs in the administration. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1368.0s)]
*  And it is suggested this time around, though, the national security team will not be retired four star generals and Jim Mattis and like squishy business guys like Rex Tillerson. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1382.0s)]
*  It is going to be America first ideologues. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1392.0s)]
*  And all those people are going to be like, no, that's just don't even come near here. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1396.0s)]
*  That's yeah. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1400.0s)]
*  Like last time, my general's he was America first on the streets, establishment cuck in the sheets. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1402.0s)]
*  I mean, so it doesn't go well for Ukraine. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1409.0s)]
*  It suggests Trump will pull U.S. troops out of Syria, Somalia. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1411.0s)]
*  If I lived in Taiwan or South Korea, I would be nervous. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1415.0s)]
*  And look, not all of this is bad. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1418.0s)]
*  I mean, I think there is popular support for some parts of this agenda. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1421.0s)]
*  There's clearly some of the like, you know, war on terror, U.S. military establishment, you know, infrastructure that should be sunsetted at some point. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1425.0s)]
*  But I think also silver lining that John Bolton is not going to be an administration silver lining that ultra hawks like Tom Cotton are not even applying for jobs. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1434.0s)]
*  But I viewed it as a big signal. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1443.0s)]
*  I was sort of surprised that Marco Rubio keeps getting floated for a potential national security job because I'm like he I know he is now extremely Trumpy, but he's still a neocon enough that I feel like he does not quite fit with the with the America first. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1446.0s)]
*  Yeah, but he's been brought to heel. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1460.0s)]
*  I mean, Elise Stefanik would, I think, had she been around longer before she made her turn, been a Marco Rubio type, at least by instinct. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1462.0s)]
*  But they've shown themselves to be quite. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1468.0s)]
*  Client. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1471.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, just on the UN piece like the UN relies on the US for about a third of its budget. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1472.0s)]
*  There's all these component parts to it that matter a lot to people like us. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1477.0s)]
*  We do half the funding for the World Food Program. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1480.0s)]
*  You know, they'll probably pull out of the Paris Climate Accords. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1483.0s)]
*  UNRWA, which does all the humanitarian relief in Gaza and surrounding areas for Palestinians, will probably get gutted again. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1486.0s)]
*  I'm guessing RFK Junior is not a big fan of the World Health Organization, which is a part of the UN. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1493.0s)]
*  So it could be a lot of changes. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1498.0s)]
*  You know, Elise Stefanik vacating that seat, and she won the district by quite a bit. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1500.0s)]
*  But I don't know. It's 80 days by New York state law to schedule a special election after she officially vacates the seat. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1505.0s)]
*  You start off your first hundred days of the administration with one less seat and an already very thin House majority. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1513.0s)]
*  Also, that's before any other potential Republican House members get an administration job. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1520.0s)]
*  We're about to talk about Lee Zeldin. It's a little dicey. It's getting close in the House majority there. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1525.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. I can see why she wants the job, though. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1529.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1532.0s)]
*  It's just sort of like being in opposition is fun. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1533.0s)]
*  She loved being in opposition to Democrats. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1535.0s)]
*  Now she gets to be in opposition to the UN and all that it represents to the right. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1537.0s)]
*  It was also funny to think, too, like that was Nikki Haley's job. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1541.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1545.0s)]
*  And now we've shifted from him putting in place kind of more establishment type Republicans to someone who is completely oiled in. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1546.0s)]
*  So Trump just announced he's nominating another New Yorker who was in Congress, former Congressman Lee Zeldin, to be the EPA administrator. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1553.0s)]
*  A lot of New Yorkers get in the nod. Tom Homan also from New York. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1559.0s)]
*  He's going to be the EPA administrator. His lifetime score from the League of Conservation of Voters is a whopping 14 percent. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1562.0s)]
*  14 percent better than a lot of Republicans. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1568.0s)]
*  What do we know about Zeldin aside from the fact that he's a Trump loyalist and lost the governor's race to Kathy Hogle? [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1571.0s)]
*  I don't really know that we need to know much. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1576.0s)]
*  He's expressed some climate skepticism, though he did join a climate solutions caucus. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1578.0s)]
*  It's interesting that we're going with Lee Zeldin, who's not like doesn't have a big record on environmental issues. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1583.0s)]
*  The previous head, he's a lawyer, previous head of the EPA was a coal lobbyist. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1589.0s)]
*  That was who was there the first term. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1593.0s)]
*  But I think we can just expect there's also somebody who voted against certifying the elections, a Trumpy guy. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1595.0s)]
*  And don't worry, coal enthusiasts, you'll still have you'll be fine. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1600.0s)]
*  But I think he is being sent there to gut climate and clean energy regulations with gusto. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1604.0s)]
*  And that is what he will do. Right. That is the plan. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1611.0s)]
*  Again, what the people asked for in the election. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1614.0s)]
*  One last top government job to cover. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1617.0s)]
*  Trump and Fed chair Jerome Powell famously do not get along. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1619.0s)]
*  After appointing Powell in 2017, Trump reportedly spent the rest of his administration second guessing the decision. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1623.0s)]
*  That's new. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1628.0s)]
*  And in 2018, per The Wall Street Journal, Powell even considered footing his own legal bills to hold onto the job if Trump fired him. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1629.0s)]
*  Now the question is whether Trump is still flirting with firing Powell, whose term ends in 2026. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1635.0s)]
*  As some of Trump supporters want him to. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1642.0s)]
*  Powell has a different idea. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1644.0s)]
*  Here he is at a news conference last Thursday. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1646.0s)]
*  Some of the president's elect's advisors have suggested that you should resign. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1648.0s)]
*  If he asked you to leave, would you go? [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1653.0s)]
*  No. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1656.0s)]
*  Can you follow up on, do you think that legally you're not required to leave? [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1657.0s)]
*  No. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1663.0s)]
*  Do you believe the president has the power to fire or demote you and has the Fed determine the legality of a president demoting at will any of the other governors with leadership positions? [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1664.0s)]
*  Not permitted under the law. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1674.0s)]
*  Not what? [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1676.0s)]
*  Not permitted under the law. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1677.0s)]
*  I love that that's it. That's all they gave. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1679.0s)]
*  No, no, not permitted under the law. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1682.0s)]
*  What do you guys think Trump will do here? [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1684.0s)]
*  What can he do? [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1686.0s)]
*  Republicans believe that Democrats can't fire anyone and Republicans can fire whoever they want. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1688.0s)]
*  They believe that federal power rests solely in the executive and that if Congress has tried to limit that, that that's an unconstitutional use of their power. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1695.0s)]
*  So I'm sure they would want to take this all the way to the Supreme Court if they could. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1704.0s)]
*  The question is does he want that fight? I have no idea. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1706.0s)]
*  I love a scrappy nerd. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1708.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1710.0s)]
*  You know? Battle back. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1711.0s)]
*  I feel like there's three options. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1712.0s)]
*  Trump says I'm firing you for cause. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1713.0s)]
*  They battle it out in a conservative court. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1715.0s)]
*  Trump probably wins that. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1717.0s)]
*  Second, he could ask supporters in Congress to put forward legislation, putting the Fed fully under his control. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1718.0s)]
*  I think Mike Lee, Republican senator, has put forward such a proposal in the past. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1726.0s)]
*  Or the like super authoritarian version is have some Treasury staffers go down to his office, pack up his shit, put it on the sidewalk and be like, you're gone. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1730.0s)]
*  I think that my guess on this one is that Trump doesn't do well. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1740.0s)]
*  So a senior adviser told CNN he's likely to let Powell stay. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1743.0s)]
*  But it's Trump world. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1747.0s)]
*  So who knows what the senior advisers take them out there, take it with a grain of salt. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1748.0s)]
*  I think that the Supreme Court has ruled before that if Congress has created the agency that's independent, the president doesn't have the authority to do this. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1753.0s)]
*  But we'll see. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1762.0s)]
*  And I think that Trump probably doesn't want the fight. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1763.0s)]
*  Although, you know, just wait until people are pissed that interest rates haven't come down fast enough, even though he's going to do another rate cut and people are still pissed about high mortgage interest rates and car loans and all that kind of stuff. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1767.0s)]
*  And then Trump gets mad. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1778.0s)]
*  And I guess then we'll see. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1779.0s)]
*  I guess my Trump like Trump. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1781.0s)]
*  That's what he did as president. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1783.0s)]
*  We've lived through this already. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1784.0s)]
*  He likes to work the reps at the Fed. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1785.0s)]
*  He wants to kind of push them and push them and push them. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1787.0s)]
*  So we'll see if that gets him what he wants or if he feels like he's done enough or if he wants to go further. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1789.0s)]
*  But I think the markets. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1793.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1794.0s)]
*  Does he want to have the right? [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1795.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1796.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1797.0s)]
*  Knowing that the fight could affect the markets and he doesn't want he doesn't want that one position that Trump's trying to exert control over is Republican Senate Majority Leader. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1798.0s)]
*  Rhino Trump hater Mitch McConnell is stepping down. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1805.0s)]
*  I'm not going to have Mitch to kick around anymore. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1808.0s)]
*  And going into the weekend, it seemed like the frontrunners to replace him were South Dakota's John Thune and Texas's John Cornyn, both of whom have served in Senate leadership for quite a while. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1810.0s)]
*  But then Trump posted over the weekend that whoever becomes leader needs to be willing to adjourn the Senate so that Trump can staff his cabinet and administration without Senate confirmation, a maneuver known as recess appointments. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1820.0s)]
*  Thune and Cornyn kind of sort of agreed, but not as enthusiastically as Florida Senator Rick Scott, who had been a dark horse candidate until Magoworld decided that he's their favorite. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1831.0s)]
*  And the other two are now rhinos. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1841.0s)]
*  Scott has now gotten endorsements from Elon Musk, Tucker Carlson, R.F.K. Junior, Charlie Kirk, Vivek, the whole gang, the whole gang. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1844.0s)]
*  Benny Johnson even posted a whip count to pressure Republican senators. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1852.0s)]
*  So far, Scott has actual Senate endorsements from five senators, including Marco Rubio. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1856.0s)]
*  Playbook reported this morning that the outside pressure to elect Scott is creating a backlash among Senate Republicans who will be voting for this position via secret ballot. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1861.0s)]
*  But what do you guys think? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1870.0s)]
*  Does that does the secret ballot save the people who don't want Scott? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1872.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1877.0s)]
*  I mean, we're talking about 100 people. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1878.0s)]
*  That's what I think. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1880.0s)]
*  About 53 people. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1881.0s)]
*  Yeah, right. Sorry. Right. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1882.0s)]
*  That'd be the 100 senators. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1883.0s)]
*  I mean, this is not going to be that hard. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1884.0s)]
*  Like journalists do whip counts. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1885.0s)]
*  They're going to ask, who did you vote for? [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1887.0s)]
*  The political side. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1888.0s)]
*  That's what's going to happen. They're going to haul them on TV. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1889.0s)]
*  You go to a friend, Sean Hannity, you tell us who you voted for. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1892.0s)]
*  Yeah. So I don't know. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1895.0s)]
*  And I don't have any faith in these guys finding a spine because, you know, again, Trump can find someone who's up in 2026, float a primary challenge to them. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1897.0s)]
*  They freak out and move on. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1904.0s)]
*  One of the one of the Rhino cucks that that the mag world went after for his support of John Thune, Josh Hawley. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1906.0s)]
*  It's getting shit. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1913.0s)]
*  This is all I really like. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1914.0s)]
*  It's all just sort of like they've decided Rick Scott is better versus these other two. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1915.0s)]
*  Part of me at some point thinks like Trump is going to have to brush back the Elon Tucker public kind of wrangling to make clear the decisions are coming from him. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1921.0s)]
*  I bet it's coming from Don Jr. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1931.0s)]
*  To those guys. Do you think Elon Musk has talked about this a second? [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1933.0s)]
*  Do you think Elon Musk has ever thought about recess appointments before he tweeted about the other day? [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1936.0s)]
*  I'm guessing zero. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1939.0s)]
*  So being fed this for sure. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1940.0s)]
*  It feels coordinated. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1942.0s)]
*  I mean, also, we should talk one second about what a failure Mitch McConnell is because he was like he didn't vote to impeach. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1943.0s)]
*  He turtled at every Trump demand because he said he wanted to protect the institution of the Senate and protect the party. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1949.0s)]
*  Well, now your power is getting gutted, buddy. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1955.0s)]
*  Great job. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1957.0s)]
*  Your boss is going to be Rick Scott. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1958.0s)]
*  Maybe because we did a fair amount of of blaming Joe Biden. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1960.0s)]
*  And I'm glad we did that. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1965.0s)]
*  But Mitch McConnell deciding he's not he is the reason we're here because if Nikki Haley had been the candidate or one of these other Republicans have been the candidate, I'm not sure they would have done worse. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1966.0s)]
*  I think they were probably would have done a lot better and then we wouldn't be dealing with Donald Trump's bullshit and and chaos for four years. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1976.0s)]
*  That is on Mitch McConnell. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1982.0s)]
*  Practical difference between Majority Leader Thune or Cornyn and Majority Leader Scott. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1983.0s)]
*  I mean, I think it's like I think with Scott, it's just well, first of all, Scott's an idiot. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1988.0s)]
*  There's zero daylight between Rick Scott and Donald Trump. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1993.0s)]
*  And I don't think there'd be much daylight between John Thune and or John Cornyn and Donald Trump. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=1996.0s)]
*  But again, when we're talking like if we're talking really crazy shit from Donald Trump, like at the extremes, like you could imagine the Thune or Cornyn not wanting to default on the debt. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2000.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2011.0s)]
*  This goes back to what I mean. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2013.0s)]
*  There's one one point I just wanted to make, too, because this is why the the KCC matters. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2014.0s)]
*  But if Casey doesn't eke it out, you can't imagine votes where they let Attila Collins and Murkowski go and bring JD Vanson to break the tie. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2019.0s)]
*  Right. Right. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2028.0s)]
*  And it really is about what the Senate majority is willing to do with his majority. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2029.0s)]
*  Right. And I do think Rick Scott is for that reason, I think, a little bit more sleazy than the other two, which is probably what Tucker and the rest of them have figured out as well. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2034.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, look, I think it's the difference between having a leader in the Senate who has respect for the institution and respect for himself and one who does not. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2045.0s)]
*  And there are probably some very fringe, unqualified people that could get through a Rick Scott led Senate, but not a John Thune led Senate. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2054.0s)]
*  Like a lot of even mega types think Laura Loomer is toxic. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2063.0s)]
*  You know, remember, she was on the plane with Trump at the end, apparently, according to Tim Obert as reporting, there were lots of even mega people that were like, hey, get her off. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2067.0s)]
*  She's toxic. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2074.0s)]
*  Rick Scott recently went on her podcast and defended her. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2075.0s)]
*  So, you know, the maybe some bright side for Democrats is Rick Scott as a repellent figure. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2078.0s)]
*  He has proven himself to be very bad at politics. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2085.0s)]
*  And at a time when there is this big populist surge, this is a dude who ran a company that defrauded Medicare. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2088.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, he's like the he's like the richest member of the Senate or one of the richest find one point seven billion dollars at the time. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2096.0s)]
*  He also put forward that plan to got Medicare and Social Security that became a huge liability that all these Republicans had to run away from. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2103.0s)]
*  Yes, I realize that Trump is the billionaire rich guy who who doesn't do as in code as a as a billionaire. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2112.0s)]
*  But we've got Elon, Rick Scott. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2119.0s)]
*  It's getting really obvious. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2122.0s)]
*  A lot of oligarchs up there. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2124.0s)]
*  I do think, you know, I'm looking forward to hopefully all of these people eventually knifing each other. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2127.0s)]
*  The Elans, the Trumps, the Don Juniors, Rick Scott's the like it can't the you know, you can't the honeymoon can't last forever. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2132.0s)]
*  You know, get Elon jumping on calls with Zelensky and what's happening. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2141.0s)]
*  Christ. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2145.0s)]
*  Well, he did such good work at Twitter. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2147.0s)]
*  Let's talk about the recess appointment thing because that's because maybe it doesn't matter who is the majority leader in the Senate because Trump gets everyone confirmed without the Senate. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2149.0s)]
*  Anyone want to briefly explain what a recess appointment is and whether Trump can actually staff his cabinet and confirm judges without the Senate. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2158.0s)]
*  So Reese's appointment, the Constitution allows the president to fill vacancies when the Senate is in recess. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2166.0s)]
*  What does it mean for the Senate to be in recess? [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2173.0s)]
*  That has been something that's been been litigated and controversial. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2175.0s)]
*  The Obama administration tried to use recess appointments when the Senate was adjourned, but they had technically not been in recess. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2178.0s)]
*  The Republicans were trying to stop the Obama administration from filling vacancies. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2186.0s)]
*  The court ruled against the Obama administration in that fight. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2189.0s)]
*  But basically, it boils down to this is what you've seen. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2194.0s)]
*  What we're talking about is basically what happens if Democrats don't allow the Senate to adjourn, keep it in a kind of pro forma session because they don't have the they don't have enough to break a filibuster to get the Senate out. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2198.0s)]
*  What will Donald Trump do and what will Senate Republicans do? [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2213.0s)]
*  And the question is, will Senate Republicans use kind of procedural maneuvers to get around this rule to allow Trump to fill cabinet vacancies, fill lower office vacancies and potentially even fill judicial vacancies up to and including the Supreme Court? [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2215.0s)]
*  Steve Lattick, who is a legal expert, been on strict scrutiny a bunch. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2230.0s)]
*  He thinks that the motion to adjourn is not subject to filibuster and that you don't need that. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2235.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter what the Democrats want because all you need is a simple majority. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2242.0s)]
*  You need the Senate majority leader, who in this case would be Thune, Scott or or Cornyn, to just say we're in recess, adjourn the Senate, and then Trump can just confirm anyone he wants. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2245.0s)]
*  So what's interesting about that is that may be what they get to, but that's not like even Cornyn was saying if the Democrats try to keep the Senate in session, we'll make them vote, we'll make them stay. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2256.0s)]
*  That's because he's a rhino cuck. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2266.0s)]
*  Well, I just like, yeah, like maybe let's keep Vladek's fucking peace away from Cornyn. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2267.0s)]
*  But the filling judicial vacancies thing is scary because there's even the Vladek was talking about how long those appointments would last. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2272.0s)]
*  And even if those are appointments that just last until the end of the next congressional session. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2283.0s)]
*  Because that's what they're supposed to do. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2288.0s)]
*  If you do a judge, you know, it's not the judge gets a lifetime appointment through recess appointments. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2290.0s)]
*  It would they would have to eventually be confirmed once the Senate adjourns, which would be in the end of the next session. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2294.0s)]
*  Or recess appointed again. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2300.0s)]
*  Or recess appointed again. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2301.0s)]
*  Right, if Donald Trump just keeps winning. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2302.0s)]
*  Right. So that would just be the ability of Donald Trump to put anyone on the court without any check whatsoever. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2304.0s)]
*  And it's as long as the Republicans in power, basically. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2309.0s)]
*  Once a Democratic Senate or a Democratic president came to power, all those judges would then have to be convicted. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2312.0s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2318.0s)]
*  For the next two years. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2319.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2320.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2321.0s)]
*  I think the thing you need to know is recess appointments made sense when the Senate was first formed and the Senate was not in session for months at a time. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2322.0s)]
*  And people are riding to Washington on horseback. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2328.0s)]
*  Right. So the president needed to be able to fill slots that the authority has been narrowed over time, as Lovett noted. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2330.0s)]
*  But I think in practice, what this means is these all the people running for Senate Majority Leader, all these Republicans are just handing over a giant part of their job. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2336.0s)]
*  They're just taking the knee bending the knee to Donald Trump on day one, saying our advising consent authority to vote on your nominees and vet them and hold hearings. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2346.0s)]
*  We'll happily give it up if you'll be nice to us. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2356.0s)]
*  Yeah. And you know what? [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2358.0s)]
*  I'll say this is in terms of public outrage or whatever. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2359.0s)]
*  I think it is a smart thing for them to do because I do not think and this is why we are big on getting rid of the filibuster, because it's one that I do not think the public will care about or they'll be backlash to. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2364.0s)]
*  People don't usually give a shit about process stuff. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2375.0s)]
*  And so a bunch of people screaming, they're like, oh, the Senate has been adjourned. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2377.0s)]
*  What are we going to do now? [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2380.0s)]
*  It depends on who he nominates. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2382.0s)]
*  The scary thing here is the idea that Trump has a 53 or 52 seat Senate majority and still needs to do all these recess appointments like he should be able to confirm a lot of these folks with just a majority vote unless he wants, you know, Mike Flynn to come back at some of the real fucking kooks. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2384.0s)]
*  So I yeah. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2403.0s)]
*  So then the question is, right? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2404.0s)]
*  Like these guys are bending over backwards because they want this job. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2405.0s)]
*  They are leaving themselves outs when they like at least Thune and Cornyn did when they. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2408.0s)]
*  Yeah, but they are. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2412.0s)]
*  When they when they talked about this to basically say how fast they want to move into late at the feet of Democrats, they want to blame Democrats. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2413.0s)]
*  I think there will be some nominees that Republicans genuinely would like to stop. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2419.0s)]
*  And then there are some of them nominees that Republicans don't particularly like, but are more worried about the politics for themselves and would happily allow them to be a recess appointment. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2424.0s)]
*  Not vote. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2432.0s)]
*  That said, we went this we went through this before. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2433.0s)]
*  And also Donald Trump can also do a lot of acting positions. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2435.0s)]
*  Right. Right. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2438.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2439.0s)]
*  So a lot of options. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2440.0s)]
*  So I like I am worried about it, too, because I don't it's not very it's very disheartening to see these guys immediately just say like, no, no, no, the Senate doesn't exist anymore. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2441.0s)]
*  You know, you can govern by fiat. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2449.0s)]
*  We're fine. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2450.0s)]
*  But at the same time, he has a lot of ways to get around this without ever having to get to recess appointments. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2451.0s)]
*  And I assume that's what they'll want to do. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2456.0s)]
*  They'll want to have the most cases. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2457.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2458.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's just instructive. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2459.0s)]
*  I think that like our one is just filled with these power grabs. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2460.0s)]
*  Oh, I'm taking the Fed, taking recess appointments. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2464.0s)]
*  I want all these things. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2466.0s)]
*  I mean, it sort of confirms a lot of the worst authoritarian concerns about him. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2467.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2470.0s)]
*  Trump also truth that he doesn't want Republicans to approve Biden judicial nominees in a lame duck session before Democrats lose power. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2471.0s)]
*  Like, OK, there was no danger of that anyway. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2477.0s)]
*  But he can't control that. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2480.0s)]
*  No. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2482.0s)]
*  I mean, the only the only thing he can do right is this. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2483.0s)]
*  I saw some questions like, will Republicans be absent during this time? [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2486.0s)]
*  And that will allow Democrats to get to some votes quicker. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2490.0s)]
*  And then there's Joe Manchin, who said he will not confirm anybody that doesn't have Republican support. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2493.0s)]
*  So this was so this would prevent basically there might be some judges that could have garnered some kind of Republican support. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2498.0s)]
*  Donald Trump saying this makes that nearly impossible. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2503.0s)]
*  So then it really comes down to what Kirsten Sinema is willing to do. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2505.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2508.0s)]
*  I was couple of weeks. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2509.0s)]
*  But I also think with Manchin, too, if there's been a bunch of judges in the pipeline that have gotten a vote and, you know, all of a lot of them probably may have gotten support from their home state Republican senator. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2510.0s)]
*  I bet I would bet Manchin counts that as part of the support, even if they renege on it. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2519.0s)]
*  But that's just Trump saying, you know, his bullshit stuff. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2525.0s)]
*  One other big topic before we get to Congressman Pat Ryan, whether Trump will make good on his threats to use the federal government to investigate, prosecute or audit his enemies. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2528.0s)]
*  Peter Nicholas at NBC News had a lengthy story about this. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2537.0s)]
*  Today, there was some justifiable hand wringing of folks like former Trump National Security official Olivia Troy, who appeared in ads against him. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2541.0s)]
*  She said she's pretty nervous, worried about threats to her or her family. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2552.0s)]
*  Trump, of course, talked a lot about using the military on the enemy within in the latter stages of the campaign and identified Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi as being on that list, whatever that means. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2556.0s)]
*  Trump, of course, has also said that success would be his revenge. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2566.0s)]
*  On the other hand, J.D. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2570.0s)]
*  Vance seemed to say on Joe Rogan that they'd be revoking the security clearances of the national security people who signed a letter in 2020 questioning some of the Hunter Biden laptop stuff that might not sound like a huge deal, but it would mean a lot of people potentially losing their jobs. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2572.0s)]
*  The NBC story also quoted Mark Zaid, a prominent DC lawyer who represented one of Trump's impeachment witnesses and various other anti-Trump whistleblowers as saying he's advising certain clients to leave the country until it's clear what the new administration is going to do. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2587.0s)]
*  First of all, just for the sake of everyone's blood pressure, what do we think counts as an enemy? Who do we think counts as an enemy here? [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2603.0s)]
*  Seems like people who turned on him, who he views as directly responsible for something around the 2020 election. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2610.0s)]
*  I mean, I think if I were Michael Cohen, this former lawyer, I'd be pretty worried about lawfare. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2618.0s)]
*  But, you know, there's a more expansive list, depending on who's in charge of, you know, which personnel gets picked. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2625.0s)]
*  This guy, Cash Patel, who was sort of a hardcore MAGA sycophant, he has said on a podcast with Steve Bannon, quote, [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2630.0s)]
*  We are going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2640.0s)]
*  We're coming. We're going to come after you, whether it's criminally or civilly. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2646.0s)]
*  We'll figure that out. But yeah, we're putting you all on notice. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2649.0s)]
*  Cash Patel, someone has been floated for CIA director, FBI director, top national security jobs. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2652.0s)]
*  Mike Flynn, former national security advisor, tweeted a threat at Barack Obama. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2658.0s)]
*  Yeah, Trump is threatened retaliation against Michelle Obama. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2663.0s)]
*  So we don't know. It's the honest answer. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2667.0s)]
*  Yeah, I just want to take a second. One week ago, we recorded our pod before the election about how hopeful we were. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2670.0s)]
*  And it's one week later and we are trying to figure out who exactly constitutes an enemy. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2676.0s)]
*  And that is terrifying. And is and and so like, I don't know that we can take the blood pressure down just yet. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2681.0s)]
*  And I don't know that we should. Like what what strikes me from what they've been saying is basically going after people's clearances is something they can do pretty easily. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2687.0s)]
*  And I think one thing we have learned over the years is when you start going after somebody's clearances, it's true of Donald Trump, also true of Hillary Clinton, also true of Joe Biden. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2696.0s)]
*  You find lapses, you find mistakes, you go through what Olivia Troy has said in every media appearance for a year, you know, that they can drum up something to claim she violated some security clearance and revealed some classified information. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2704.0s)]
*  And so I do think that like that alone is pretty terrifying, right? [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2716.0s)]
*  Because there's I don't know how many hundreds of thousands, millions of people that have cleared too many people have clearances as Tommy's talked about. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2720.0s)]
*  And that like the chilling effect of this, all these people whose either their jobs depend on having a clearance because they're inside the government or outside of the government or they're outside of government now and commentating and afraid of what happens if they speak honestly about Donald Trump for fear that they'll be targeted for abusing their clearance. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2727.0s)]
*  I think that that is just that before you get to some of the more outlandish and and and wild accusations is is pretty scary. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2743.0s)]
*  There's also a version of this where it's like Trump at his events started making a part of his stump speech, this litany of complaints about Nancy Pelosi and stock trades. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2751.0s)]
*  So you could imagine him directing DOJ or the SEC to investigate her for insider trading. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2761.0s)]
*  But there's a softer version that's similar to what you're saying, love it, which is like, you just put out word to all the big law firms in town that anyone who worked for Jack Smith or for the Biden DOJ, you shouldn't hire them if you want any business before us, stuff like that. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2766.0s)]
*  So like there's a less authoritarian version that's just sort of intimidation. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2780.0s)]
*  Yeah, which is still pretty authoritarian. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2783.0s)]
*  But I know you're saying not look over it because I do think let's stop mean. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2785.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2788.0s)]
*  All this could happen. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2789.0s)]
*  Let's talk about like the politics for the Trump administration, right? [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2790.0s)]
*  Because let's pretend that it let's let's just stipulate that Trump doesn't have a change of heart and decides to lay off everyone because he's you know, he's seen God now that he's almost been assassinated twice. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2793.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2802.0s)]
*  But there are political considerations too for doing this. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2804.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2806.0s)]
*  And if you were the Trump administration, you would probably want to not generate too much sound and furor by going after too many people or too many high profile people at once. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2807.0s)]
*  Like I'm just trying to think of various guard wheels that could if we look back and be like, oh, he didn't end up doing all this stuff. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2820.0s)]
*  Why not? [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2825.0s)]
*  I think it would be because you don't want to backlash from going after high profile people like the Obamas, the Bidens, people, stuff like that. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2826.0s)]
*  Or, you know, it's there's a bunch of people in the Justice Department that are still career officials and that they don't get rid of the whole Justice Department and they don't want to do this. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2834.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2845.0s)]
*  What do you guys think? [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2846.0s)]
*  You're you're just describing the people that have already tried to hold Donald Trump accountable for his malfeasance in the past. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2847.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is running an ongoing criminal operation. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2854.0s)]
*  This can be the most corrupt administration in history. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2857.0s)]
*  And so already, just by having this gun on the mantle of threatening people and threatening enemies, even if he doesn't act on it, even if he waits, he is already going to prevent the whistleblowers that came forward in the past. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2860.0s)]
*  They may be much more reluctant to do it this time because think about the people that spoke out against Donald Trump. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2873.0s)]
*  A great personal risk testified before Congress, testified at impeachment inquiries only to watch him be acquitted and then elected president again. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2879.0s)]
*  We let those people down specifically. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2889.0s)]
*  And I don't know who is going to stick their neck out. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2891.0s)]
*  This is changing. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2893.0s)]
*  Everyone's ready to toss her over the side because Kamala dared to campaign with her once. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2894.0s)]
*  Right. Right. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2898.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2899.0s)]
*  You know, it's fucking I mean, look, no, I totally agree. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2900.0s)]
*  I totally agree. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2903.0s)]
*  And it's very like, look, the whole this is all operating within the realm of like it's bad. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2904.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2910.0s)]
*  Like it could be it could be it's it's like, is it going to be bad? [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2911.0s)]
*  Is it going to be worse? [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2913.0s)]
*  Is it going to be the worse? [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2914.0s)]
*  What do you guys think about potential political backlash? [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2915.0s)]
*  Do you think it wouldn't generate that much? [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2918.0s)]
*  Do you think that's not who it is? [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2920.0s)]
*  I think it's a person people haven't heard of. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2922.0s)]
*  It's a one day story. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2924.0s)]
*  And then that person deals with legal bills and scary meetings with FBI people and no one gives a fuck. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2925.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I worry about. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2931.0s)]
*  Yeah, I just you know, we did round after round after round. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2932.0s)]
*  It's just very cynical. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2936.0s)]
*  But like we did these rounds of stories like we did this already. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2937.0s)]
*  We did this already. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2941.0s)]
*  Trump going after his enemies or his enemies going after it. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2942.0s)]
*  Right. You know, whistleblowers going after Trump. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2944.0s)]
*  And it generates tons of headlines, generates tons of attention, generates hearings, and even generates generated to impeachments. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2946.0s)]
*  But ultimately, I think millions upon millions of people dismiss it as noise. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2954.0s)]
*  Right. He is a he is a convicted felon. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2958.0s)]
*  Invicted felon who's about to be president again. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2960.0s)]
*  All right. When we come back from the break, you'll hear Tommy's conversation with Congressman Pat Ryan about how he pulled off a 13 point win in a heavily targeted swing district. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2962.0s)]
*  But before we do that, in case you missed it, the host of Strict Scrutiny have a new episode breaking down what last week's election means for the future of the Supreme Court and state courts. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2971.0s)]
*  We all love strict because it helps us make sense of how the legal system works without needing a law degree. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2979.0s)]
*  It's smart and funny, focuses on really important issues without feeling like homework. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2983.0s)]
*  So subscribe to Strict Scrutiny wherever you get your podcasts and on YouTube. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2987.0s)]
*  When we come back, Pat Ryan. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2991.0s)]
*  Pots of America is brought to you by Zbiotics pre-alcohol. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2994.0s)]
*  Let's face it, after a night with drinks, you probably don't bounce back the next day like you used to. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=2997.0s)]
*  I sure as hell don't. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3002.0s)]
*  Zbiotics pre-alcohol probiotic drink is the world's first genetically engineered probiotic. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3003.0s)]
*  It was invented by PhD scientists to tackle rough mornings after drinking. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3008.0s)]
*  Here's how it works. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3012.0s)]
*  When you drink, alcohol gets converted into a toxic byproduct in the gut. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3013.0s)]
*  It's this byproduct, not dehydration, that's to blame for your rough next day. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3017.0s)]
*  Pre-alcohol produces an enzyme to break this byproduct down. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3021.0s)]
*  Just remember to make Zbiotics your first drink of the night. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3024.0s)]
*  Drink responsibly and feel your best tomorrow. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3027.0s)]
*  Look, I've been talking about Zbiotics on this show for years and offline in my normal life. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3030.0s)]
*  Every single friend I have now uses Zbiotics. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3036.0s)]
*  We swear by it. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3039.0s)]
*  It makes a huge difference for me. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3040.0s)]
*  And honestly, I just don't like to have even a drink without it because Zbiotics will make me feel better. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3042.0s)]
*  So give it a shot. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3048.0s)]
*  And with their GMO technology, Zbiotics is continuing to invent probiotics that will help with everyday challenges of modern living. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3049.0s)]

*  After this brutal election, we are trying to talk with as many smart people as possible about what the hell happened and how we can fix it. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3074.0s)]
*  That is why we invited Congressman Pat Ryan to the show today to discuss his experience running and winning overwhelmingly, I should say, in a swing district in New York. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3081.0s)]
*  Congressman, great to see you again. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3090.0s)]
*  Thank you guys for having me. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3091.0s)]
*  So you represent the 18th district of New York. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3092.0s)]
*  Biden won the 18th by about eight points in 2020. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3095.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris only won it by two points this cycle. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3098.0s)]
*  While you won it by about 13 points, one of the counties you represent, Orange County, swung nine points to the right at the presidential level. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3101.0s)]
*  But you won Orange County by seven points. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3108.0s)]
*  So obviously you were doing something right that the presidential level was not. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3111.0s)]
*  But just to start, can you give us a sense of the makeup of your district and who you think your voters are? [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3115.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, so we're an hour and a half to two hours straight north of New York City. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3120.0s)]
*  And it's a mix of the southern part of my district is essentially the northern suburbs of New York City. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3125.0s)]
*  You have NYPD cops, FDNY firefighters, a lot of folks that work in and out of New York City. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3131.0s)]
*  And then the further north you go, you have more ex-urban, more rural, a lot of agricultural communities and farms. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3137.0s)]
*  But we also have along the sort of tight corridor of New York City, some very affluent cities like Beacon and Rhinebeck that are highly educated and quite progressive. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3145.0s)]
*  And then we have nine universities from Bard and Fister to West Point, my alma mater. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3156.0s)]
*  So it's a, I think a good bellwether of the complexity of our great country. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3161.0s)]
*  And it's about slight democratic enrollment advantage, but a huge number of independent, not party-aligned voters. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3167.0s)]
*  That's interesting. And you wrote this really interesting thread about how you feel like you were able to win in this eclectic makeup, swingy district in this political climate. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3177.0s)]
*  It was obviously terrible for Democrats. And I do want to get to that in a second. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3187.0s)]
*  But first, I mean, I'm curious what you make of why Biden and then Harris lost so much support from 2020 to 2024, both in your district, but also across New York state. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3191.0s)]
*  Because on election day, it was less surprising to me to see Trump win a bunch of highly contested, swingy battleground states. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3201.0s)]
*  But it was very surprising to see Trump make huge gains in non-battleground states like New York and New Jersey. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3209.0s)]
*  And I'm curious what you made of that. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3216.0s)]
*  Yeah. And it's a little more complicated in New York. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3218.0s)]
*  I think there's a huge difference between like the New York City numbers and results versus actually these battleground house districts, which we can talk about that if you want. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3221.0s)]
*  But at the macro level, I think it's like there's two pieces. There's there's substance and style on the substance. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3230.0s)]
*  We just completely missed where people are. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3237.0s)]
*  Everybody, not not Democrats, Republicans, not Latinos or white, not young or old. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3243.0s)]
*  Like everybody is dealing with this essentially existential affordability crisis. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3250.0s)]
*  And if we weren't talking about that every day, I just think you weren't. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3255.0s)]
*  You know, connecting with people around their major, major pain point that they've been dealing with for many years now on the style, too, though, I think like. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3261.0s)]
*  I mean, I really prioritize you talked about our Orange County numbers, which I'm super proud of. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3270.0s)]
*  We had we had lost this county by seven or eight percent two years ago. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3275.0s)]
*  We won it by seven or eight percent. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3279.0s)]
*  And it was because we just worked the district like I prioritize going to every single community there, especially the redder, more Trumpy communities. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3281.0s)]
*  We did this mobile cares van, which my staff made fun of me for. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3291.0s)]
*  But it's like we went to all 82 of our towns over and over and over and did constituent services and did listening sessions and just really showed up and truly listened and then did everything we could to deliver and really show the fight like that. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3295.0s)]
*  We were fighting for people. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3311.0s)]
*  So I think like anything, it's a combo of substance and style. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3313.0s)]
*  And neither loan are both necessary. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3316.0s)]
*  Neither loan are sufficient. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3320.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I want to get into both the substance and the style debates and also just be honest and acknowledge that kind of some of the tactics available to you as a member of Congress representing a district are not available to Kamala Harris, right? [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3321.0s)]
*  Because she can't go to every county or every part of the country all the time. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3333.0s)]
*  But in your Twitter thread, you wrote, quote, It's not enough to throw these seemingly disparate policies of people. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3336.0s)]
*  We must articulate a unifying principle and clearly tell folks who's at fault. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3342.0s)]
*  For me, it was freedom and patriotism. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3346.0s)]
*  And the fault lies with the same elites in both parties who have run this country for too long. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3348.0s)]
*  First question, can you unpack the kind of freedom frame a little bit so voters know what that means or so listeners know what that means? [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3353.0s)]
*  And then second, I mean, again, just in fairness to Kamala Harris, like, do you think she could credibly deliver that kind of message after spending four years as the VP? [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3359.0s)]
*  Yeah, and I was feeling pretty feisty and that's the Twitter thread. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3368.0s)]
*  So forgive that. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3372.0s)]
*  Forgive that. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3373.0s)]
*  I think we're all feeling feisty right now and some other efforts. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3374.0s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, to me, I've been obsessed with especially my district being the home to FDR and spent a lot of time as presidential library got to hold his for freedom speech in my physical hands, which has a huge nerd was awesome and very impactful for me. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3378.0s)]
*  And I think that this in fact, I know freedom is the most unifying American value at a values level, setting aside politics and we could debate what the what freedom means. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3398.0s)]
*  But if we don't start from a place of like common values alignment where people can feel they have a home to come to, even if they don't agree on every single component, we're just already, I think, hurt out of the gate. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3409.0s)]
*  And so I talked about reproductive freedom, of course, given everything that happened in the last few years, I talked obsessively about economic freedom and echoing FDR freedom from want talked about freedom to breathe clean air and water freedom from gun violence, a lot of other freedoms. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3425.0s)]
*  And we really, I think, gave a place for people to feel like they could come out and vote for something instead of just against something. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3442.0s)]
*  I know all this can feels like a little cliche, obviously, but like we really felt that on the ground. And I think you're right. It's obviously much harder at a presidential national race to do constituent services in the way we did. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3451.0s)]
*  But I think we have to think about that like it's a team sport. Right. Right. We have a, we have a team we have a brand. And if we all work together, you can see, people should know oh hey that Democrat is representative like did a pretty good job and I can kind of project that other [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3467.0s)]
*  Democrats would would share that sort of ethos and understanding and work ethic. And I think we have a lot of room to improve clearly in in that area. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3483.0s)]
*  But I also just think it's a message discipline thing I mean we were just I was obsessed with affordability and costs and talking about all the dynamics and localizing it with specificity like the single biggest issue I talked about was a battle with one of our local utility [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3495.0s)]
*  monopolies that had totally screwed up their billing like thousands of people were irreparably harmed savings accounts wiped out by auto pay and we helped people with that in a very tangible visceral way. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3510.0s)]
*  And I think those things matter and also show our willingness to take on big corporate power. But in a way that's not just bumper sticker, but real. Right. Right. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3525.0s)]
*  Staying on this economic piece and speaking of spicy statements I'm sure you saw Bernie Sanders statement the Democrats have abandoned the working class. I read that statement for Bernie and on some level felt like yeah he has a point. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3535.0s)]
*  Democrats need to do more to deliver for working people in this country. But on the other hand, we all know the reality is that like Biden worked with Bernie to do a bunch of populist stuff including the child tax credit capping insulin at 35 bucks support for unions [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3546.0s)]
*  the list goes on voters decided no we're going to vote against the Democrats who did the populist stuff and for the Republicans that fought against those accomplishments and voted against those accomplishments. Similarly like they're like they saw Joe Biden walk on a picket line with unions and they voted for Donald Trump who put you who says he's going to put Elon Musk a guy who once said I disagree with the idea of unions in charge of like government efficiency or spending. And I'm wondering how you make sense of that disconnect. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3559.0s)]
*  I still think it's a little bit particularly for voters feeling torn or paying less attention because of all the other pressures in their lives. It's still a little bit too policy deep and not enough sort of upstream of politics values level alignment first. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3587.0s)]
*  And I just think it. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3607.0s)]
*  We lost a group of people around not really connecting with them whether that's the in person ways that I talked about at a congressional house level whether it's just actually what we choose to focus on from a message discipline perspective and what we don't choose to necessarily focus on. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3612.0s)]
*  But I think you got to start with the people trusting that you're for them. And if they don't think you're for them, all the rest just doesn't matter. I mean, so it's like what can you do to really show not tell but show that you're for people. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3630.0s)]
*  And in a lot of cases in my district that was like literally helping them recover money from the IRS or getting them a passport or we have to figure out how to make government actually deliver for people even if in small ways to start from a place of trust and then you can work on the bigger complex. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3645.0s)]
*  And I think it's like there's no shortcut here. We just actually have to rebuild ground up. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3664.0s)]
*  I mean, on this cultural front, you know, Andrew Breitbart, I think famously said that politics is downstream of culture. Democrats are soul searching and attacking each other on that front to some people say Democrats are elitist and annoying and that's why we lost others blame covid policies and lockdowns and masking others say Democrats are too focused on identity politics. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3682.0s)]
*  Your colleague Seth Moulton said Democrats were too worried about offending people and not honest about voter concerns about transgender athletes and youth sports. Do any of those buckets or this broader critique seem relevant to you based on the conversations you had with real voters? [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3702.0s)]
*  I'm not like a big finger pointing negative person. Obviously, it was a devastating loss, not just politically, but I would argue morally in the country to have Trump in the White House again. And I say this as somebody who, you know, a lot of people voted for him and voted for me in my district mathematically, but I've always been very clear and upfront about who he is. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3718.0s)]
*  And I think the threats and risks and the harm that he will do viscerally. But I just think we got to move forward. I mean, we just have to take the energy we have and talk about how to do better rather than the finger pointing and the blame. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3738.0s)]
*  And to me, it's an actual opportunity. I know that maybe it's a little too soon to say that, but I'm trying to be glass half full and to really lean into something. I think, unfortunately, in the next two years, we will see Trump's true colors again, as we saw for four years. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3754.0s)]
*  And people are going to need a place to come to after they really remember and see Trump 2.0 on steroids. And we have the moment now to build that. And to me, it is a patriotic place that we have to create. And I would argue almost like a patriotic populism. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3770.0s)]
*  I'm still thinking about the language here. Don't hold me to that one. But I think that is the alternative. Trump is a destructive populist. We need to be, I believe, constructive and unifying and positive while still being clear about the macroeconomic inequality and the immediate economic pain around affordability people are dealing with. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3790.0s)]
*  Yeah, the PP party. There we go. Just kidding. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3813.0s)]
*  Your old would agree with that. I would love that. Well, let me try it this way. Why do you think Democrats get coated as elite while Donald Trump, a guy who is like famous for being rich and elitist and famous and a former president does not? [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3817.0s)]
*  Because he's just real and no, I don't know if I'm allowed to care. It's just no bullshit. Like, just be straight up. I mean, there's so many already anecdotes coming out from this campaign, and we've all heard them for years. Like, I don't like a lot of things. I mean, I literally read a quote today if someone views him as an authoritarian, but at least he's, you know, real or something. I'm paraphrasing. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3830.0s)]
*  Like, it is again connecting on that level of are you for us? Or are you part of the elites in both parties and in institutions of business and in other places in this country that have largely like failed to help people with the pressure they're dealing with? And he is the one person who, or one of the few, who has really understood that, I think, at a visceral level and maximize on it, obviously. And we've got to have our own answer to it. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3852.0s)]
*  That is not destructive. But it's just, I think, just be real. Like, I talk all the time, especially, I think there's this whole conversation about young men. I talk obsessively about a more healthy, patriotic masculinity that isn't selfish, but provides a place for all people, but especially young people and young men to feel like they can be part of something bigger than themselves. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3882.0s)]
*  I talked to a lot of, you know, college age and high school age young people in my district, and they're all feeling like they just don't have a place. And we need to, I'm obsessed with the national service and going to be working on national service legislation because I think that's one of the ways we can help get at this. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3906.0s)]
*  Yeah, just a broader sense of community and being part of something bigger. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3923.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think people are desperate for it. And you think about that generation, they just essentially haven't seen it in our politics or in our country in very many ways. And I think the Democratic Party can and must be the place that offers that. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3927.0s)]
*  Yeah, we had some like ongoing, there's an ongoing debate as well about tactical decisions by the Harris campaign. We had a debate on this show about whether, you know, it was a mistake for Kamala Harris to focus at the end of the campaign on Trump's authoritarian instincts and calling him a fascist versus talking about the economy. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3942.0s)]
*  Now that we have the election results, I feel even more confident that talking about the fascism piece was a mistake, but much less confident that changing that message would have made almost any difference. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3961.0s)]
*  You know, the related debate is like whether it was a mistake to campaign with Liz Cheney versus, I don't know, doing some other sort of economic focused event. Do you think any of those tactical decisions mattered with only 100 days to go? [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3976.0s)]
*  I mean, how do you make sense of the broader headwinds that Kamala Harris was facing, the hangover frustration at Joe Biden versus what she could have actually controlled? [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=3990.0s)]
*  I think with the time she they had and she had and the constraints to your point structurally, they did. I think they did a very good job. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4000.0s)]
*  I mean, just to give you a sense, like in our district, President Biden in June before his debate performance was down 8% in a district he had won by 8%. So like a massive underwater point and then Kamala, Vice President Harris, won it by about 2%. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4010.0s)]
*  So you think in a few months, her entering the race moved our party like 10 points, which is remarkable in a few months in a battleground district. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4029.0s)]
*  I think we can all, I mean, my campaign, lots of things we tactically could improve on, but I think they did a very good job. And it's we got to zoom out and have the more macro conversation we're having up to this point, in my view, in terms of substance and style on connecting with the economic pain people are feeling and giving them both short and long term hope, again, that somebody gets it and is on the case. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4040.0s)]
*  Yeah, just on this cultural piece. I mean, we're about the same age, you know, like early 40s, some might say mid for me. You served in the military. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4069.0s)]
*  Also objective. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4078.0s)]
*  Also objective. You served in the military. I certainly did not. But like, I don't know, I grew up kind of bro-y like I played football and lacrosse and read Barstool sports and love the Patriots and the Red Sox, you know what I mean? [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4079.0s)]
*  And it feels like guys who look like us, like sort of white men are fleeing the Democratic Party. They think we're annoying. They think we care about cancel culture. I don't know, maybe they hated the COVID lockdown rules. I mean, when you're talking to younger men, what do you hear from them about why they think Democrats are now lame? Because we should be honest, they think we're lame. They think it's lame to be a Democrat. They think Trump is cool and kind of rock and roll and counterculture. And we just like lost that mantle. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4092.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's, I have a lot of, I'm part of a big Irish Catholic family. So I talk with a lot of my younger cousins. I'm the cousins, I'm the oldest of like 20 something. We've all lost count cousins. So I talk with them a lot as a little sort of focus group that they don't know they're participating in. And it is cultural, but it's more the things they've seen in the world they've watched of our two longest wars, a financial meltdown, Trump dominating and the whole tension between the two. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4121.0s)]
*  And the whole tension between the two is dominating and the whole tenor and tone of our politics ushered in by Trump, but now spread far and wide. And like, I just think they're deeply understandably turned off distrustful you look at voter registration of young people they're largely registering [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4150.0s)]
*  And I think that's a really cool thing to do. I think it's cool to have a lot of people that are like, I'm not a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Democrat, I'm a [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4168.0s)]
*  Democrat, I can at least come in and say, look, like, I love this country and I put my life on the line for this country and I still think we have, we're better than anyone else by far and I, you know, like, let's start there. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4198.0s)]
*  I think we've been able to, by appealing to some higher order patriotism, actually, I still think we're a deeply patriotic country and we were getting there but we didn't quite have enough time to make that far and widely known. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4214.0s)]
*  I really worry about the masculinity piece, too. I mean, the fact that, like, Andrew Tate is this dominating force, especially among teenagers, is really worrisome. He's one of the most, like, noxious, loathsome people on the internet, on the planet. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4232.0s)]
*  But also, you know, even just saying, like, we need a more different conversation about masculinity, like, I imagine me today going to Me20 and being like, hey, son, you want to have a conversation about masculinity? I'd be like, get the fuck away from me, you dork. Like, what are you talking about? You know? [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4244.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think, yeah. I mean, our most popular ad, which we put millions of dollars behind in this campaign in the New York City media market, was basically, like, me playing, building Legos with my five-year-old, reading with my two-year-old, like, wrestling them on the floor, talking about how I was a different kind of Democrat, not necessarily on a policy level but on that values and cultural level. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4258.0s)]
*  And I've done a few campaigns and a lot of ads. I've never seen or felt this kind of reaction to this ad where it was actually, like, pretty warm and pretty positive but felt, I just think people were like, thank you for, like, just not having negative, nasty ads all the time. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4282.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4300.0s)]
*  And I think people are actually searching for a healthier, more, again, I think positive and I would argue patriotic alternative on masculinity, we have to offer it and I think we can. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4301.0s)]
*  Because Thomas is so selfish and so ultimately isolating, I actually think, for a lot of people. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4315.0s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with that. And he's just such a whiner. Like, that's what I don't get why these young guys like him. Like, anyone who whined like that on the pickup basketball court, like, that he really won the whole time, like, you would hate that guy. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4322.0s)]
*  But somehow he makes it work. On the foreign policy front, I mean, only 4% of voters in exit polls said foreign policy was their top voting concern, but Trump won those voters with 55%. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4331.0s)]
*  There's some, like, specific issues that clearly impacted the race, like, Gaza and Ukraine, but bigger picture the thing that's worrying to me is this sentiment now that Democrats are the pro-war party and that Trump is anti-war. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4342.0s)]
*  And my friend, Peter Hamby, who writes for Puck and does a show on Snapchat, went to a bunch of college campuses and found kids that were genuinely worried about getting drafted, which obviously is not ever going to happen. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4355.0s)]
*  But the fact that that was a concern that came up over and over again, I think is notable. So, you know, you went to West Point, you served two tours in Iraq, you spent time in Afghanistan, you're on the Armed Services Committee now. Where do we go wrong? And how do you think Democrats get back this anti-war mantle? [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4368.0s)]
*  Well, I think I actually, I don't mean to be so dark here, but I actually think those kids aren't wrong. I mean, I think people intuitively understand whether you're a young person or someone who maybe even lived through and remembers World War II, which thankfully we still have a good number of those folks around. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4382.0s)]
*  Like, people get it and are way smarter than folks give them credit for. They understand how dangerous, volatile, divided, and increasingly authoritarian the world is. And in those moments, again, it's the temptation is to sort of reach for a strongman figure. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4399.0s)]
*  And I think we have, both for wonky national security and foreign policy reasons, need to find our voice in a way that projects more direction and strength. And I hate to, you may never have me on the show again, by quoting Ronald Reagan in terms of, you know, one of his more famous or infamous piece through strength. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4418.0s)]
*  But I do think that is kind of where the world is as I think about it. And strength needs to be defined differently and more broadly and not just militarily, but economically, technologically, intellectually, and academically. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4440.0s)]
*  And there's a real opportunity for us, I think, to rally the American people behind, again, this view of the world is dangerous. We're seeing China, Iran, Russia, North Korea now all kind of coming together in ways that are concerning. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4454.0s)]
*  We need to lean in, in order to prevent war. And I think that's how we need to be talking about it more, which we don't. In order to prevent war, really reinvest and come together as a country. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4469.0s)]
*  It might be the last sort of hope, I think, to bring us back together in a way that averts a World War III scenario. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4480.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think there's a lot of truth to that. And I do think people really vote on base feelings, right? Strong, weak, etc. But I also heard so many focus groups and anecdotal pieces of evidence where young people in particular of all races, genders, etc. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4491.0s)]
*  And I think that's a really good example of why we're sending all this money to Ukraine. That's crazy and stupid. I want to spend that here. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4507.0s)]
*  And that's just a long explanation to explain why. And that kind of nativism, I think, was powerful for Trump and very effective. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4511.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think there is a tight case to be made in terms of essentially de-wonkifying deterrence. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4520.0s)]
*  I'm not saying I'm the expert at this, but I think we have to be making that case less about supporting Ukraine as much as I support Ukraine, more about stopping Putin and stopping the growing cooperation with these other parties. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4530.0s)]
*  And it's a fine line that I actually really wrestle with this idea of like, you don't want to create a boogeyman to the degree that then creates the inevitable security dilemma and escalates into war. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4546.0s)]
*  But at the same time, I think not being clear about who the threats are and what the risks are leaves a vacuum for people to misinterpret why we're doing the things we're doing. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4556.0s)]
*  And they're like, well, it just feels like we're treading water and holding the status quo. And in fact, we're not. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4567.0s)]
*  And I actually think the Biden administration has got not everything, but a lot right in this regard. And yet no one feels that way, obviously, to your points. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4572.0s)]
*  And again, it comes back to us and them. And I just don't think we've clarified like, what is the answer? The our equivalent to America first has to be again, a more or less selfish and more unifying view of reinvesting here at home to keep us safe and strong abroad. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4581.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's right. I also think people saw. I mean, I think the voters really did not like and rejected was hearing about the United States sending billions and billions and billions of weapons, dollars worth of weapons to be used in Gaza only to see both the horrific civilian cost of that war, but also to see it and mysticize and spread into Lebanon in these closing months before the election. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4603.0s)]
*  I don't think those images did the Biden administration and then Kamala Harris. Any good? [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4626.0s)]
*  No. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4630.0s)]
*  Last question for you. So, you know, it looks like Democrats are likely to be in the minority in the House, which will give Donald Trump total control of the U.S. government. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4631.0s)]
*  We know that means all committees are Republican. Dems will not have subpoena power. But what do you think the role what can Democrats do from the opposition in the House from your perspective? What do you want to accomplish in the next two years? [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4639.0s)]
*  Small question. Yeah, yeah. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4653.0s)]
*  You start drinking now. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4655.0s)]
*  I mean, look, I, I almost feel foolish saying it given what happened between 2016 and 2020 but I do think there are a few areas where doing my job as a representative like maybe there's some space to work with the administration to relieve some of the particular economic pain and [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4657.0s)]
*  pressure we talked about. But I think that's very, very unlikely, just given both past performance and all the promises he's made in Project 2025. And I mean, I believe that is the plan 100%. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4673.0s)]
*  And so we got to be manning the the ramparts and holding the line. And I think we're gonna have to get real creative and scrappy and be willing to really shake things up in terms of the tactics, in terms of communication and like if we're using the current [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4685.0s)]
*  current instant sort of powers of the institutions, we're going to get rolled. We need to be much smarter using new communication styles using, you know, I don't have the answers yet but I think we got to put our heads together and think about, you know, actually thought it was pretty cool. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4703.0s)]
*  I haven't even read it yet but one of my colleagues who unfortunately got gerrymandered out Wiley Nickel just wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post saying, we should have a shadow cabinet and start operating the way they do in, in the UK like I don't know if that works but like, we need to be doing things differently understanding Trump is on the march towards an authoritarian if not fascist way of governing, and that requires us to really step up our game. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4721.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. Well, Congressman Ryan, thank you so much for for doing the show. Everyone should check out your Twitter thread because there are even more really interesting ideas and arguments in there for what Dems got right and what we got wrong. And I appreciate you being willing to talk to us today and just generally speak candidly about it because I know it's not not easy to criticize your friends sometimes but it's important. So thanks. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4749.0s)]
*  Yeah, no thanks for having me. It is Veterans Day so I'd be remiss not thanking all those that have have served my fellow veterans of all generations. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4771.0s)]
*  Well said. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4780.0s)]
*  That's our show for today. One last item. Did you notice, Lovett, you want to talk about this? [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4781.0s)]
*  Oh yes. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4786.0s)]
*  The idea has been floated that Joe Biden has the opportunity to do something awesome. And that is to resign and make Kamala Harris the nation's first female president. And this is an idea that I already have endorsed on Lovett Relief. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4789.0s)]
*  You have? [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4802.0s)]
*  Yeah, as a joke. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4803.0s)]
*  This came from Jamal Simmons who is Kamala Harris's former communications director for those of our listeners who don't know. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4804.0s)]
*  And I think it's beautiful. And I think you should do it. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4809.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4814.0s)]
*  Look, I think that I think it's I think it's treating the presidency like it's a fucking participation trophy. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4815.0s)]
*  No, obviously, obviously, obviously. I just think, look, I would be so offended if I was Kamala Harris. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4822.0s)]
*  Yes, I don't I don't think I don't think Joe Biden should decide whether or not to make Kamala Harris president. I think God should. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4827.0s)]
*  I obviously don't think that Joe Biden should resign in order to make Kamala Harris a good job president. Way to go, sis, president. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4834.0s)]
*  Imagine after four years of us pointing out that Donald Trump wouldn't accept the results of an election, Joe Biden appointed the person who just lost to the presidency. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4843.0s)]
*  What message would that send? I know it's temporary. I know it's a different scenario. But can you imagine what the Republicans would say? [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4854.0s)]
*  But Tommy, isn't it true that there are 15 million missing votes out there? [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4861.0s)]
*  15 million missing votes. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4867.0s)]
*  Just everyone. Just so we should just knock it down. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4869.0s)]
*  It's there's some stuff going around. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4871.0s)]
*  Even some people who are like reporter, former reporters. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4873.0s)]
*  I've seen this a couple of places that like, oh, my gosh, you got like 15 million less votes and blah, blah, blah. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4876.0s)]
*  And I've heard it from like people out and out in the world. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4881.0s)]
*  Just so you guys all know, like the turnout numbers, they have not finished counting California yet. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4883.0s)]
*  And when you do the projections, New York Times, whoever it may be, they think that Trump's going to win by one point five percent and that Kamala Harris probably ends up with five million less fewer votes than Joe Biden. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4891.0s)]
*  And Donald Trump ends up with four million more votes than he got in in 2020. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4903.0s)]
*  And by the way, turnout almost the same little slightly less in 2024. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4908.0s)]
*  Probably is going to end up with like two, three million votes less. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4912.0s)]
*  Yes. The somebody sent me the conspiracy theory. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4916.0s)]
*  Oh, no. Texted me and said, what do you think about this? [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4919.0s)]
*  They're just one or they're a couple. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4922.0s)]
*  And I and I said, who sent you this? [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4923.0s)]
*  And they said a very famous person. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4924.0s)]
*  And I said, tell that person to go for a walk outside. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4926.0s)]
*  And it actually like for the same reason. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4929.0s)]
*  No, the election wasn't stolen in 2020. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4932.0s)]
*  No, there's not some conspiracy to steal 15 million votes this time. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4934.0s)]
*  Actually, another reason that Donald Trump may have some trouble becoming the authoritarian he wants to become. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4937.0s)]
*  America is big and complicated with various levels of government that make command and control of this big, messy country incredibly difficult, if not completely impossible. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4942.0s)]
*  And like that's why our elections are more secure. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4952.0s)]
*  That's why the conspiracy theories are fucking stupid. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4955.0s)]
*  And that is my hope as well. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4959.0s)]
*  But if you want to find those 15 million missing votes, I bet they're in the same place as that 13th key. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4961.0s)]
*  They would have to print a lot. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4967.0s)]
*  If Kamala Harris did become president over the next month, they would have to reprint a lot of hats. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4968.0s)]
*  That's probably it would be expensive. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4973.0s)]
*  That piece of this is very funny. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4975.0s)]
*  Just for a day. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4976.0s)]
*  Just for a day. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4977.0s)]
*  That's cool. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4978.0s)]
*  Now, you know what? [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4979.0s)]
*  Now I flipped. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4980.0s)]
*  No, I'm for it. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4981.0s)]
*  That's our show for today. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4982.0s)]
*  I'll be back on Wednesday with a new episode featuring guest host Ezra Klein. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4983.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4987.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4988.0s)]
*  Just the two of us and Nancy Pelosi. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4989.0s)]
*  We're going to talk about all the latest and where Democrats go from here. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4992.0s)]
*  So talk to you then. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4995.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYBtY0TsSE&t=4998.0s)]
