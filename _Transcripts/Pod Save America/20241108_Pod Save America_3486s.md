Video Description: As Kamala Harris officially concedes after a terrible election, Democrats begin searching for lessons—and singling out others for blame. Jon, Lovett, Dan, and Tommy discuss Harris's farewell message, the various conflicting and enraging theories being floated as to why she lost, and how we should think about campaigns going forward. Plus: Sen. Jacky Rosen appears to score a win in Nevada, and Democratic House candidates in uncalled races see a path to victory—and maybe even a narrow majority.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# The Worst Takes About Donald Trump, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris' 2024 Election
**Pod Save America:** [November 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM)

*  Tuesday was for voting Wednesday was for processing and Thursday was for blaming [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=5.82s)]
*  just [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=11.700000000000001s)]
*  blame blame blame blame just 48 hours after Americans went to the polls the Democratic Party [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=13.34s)]
*  Recrimination soul-searching post-mortem blame game pick your cliche has begun [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=18.64s)]
*  Plus and some critical good news for Democrats Senator Jackie Rosen [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=23.94s)]
*  Looks like she's gonna hang on in, Nevada [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=28.119999999999997s)]
*  We'll talk about the latest updates with the ballots still being counted in House and Senate races all across the country and what it all [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=30.28s)]
*  Means for fighting back against Trump's second term agenda [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=36.42s)]
*  hurt saying that [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=40.64s)]
*  but first [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=42.68s)]
*  On Wednesday Kamala Harris officially conceded to Donald Trump in a phone call and then gave her concession speech at Howard University [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=44.04s)]
*  Where she hoped she'd be giving her victory speech the night before [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=50.599999999999994s)]
*  Then on Thursday Joe Biden gave his first public remarks since his vice president's crushing loss [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=54.019999999999996s)]
*  Here is a sampling from each [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=60.459999999999994s)]
*  So the young people who are watching it is okay to feel sad and disappointed [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=62.81999999999999s)]
*  But please know it's gonna be okay on the campaign. I would often say when we fight we win [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=68.94s)]
*  But here's the thing. Here's the thing [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=77.02s)]
*  Sometimes the fight takes a while [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=79.82s)]
*  That doesn't mean we won't win [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=82.58s)]
*  That doesn't mean we won't win [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=85.33999999999999s)]
*  The important thing is don't ever give up [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=88.77999999999999s)]
*  Don't ever give up don't ever stop trying to make the world a better place [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=92.66s)]
*  We're leaving behind the strongest economy in the world. I know people are still hurting [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=99.69999999999999s)]
*  But things are changing rapidly [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=106.85999999999999s)]
*  Together we've changed America for the better [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=109.78s)]
*  Now we have 74 days to finish the term our turn [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=112.9s)]
*  Let's make everyday count [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=117.82s)]
*  That's the responsibility we have to the American people [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=120.53999999999999s)]
*  Look folks, you all know it your lives [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=124.58s)]
*  Setbacks are unavoidable, but giving up is unforgivable getting harder and harder to tell the difference between him and Dana Carvey [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=127.62s)]
*  So both Biden and Harris offered versions of it's gonna be okay [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=135.12s)]
*  This is of course after they both spent their respective campaigns hammering the stakes of a Trump presidency [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=142.96s)]
*  Obviously, that's a tough balance to strike [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=148.52s)]
*  What did you guys think and any other reactions to either of their? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=151.04s)]
*  speeches [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=155.68s)]
*  I find that we're gonna be okay pretty insulting and patronizing to be honest [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=157.2s)]
*  You're both giving these speeches because your theory of politics and of the future was wrong that we all were wrong [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=162.0s)]
*  We're collectively wrong [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=169.32s)]
*  But that's just a fact and like I have great respect for Kamala Harris and the campaign that she ran and the hand she played [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=171.32s)]
*  It was very difficult hand, but they're just not in a position to reassure us right now and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=178.44s)]
*  They don't know we don't know [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=183.76s)]
*  And the we will make it through [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=186.44s)]
*  I believe so I think we have to fight to make it so but a lot of people will be hurt [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=188.56s)]
*  Like if we keep sliding back on like reproductive freedom a lot of people could die if we [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=193.48s)]
*  Have mass deportations. There will be the children of American citizens who will not be okay if there are [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=200.64s)]
*  Robot backs on LGBT rights there will be trans people and gay people who will not be okay [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=206.36s)]
*  So I am not really in the market for bedtime sleep [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=210.6s)]
*  So I am not really in the market for bedtime stories right now [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=214.68s)]
*  I would like a little bit less reassurance and more vigilance and I think [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=219.08s)]
*  Politicians getting up there and and being our our mommy and daddy. I'm just not interested in right now [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=226.32s)]
*  Anyone else want to take the other side? No, I want to I want to I want to can think a middle ground sure [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=233.36s)]
*  These are impossible speeches to give they you're there to simply just acknowledge your own defeat and then thank your supporters and [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=239.29999999999998s)]
*  That you kind of have to do it [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=249.45999999999998s)]
*  None of them are are great some of them are remembered more fondly than others [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=251.5s)]
*  the hard part here is the absolute dissonance between [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=255.73999999999998s)]
*  The message 72 hours ago on the campaign trail and right now about what a danger Donald Trump is that he is unstable [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=259.5s)]
*  Unhinged will be governing without guardrails [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=266.34s)]
*  And I think both the vice president and the president could have done more to acknowledge people's fear [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=268.18s)]
*  people's pain they're feeling right now their [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=274.7s)]
*  anxiety about what's gonna come in the country to [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=278.42s)]
*  You know speak to [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=281.9s)]
*  The fact that for the second time in three presidential elections a woman has lost to someone like Donald Trump [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=283.74s)]
*  I was just talking to my wife who is [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=289.48s)]
*  Talking to was talking to her mom about not never having seen [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=292.06s)]
*  a woman elected president and trying to explain to her six-year-old daughter why that hasn't happened and I think [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=295.98s)]
*  this is hard to do but a [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=301.06s)]
*  Lot of people don't feel okay right now a lot of people aren't sure that we're gonna be okay [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=304.21999999999997s)]
*  A lot of people are very worried and so doing a little more to speak to that. I think would have been appreciated in the moment [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=307.28s)]
*  It just echoing dance water. You got a text from a friend [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=313.46s)]
*  I love who's like I'm really surprised you guys didn't mention Kamala Harris is race and gender and the reasoning behind why she lost [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=316.02s)]
*  Yesterday and [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=321.78000000000003s)]
*  The reason for me is I have no doubt that it was a factor in a lot of voters decision [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=322.98s)]
*  But I don't have any data to ground that opinion in right now [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=327.62s)]
*  And I also don't want the takeaway from that conversation to be well now the Democrats can never run a woman for president again [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=330.98s)]
*  Because I do not think that's true. I actually think I think that would be the worst lesson to take away [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=337.48s)]
*  So I think just to address, you know what Dan said up front [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=342.14s)]
*  I found both of their speeches to be like gracious and decent and especially for Kamala Harris because [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=344.90000000000003s)]
*  Think about you. She's spent a hundred days pouring everything she had into this campaign. She's exhausted even in her private moments [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=351.5s)]
*  She's thinking about this campaign. She hasn't slept in months and she's expected [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=357.34000000000003s)]
*  I think to actually take on a bit of a [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=362.14000000000004s)]
*  Parental role in the tone of her remarks and to to comfort supporters and voters and people that loved her and I understand that that might [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=364.34000000000003s)]
*  Be grating to some people like there's a naive version of like we're all gonna be okay. It's like no, you don't know that [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=371.70000000000005s)]
*  I think their point is we are all now charged with fighting to make sure that we're okay [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=376.70000000000005s)]
*  Especially for people that have it worse for us. I think that was that was the takeaway I got from them [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=382.74s)]
*  Yeah, it didn't bump me as much just because I think we're gonna be okay is just almost everyone understands that it might not be true [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=388.74s)]
*  But it's what you want to hear because people want to be comforted in a time like this [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=396.52000000000004s)]
*  Like I'm sure we're all getting texts from people and emails. They're like, are we gonna be okay? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=399.5s)]
*  Okay, and I don't assure anyone will be okay, but we can be okay like it's possible that we can be okay [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=403.06s)]
*  We don't know I don't actually think it's useful to spend a lot of time predicting whether we won't be okay or will be okay [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=409.26s)]
*  I think it's about as useful as predicting election winners [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=414.82s)]
*  Which is why I don't I don't really focus on that but silver model dark, okay [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=419.62s)]
*  Which I don't focus on that as much but I kind of just took it as like [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=424.74s)]
*  Leadership is about trying to comfort people or inspire people or whatever and I get I take your point [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=428.85999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think it's I didn't really bump me as much [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=433.53999999999996s)]
*  I had the same reaction to brought similar reaction to Barack Obama's remarks after the election and in 2016 [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=436.09999999999997s)]
*  you know, it's funny is [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=442.18s)]
*  Our our friend Terry's who plat who was a speechwriter with us in the White House [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=443.94s)]
*  Just has a new book out and I was doing a book event with him and in in his book [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=447.52s)]
*  He talks about how the only time in his life he'd ever been disappointed with Barack Obama was that speech that speech [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=450.74s)]
*  But then he said, you know looking back on it now all these years later [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=455.9s)]
*  I'm glad he said what he did at the time because at the time everyone didn't want to hear that [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=459.14s)]
*  But he's like, you know, he was right. He was right [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=463.09999999999997s)]
*  So even though Biden and Harris both said nice things about each other in their speeches [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=466.94s)]
*  It's knives out at the staff and advisor level [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=472.34s)]
*  People close to both camps have been making their case to reporters pro-biden Democrats saying the president would have done better [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=475.58s)]
*  And that Harris could have run a better campaign [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=481.34000000000003s)]
*  Pro Harris Democrats saying it was Biden's fault for deciding to run for re-election in the first place and waiting too long to step aside [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=483.7s)]
*  What do you guys think? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=491.02000000000004s)]
*  You do a blanket caveat, which is that so we don't all have to repeat it [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=492.86s)]
*  Running a presidential campaign and putting it together in a hundred days is nearly impossible [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=497.02000000000004s)]
*  She did an incredible job the biggest moment of the entire campaign [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=500.42s)]
*  Maybe the only one that mattered was the debate and she did better than anyone could possibly have expected [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=503.26s)]
*  So blanket caveat now, we're gonna nitpick [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=508.46000000000004s)]
*  Great [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=512.86s)]
*  Do you want to go happy to nitpick I was just giving someone else space to speak [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=515.86s)]
*  Okay, do you want to start with the who which side do you great now? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=519.46s)]
*  I'm gonna nitpick [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=522.86s)]
*  so the substantive critique from the Biden people seems to be two things that she abandoned the kind of anti populist messaging and that she [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=523.7s)]
*  failed to respond to [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=531.4200000000001s)]
*  Millions and millions of dollars these anti-trans ads that ran on every football game we ever watched [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=533.54s)]
*  I didn't find those to be unfair or unreasonable [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=537.74s)]
*  Criticisms. I mean the tenth time I saw the the Kamala is for they them ad [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=540.7800000000001s)]
*  I wondered boy did it their own people know something that we don't know about how effective that ad is [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=544.82s)]
*  And the New York Times reported today that one feature forward the big damn super PAC tested the ad it moved the needle [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=550.86s)]
*  2.7 percentage points in Trump's favor and that the Harris campaign tested a response ad that didn't work [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=555.82s)]
*  Well in focus groups, so they never ended up using it [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=561.58s)]
*  I think maybe it's fair to say that letting that go unresponded to was a mistake. Here's the problem with that [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=564.14s)]
*  Kamala Harris in the states where Kamala Harris campaign the hardest those are the places where she outperformed [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=571.26s)]
*  What happened in the other states? Those are also the states that saw the most number of ads [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=577.02s)]
*  So, I mean if you just if you just said okay, what was the effect? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=582.46s)]
*  I mean, it's hard to measure all these different competing variables [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=585.58s)]
*  But if you just said alright, there were states where they ran anti-trans ads [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=588.02s)]
*  And there are states where they didn't Trump did better in states where they didn't run those ads [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=592.4599999999999s)]
*  That's just a thought a lot of those ran nationally [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=595.86s)]
*  Even so there was a hundred million dollars dumped in Pennsylvania of anti-trans ads and you can say alright [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=599.86s)]
*  Well, what was the impact of that money? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=604.9399999999999s)]
*  Maybe it made things harder for her to claw back. Maybe she would have done better if those ads weren't there [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=606.98s)]
*  I just I just don't think we know right now [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=611.14s)]
*  broadly speaking that's why like if I have one the one nagging feeling I have is [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=613.18s)]
*  That that kind of is resonating with me is because we felt it a bit at the time and which is that answer on the view [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=619.22s)]
*  How would you do differently than Joe Biden and she says well, I can't think of anything or when she's asked about why she how [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=625.7s)]
*  She changed her record from 2020. She had answers that were about well, I haven't changed my values and [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=630.8s)]
*  They tried to deal with what was I think a incredibly difficult [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=635.58s)]
*  Substantive critique which is you're in the Biden administration. You don't represent a break from the Biden administration [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=640.26s)]
*  How do you respond to that they tried to kind of weave a kind of more like vibes based [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=646.5s)]
*  Message based argument against that and then in the same on her how she differed [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=652.74s)]
*  Because there she was hard to answer that question of how she had differed from the position [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=656.66s)]
*  She took in the 2020 campaign and I say okay could that be something that has an impact? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=660.22s)]
*  But even still I say okay, maybe those were bad. Maybe those were a problem fine [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=664.94s)]
*  I am still it still seems very difficult for me to picture how she overcomes the fact that she had a hundred days to run [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=670.54s)]
*  This campaign and so I am I am much more amenable to an argument about Joe Biden's culpability [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=676.3399999999999s)]
*  And actually I'm less angry about the decision to seek reelection. I don't I don't think it was right [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=682.78s)]
*  I think we're paying for it [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=688.3s)]
*  But I'm more angry actually about the month after that debate when what happened was unequivocal and he made that campaign even shorter [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=689.62s)]
*  Eliminating the chance to even have a debate about who the nominee should be and also leaving her such a short short space to mount a credible campaign [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=697.0600000000001s)]
*  I mean, I just I struggle with this entire conversation of I [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=704.02s)]
*  Can I can pick 17 things that maybe could have been done differently [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=710.54s)]
*  I can't pinpoint any of them or all of them that lead to a different outcome. Yeah in this race [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=714.22s)]
*  That's true [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=718.5s)]
*  and so the way I think to think about it going forward is [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=719.02s)]
*  To try to figure out what from the campaign sort of overlaying what the campaign did with the results on [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=723.34s)]
*  What we can learn in terms of going forward like what are better approaches better strategies better messages on that note. I do think [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=730.82s)]
*  It's funny for a campaign that was so good about [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=738.26s)]
*  tailoring their message to what tested well the [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=742.34s)]
*  This was like a hobby horse of mine during the campaign the price gouging stuff [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=746.42s)]
*  Like she started with it and then it sort of fell off in the middle of the campaign somewhere and then they kind of brought [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=750.34s)]
*  it back and it what the economic agenda was framed more as [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=755.02s)]
*  Small businesses this gonna maybe give you this gonna maybe give you this and there wasn't a lot of bite against [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=759.02s)]
*  corporations that were doing bad things [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=765.82s)]
*  And again, I'm just talking about going forward [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=768.9s)]
*  I think it would be useful for Democrats to hammer that because you do need people are people are angry [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=772.58s)]
*  people are dissatisfied most of the economy and [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=780.3000000000001s)]
*  I think it is fair and also politically useful to go after corporations that are making record profits and [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=783.66s)]
*  Screwing people over [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=791.26s)]
*  When they are screwing people over you don't have to say all corporations are bad or capital is bad [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=792.82s)]
*  No, I'm not gonna any of that [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=796.26s)]
*  but like I think it's a good thing to do and she had a record on [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=797.3000000000001s)]
*  Those issues as attorney general that I think was very effective and I'm even voters that I talked to when I brought up her [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=801.1800000000001s)]
*  Record it that moved them. So I think maybe the way to think about this is [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=806.74s)]
*  The Democratic economic message has not worked in 12 years. It did not work in 2016. It did not work in [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=812.26s)]
*  2020 we lost on the economy in 2022. We won despite despite our economic message [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=819.86s)]
*  We lost the voters who cared about it. Do we have an economic message? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=825.0600000000001s)]
*  Well, we had Biden's economic record Biden did all these things. He talked about them it [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=828.78s)]
*  Democrats ran they did run a decent number of economic ads [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=833.78s)]
*  But we won the voters who the 27 percent of voters who said abortion was their top issue [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=836.0200000000001s)]
*  We lost 31 percent of voters who said inflation was their top issue in 2022 their economic message did not work here yet [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=840.0600000000001s)]
*  Once again when you go through all of you test all the individual policies all our policies are popular [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=846.22s)]
*  but we're getting hammered on the most important issue in every single election in modern history and [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=849.7s)]
*  That is the thing we're going to have to figure out to go forward because Donald Trump has built [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=855.0600000000001s)]
*  What looks like a multiracial working-class coalition that could dominate politics for a very long time? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=859.1800000000001s)]
*  I understand why everyone's calling it like the anti-trans ad but I would even go one step further and say that the that ad had an [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=864.9s)]
*  economic component to it because it was what was it about [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=871.74s)]
*  taxpayer-funded [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=876.38s)]
*  gender reassignment surgery for [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=878.1s)]
*  inmates who are undocumented immigrants and [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=880.98s)]
*  It got right to the heart of a Republican argument that Democrats are giving your tax dollars away [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=884.06s)]
*  To everyone else all these different interest groups identity groups people that aren't you and you're struggling [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=891.02s)]
*  Right like that is what that ad was saying which I think to the extent it was effective [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=896.78s)]
*  You know Republicans have tried to run other anti-trans ads over the last several years in other races that have not been [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=901.38s)]
*  Effective they've been a waste of money. They've been a waste of money and they failed. It just sounds crazy [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=907.7s)]
*  It just sounds like a crazy the way they're doing that that sounds crazy to me. How can that be true? Yes, yeah [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=911.7s)]
*  Yeah [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=916.78s)]
*  So it turns out there's a third option here beside it being the Biden campaign's fault or the Harris campaign's fault [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=917.98s)]
*  It was the Obama campaign's fault. It was Obama's fault [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=923.26s)]
*  Here's a blind quote given to Politico by an anonymous former Biden staffer [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=927.38s)]
*  Quote there is no singular reason why we lost [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=932.14s)]
*  But a big reason is because the Obama advisors publicly encouraged Democratic infighting to push Joe Biden out [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=935.62s)]
*  Didn't even want Kamala Harris as the nominee and then signed up as the saviors of the campaign only to run [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=941.9200000000001s)]
*  outdated Obama era playbooks [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=948.2s)]
*  For a candidate that wasn't Obama. There's outdated Obama era playbooks that won him two presidential campaigns [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=950.24s)]
*  The best record of any Democrat since Roosevelt. But anyway, I [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=958.16s)]
*  Just have to say something about this one. Please don't go if the floor is yours. I am going to generously [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=962.4s)]
*  Assume that the constant anonymous sniping from Biden world about Obama or Kamala Harris and [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=967.88s)]
*  Everyone who worked for them is coming from like the same three or four people [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=974.56s)]
*  That's that's gonna be my generous assumption and it does not reflect the views of most of the Biden folks [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=978.28s)]
*  Just stipulate it like Tommy stipulation earlier. We have a blanket caveat. Yeah, we all agree [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=982.8399999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden's decision to run for president again was a catastrophic mistake. It just was and he in his inner circle [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=988.76s)]
*  They refused to believe the polls. They refused to believe he was unpopular [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=995.3s)]
*  They refused to acknowledge until very late that anyone could be upset about inflation [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=999.18s)]
*  And they just kept telling us that his presidency was historic and it was the greatest economy ever [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1004.5s)]
*  We just heard him again say that it's the greatest economy ever clearly [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1008.38s)]
*  70 80 percent of voters don't believe that they don't believe that about their own personal financial situation [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1012.4599999999999s)]
*  But they just keep telling us that and then after the debate the Biden people told us that the polls were fine [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1017.54s)]
*  And Biden was still the strongest candidate and the but and [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1022.92s)]
*  They were privately telling reporters at the time that Kamala Harris couldn't win [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1027.12s)]
*  So they were shivving Kamala Harris to reporters while they told everyone else not a time for an open process and his vice president [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1031.4s)]
*  Can't win so he's the strongest candidate [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1038.8s)]
*  then we find out when Kamala Harris when the Harris when the Biden campaign becomes the Harris campaign that the [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1040.56s)]
*  Biden campaign's own internal polling at the time when they were telling us [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1047.04s)]
*  The strongest candidate showed that Donald Trump was gonna win 400 electoral votes. That's what their own internal polling said [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1050.12s)]
*  so like I don't have a lot of [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1056.08s)]
*  A lot of I just I don't know what it means by the Obama era playbook [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1058.72s)]
*  I think what Dan said yesterday about they just don't think but let's just try to unpack it [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1062.6999999999998s)]
*  I think what Dan said yesterday about trying to examine [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1067.76s)]
*  reexamine all the money Democrats spend on field programs is something that it's a conversation worth having because [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1071.1999999999998s)]
*  Like I don't overreact here because in 2020 there were people saying [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1078.0s)]
*  Well, the Biden people were too scared to get out of their house and knock on doors and did everything virtually [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1081.88s)]
*  And that's why the margins were closer, right? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1087.0800000000002s)]
*  So we kind of learn a new lesson every cycle [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1089.2s)]
*  But I think it's worth thinking about that spend and the opportunity cost that said all that [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1091.8s)]
*  Infrastructure was in place when Joe Biden was the nominee. This wasn't like an Obama thing or a Kamala Harris thing [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1098.02s)]
*  and then also just [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1102.16s)]
*  Part of this could be [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1105.0s)]
*  Democrats do need to go back to the drawing board when it comes to figuring out what is the coalition that we assemble to win [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1106.48s)]
*  Right the Obama era coalition [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1111.6200000000001s)]
*  That is it seems to be we've lost it that is gone [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1113.92s)]
*  But the on the idea that Joe Biden would have won I think is what the subtext of that comment was again [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1116.8400000000001s)]
*  There were polls showing 80% of voters thought Joe Biden was too old to get a second term before the debate [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1122.24s)]
*  And then we all watched the debate and then in the last few weeks [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1127.8600000000001s)]
*  Biden was campaigning and he said we need to lock Trump up [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1131.16s)]
*  He created a controversy over whether Trump supporters were garbage [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1135.16s)]
*  He said, you know the weird thing about slapping Trump on the ass like his moments on the campaign trail worked flawless either [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1138.72s)]
*  You cannot you look it's absurd [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1145.6s)]
*  Two points. I want to go [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1148.72s)]
*  I'm done being I want to stay for the record. I also think all the TV money that should be [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1151.48s)]
*  Should be rethought to rethought to but more importantly [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1155.96s)]
*  The idea that Joe Biden was going to do better in this race the couple Harris is on its face absurd [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1160.1599999999999s)]
*  No one is making that zero data to support that there never has been ever and no one is making that case with their name [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1165.6s)]
*  To it that's what I was I was gonna end by saying like if someone would like to put their name on it or even come [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1171.54s)]
*  Here and and and talk to us about it right here. We can have a nice civil conversation about it [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1177.32s)]
*  They're more than welcome and it's a lot better than just sniping to Alex Thompson and [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1181.76s)]
*  Politico and whoever else you want to snipe, you know [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1186.24s)]
*  Leaked to which is what they've been doing for a year [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1189.1200000000001s)]
*  Why the suboptimal place we were put in after the debate was to go from a close to zero percent chance of winning [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1191.0400000000002s)]
*  To someone who had a chance but was probably an underdog in the race and that's where we went and that's how it ended [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1196.5200000000002s)]
*  We know that we know that we know that because over a hundred days of an extraordinarily well-run campaign [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1201.3400000000001s)]
*  She clawed her way back on all these metrics on which Biden was doing much worse [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1207.2s)]
*  And she and she lost by what two points and I like [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1212.06s)]
*  maybe one sign for hope in all of this is [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1217.06s)]
*  It's there's gonna be a lot of in fighting as all people with different points of views about the future [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1220.46s)]
*  We have to be generous with one another we have to listen to one another would be open to one another [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1224.08s)]
*  But we can all unite in knowing that Joe Biden would have lost and deserves a lot of blame for the situation that we're in [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1227.18s)]
*  And maybe that's something that can bring us all together [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1232.46s)]
*  Well, I mean also when Harris became the nominee Obama people Clinton people Biden people [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1234.26s)]
*  Like they all came together in that campaign and did a fucking it got really close to winning, you know [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1241.62s)]
*  And they all worked really well together and they all put their heart and soul into it and they worked their asses off, right? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1247.44s)]
*  So it's like this idea that there's all these divisions and blah blah blah [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1253.3s)]
*  It's like the people who just continue to do this [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1256.3s)]
*  It's crazy because a lot of people from that word had a whole bunch of different bosses all came together to work hard to try [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1258.58s)]
*  to get her to win [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1264.26s)]
*  So beyond the Biden Harris sniping there have been a number of other broader critiques about the Democratic Party that we can talk about [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1265.78s)]
*  Bernie Sanders [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1271.18s)]
*  Whoever the summer had lobbied for Biden to stay in the race, but then became one of Harris's most effective surrogates [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1272.74s)]
*  released a blistering critique of Democrats whole strategy and identity saying quote [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1278.06s)]
*  It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working-class people [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1282.66s)]
*  Would find that the working class has abandoned them and then blamed the big money interests and well-paid [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1286.94s)]
*  Consultants who control the party and he expressed skepticism that we'll be able to learn our lesson. He later told the New York Times [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1292.5s)]
*  It's not just Kamala. It's a Democratic Party which increasingly has become a party of identity politics [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1298.34s)]
*  Rather than understanding that the vast majority of people in this country are working-class [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1303.74s)]
*  What did you guys think of Bernie's? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1308.4199999999998s)]
*  Critique is he right that the Democratic Party has abandoned the working-class [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1310.6599999999999s)]
*  so my [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1315.46s)]
*  My problem with the statement so I largely think that like there is a directional [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1317.54s)]
*  Critique that I agree with right that like when Bernie came on Ponce America and talked about we were not talking enough about [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1323.3s)]
*  Corporate influence over politics the money in our politics [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1327.98s)]
*  We're not talking enough to those concerns of the working class like I believe that I agree with that [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1330.22s)]
*  I think the nuance that is missing here and I think is important is Joe Biden [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1334.22s)]
*  When he won and one of I think his great achievements and one of things we talked about when we were beseeching Joe Biden to step [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1339.74s)]
*  Aside is that he listened he brought in Bernie Sanders. He brought in Elizabeth Warren. He put Lena Kahn at FTC [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1345.06s)]
*  He canceled student debt. He pursued an incredibly progressive economic agenda now [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1351.06s)]
*  I think we should think about why did that not resonate with people? Why do people not believe that? [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1356.46s)]
*  Why did people not see the effects of that? Why did people still not trust Democrats as messengers? [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1360.6200000000001s)]
*  I think those are really important questions that Bernie Sanders is going to be very helpful in figuring out how to solve [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1364.66s)]
*  but I think to say carte blanche Democrats abandoned working people is I think to [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1369.78s)]
*  embrace a [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1376.18s)]
*  part a reality of our politics and the influence of money of our politics and in part to embrace a Republican critique and [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1377.66s)]
*  Republican vibes and I just think those things need to be separated out [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1384.18s)]
*  Yeah, I feel Bernie's like rage here and he's got some fair points and his analysis of votes [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1388.1399999999999s)]
*  We're losing is absolutely right [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1393.6399999999999s)]
*  But I think the harder thing to reckon with is the fact that Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden work together to pass [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1394.82s)]
*  COVID relief money cap the price of insulin they passed the child tax credit while Republicans voted against all of those things [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1399.54s)]
*  The Biden administration was great on antitrust [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1406.1399999999999s)]
*  Then breaking up corporations Joe Biden fought for unions he went on the picket line and then [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1408.98s)]
*  Donald Trump campaigns with Elon Musk famous union buster and wins those working-class voters. And so the question is [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1415.1000000000001s)]
*  How does that disconnect? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1422.3400000000001s)]
*  Happen and how do we fix that politically because we're doing the right things [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1424.5800000000002s)]
*  Substantively not enough not enough and the messaging wasn't perfect, right? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1428.8200000000002s)]
*  Criticized the lack of economic messaging on the campaign before but we're not reaching the voters who needs to reach [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1432.8600000000001s)]
*  We've been dealing with this since the Obama years and I know President Obama thought [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1439.2600000000002s)]
*  Well, we just we should prove that democracy can deliver and if we deliver for people for working people [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1444.2600000000002s)]
*  Then they'll like the Democrats Joe Biden certainly had the same theory and I've thought that would be true as well [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1449.7s)]
*  Over the last several years and I do think that's one of the things we have to re-examine the idea that like if we deliver [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1456.76s)]
*  for working people [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1462.6s)]
*  economically, they will automatically [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1464.76s)]
*  You know start voting for Democrats because I think it's it's more complex than that [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1467.32s)]
*  The economy in politics is a cultural issue. We think of it in Democrats as a substantive issue [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1471.96s)]
*  What are the policies we can stitch together to prove to them that we will fight for them? [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1477.2s)]
*  But it's all vibes Donald Trump doesn't have a policy director. He has three policies about taxes [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1481.2s)]
*  That's it [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1485.76s)]
*  But he will of them would screw working people. Yeah. Yeah, I mean and [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1487.12s)]
*  But we're losing because the vibe that he gives off [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1491.6s)]
*  He is coming off as someone who was fighting for a certain set of people and we are not giving off that [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1494.04s)]
*  I think you can have a fair critique about [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1498.6399999999999s)]
*  Whether the Harris campaign used as much populist messaging as it perhaps it could [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1500.72s)]
*  Yeah, maybe that doesn't feel particularly natural to her. That's maybe that's not she's not Bernie. She's not Elizabeth Warren [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1504.96s)]
*  Yeah, she's not even Joe Biden like Scranton Joe era [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1510.32s)]
*  But there's a broader issue here is that we are approaching the issue wrong [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1514.24s)]
*  The last time we won an economic fight was in 2012 when that was that was a cultural war [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1518.08s)]
*  That was an identity issue culture war not we had better policies that supported that [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1523.6000000000001s)]
*  That's not really what it was about and just in case you think we're just simping for Obama here [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1527.88s)]
*  Like we get a lot of help because Mitt Romney was the opponent. Yeah [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1531.8s)]
*  You know and just seemed like a rich [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1535.72s)]
*  You know else is a not such rich guy [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1538.48s)]
*  Donald Trump you know, but how did culturally this is to your point? [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1540.36s)]
*  That's how culturally different did Donald Trump and Mitt Romney seem even though they're both rich guys, but it's worth but it's worth pointing out, right? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1543.8s)]
*  Barack Obama wins a throw-the-bums-out election [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1551.28s)]
*  He bet he he wins in 2012 against a plutocrat and running a campaign against the plutocrat, which is an exception to the rule [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1553.8799999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump wins a throw-the-bums-out election [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1561.04s)]
*  He loses his reelection when he's now the establishment then he wins another throw-the-bums-out election, right? [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1563.08s)]
*  And so I do think part like I want to I actually agree with everything that we're saying but I also like [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1568.72s)]
*  You know, there are Senate candidates that outperformed Donald Trump, right? There are there are signs here that we can point to that like [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1574.44s)]
*  part of this is the the the the the energy Donald Trump brings but part of it is also he got to just [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1581.88s)]
*  He is a he is a walking fuck you [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1587.48s)]
*  Hey, that is how he won in 2016 [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1590.5800000000002s)]
*  he built an even broader coalition of people who wanted to say fuck you this time and [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1592.98s)]
*  There's lessons we can learn from that [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1596.96s)]
*  But you also shouldn't I think over learn those lessons and it's a different fight when we're fighting [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1598.4s)]
*  As outsiders taking on an incumbent in a country that is extremely angry at the establishment [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1602.72s)]
*  One more point in this to Bernie's point that we've become the party of identity politics [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1608.52s)]
*  Rather than understanding the most people working class. It did make me think that after 2016 after Trump won it became this sort of like [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1612.28s)]
*  punchline and liberal spaces that [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1620.48s)]
*  Oh, it was economic anxiety because someone said oh some people voted for Trump because of economic anxiety [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1623.32s)]
*  and then you were mocked if you said that because [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1627.76s)]
*  Really? Everyone just voted for Trump because they were a racist or misogynist or misogynist and [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1630.32s)]
*  Like a couple things can be true [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1635.64s)]
*  there's like a lot of people who [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1638.4s)]
*  Are say racist things and misogynistic things and who voted for Donald Trump partly because they like that [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1641.04s)]
*  There's also people who just they voted they did have economic anxiety and voted for Donald Trump despite his racism and [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1646.44s)]
*  misogyny and [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1654.8000000000002s)]
*  I think that you know, that's one thing if we're gonna be introspective going forward is that like yeah [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1656.0s)]
*  There's some people who are just racist you do racist shit [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1662.44s)]
*  And then when we hear that we don't necessarily have to say well [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1664.74s)]
*  That means that everyone who voted for Donald Trump the economic anxiety thing was just bullshit [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1667.2s)]
*  That really wasn't that runs into a real that argument runs into a real problem when his largest gains were with Latinos [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1670.96s)]
*  Yeah, I just wanted one one just push back to Bernie though [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1675.68s)]
*  Like Kamala Harris did not play identity politics or highlight her identity at all on the campaign trail at all [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1679.08s)]
*  The opposite happened where Republicans called her a DEI hire [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1684.44s)]
*  So they played any politics in the most racist sexist way possible and the Democratic Party did not do that [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1688.2s)]
*  She went out of her way. I would say yeah [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1694.32s)]
*  Like that doesn't mean the Democratic Party writ large hasn't focused on identity as part of the coalition [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1696.8799999999999s)]
*  We'll get to this campaign yeah, we'll get to this when we I think we're gonna talk about it [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1701.92s)]
*  But like sometimes a lot of what people are directing at Kamala or at Democrats. They're directing actually at the commentary outs [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1705.7600000000002s)]
*  They're directing at which is directing at social media and it's so hard and infuriating because it's like we we can't control those people [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1712.2s)]
*  We've tried [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1719.6000000000001s)]
*  There's not a mute button at the DNC for all Democrats [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1721.4s)]
*  But you know, you know Tommy you talked about the effect of like organizing in field and like, you know [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1723.92s)]
*  Ben Wickler pointed out all the ways in which organizing Wisconsin [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1728.16s)]
*  Was what allowed them to be in a position to keep the Tammy Baldwin seat? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1731.88s)]
*  Despite the incredible national swing and I think there's like I want just like, you know [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1735.7600000000002s)]
*  I am NOT ready to say that organizing or field did not matter in this race [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1740.0800000000002s)]
*  But what I do want to figure out is Donald Trump didn't need it. He did something else, right? He did podcast [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1743.8400000000001s)]
*  He had had these [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1749.5200000000002s)]
*  Influencers behind him and like what is he doing instead of field that we should be doing too? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1752.0s)]
*  Well, that's a good segue the way that being online is now real life. Yeah [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1755.92s)]
*  Well, that's a good segue to we're gonna take through some of the other theories here and the first is Harry should have done more [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1760.3200000000002s)]
*  To meet voters where they are as they say [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1766.72s)]
*  Including but not limited to going on Joe Rogan and more broadly Democrats need to run the kind of candidate who can go on those [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1769.8400000000001s)]
*  Kinds of shows and mix it up. I think we're all in agreement there. Is anyone not in agreement? No, I [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1775.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I'm gonna I just think it's a little it's more complicated than she should have gone on [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1781.88s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I'm talking again. Sorry looking towards the future and forget about like nitpicking the past [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1787.0s)]
*  But like yes, I think in the future the whole conversation like why are you talking to this horrible person? [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1791.92s)]
*  You shouldn't be on the set with them that you're you're legitimizing them is like yeah [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1797.4s)]
*  also, there's been a few people saying like well, we need a Joe Rogan of the left and [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1802.0s)]
*  It like we were talking about this yesterday, which is like that's to me is quite stupid on two fronts [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1807.04s)]
*  One is like Joe Rogan wasn't built in some conservative lab [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1811.92s)]
*  He's a yes, Tommy was saying this yesterday [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1815.66s)]
*  Like he was a television host and a fear factor guy got into M&A started hosting this show [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1817.66s)]
*  And had built an audience and then people went to that audience. The second problem with that is [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1822.3000000000002s)]
*  If there was a Joe Rogan on the left that appealed to the kind of people Joe Rogan appeal to [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1827.42s)]
*  He would be vilified by people on the left for all of his heterodoxies and ways in which he annoys them [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1831.9s)]
*  It is very annoying and terrible that Joe Rogan is anti-vax [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1837.5800000000002s)]
*  He has stupid views on a lot of issues that I don't agree with but [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1841.2s)]
*  Joe Rogan was somebody that had had Bernie Sanders on when Joe we Dan you said this yesterday [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1846.28s)]
*  What when Bernie Sanders put out that Joe Rogan endorsed him people fucking went after him? [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1850.64s)]
*  For that and you know what people are right to find Joe Joe Rogan's noxious views noxious totally [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1856.3600000000001s)]
*  But I think we should be honest about the ways in which we've kind of pushed like there's there's this conservative [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1862.56s)]
*  Media ecosystem that is directly partisan [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1868.64s)]
*  Right-wing conservative covers politics every day, but now around it. There is this collection of comedians [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1871.48s)]
*  entertainers influences influencers who are not political [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1879.52s)]
*  But feel much more comfortable on the right than they feel on the left [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1882.88s)]
*  And so I am less interested in should Kamala Harris go on Joe Rogan or should we have a Joe Rogan in the left and more? [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1886.26s)]
*  Thinking a how do we build the progressive version? [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1892.4s)]
*  We're trying to do that here at crooked [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1897.0s)]
*  But we need help of that kind of partisan infrastructure and then how do we make those non-political? [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1898.58s)]
*  Hosts that have huge followings feel as welcome in our world and we as welcome in their world as they can now currently feel [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1906.92s)]
*  On the right without giving up on our values being honest about where we disagree [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1913.72s)]
*  But being willing to go there and those people feeling comfortable with us [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1917.84s)]
*  Yeah, I think that love it handled the infrastructure piece of this and I talked about it [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1922.12s)]
*  Last episode but I think it's Rogan sort of become a proxy for a broader conversation about like should Kamala Harris have let [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1927.04s)]
*  Her rip a little bit, you know, I mean like should should Joe should she gone on Joe Rogan? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1932.46s)]
*  Arguably the biggest media platform in the country. Yes, obviously she should have but the if you watched Trump's three hour [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1937.36s)]
*  Rambling mess of an interview [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1943.84s)]
*  We know we all had the kind of a Rorsak test about what was our takeaway and I think the takeaway for a lot [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1945.44s)]
*  Of people was he didn't sound like a politician, you know, we made fun of him saying he does the weave [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1950.28s)]
*  We called it being a rambling incoherent old man, he thought he did pretty well [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1954.52s)]
*  Well, yeah, but like, you know, so I think that's the question is like should [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1958.08s)]
*  Democrats have to find ways to communicate to people where they don't sound like they're reading a script or talking points because that was [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1962.64s)]
*  The narrative you started to hear a lot about Kamala Harris. There's a lot of ticktocks where people ask [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1968.2s)]
*  Hey, like Bruce, what do you want for dinner? [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1973.14s)]
*  It's like well [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1975.2s)]
*  I grew up in a working-class family with a four-micah table or people were that was kind of a meme that people were making [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1975.72s)]
*  Fun of her because she was so on message [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1980.16s)]
*  Charlemagne asked her about this directly she gave [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1982.52s)]
*  Well, it wasn't great we don't know I mean she gave an answer that you worked in the moment [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1986.2s)]
*  but maybe it was a [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1990.02s)]
*  Sign about a broader challenge that was never addressed. There are two separate issues here one [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1991.96s)]
*  There is what we say and how we say right there's what we say the words come out of our mouth and [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=1996.22s)]
*  As we talked about in our last podcast, which feels like seven years ago, but was yesterday that [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2000.44s)]
*  Democrats not too much like politicians and that's that is not that's not Kamala Harris herself [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2005.52s)]
*  Everyone and also like 90% of Republicans too. Yeah, exactly. Just I mean JD Vance sounds terrible [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2009.84s)]
*  He's bad in these forums. The second issue is how we get people to hear what we're saying and that's what we are failing [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2015.44s)]
*  Dramatically as a party we have not yet figured out how to get our message in front of voters who do not consume [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2021.1599999999999s)]
*  News as a hobby and you can see that in part in the giant gap between how Kamala Harris in the battleground states [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2028.32s)]
*  Where we spent several billion dollars to communicate [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2036.2s)]
*  To those voters and where we didn't yeah, right lost six points nationally three points in the battleground states [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2039.9199999999998s)]
*  And that's because those people they are consuming some information, but they are not getting our side of the story [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2045.44s)]
*  We do not have a capacity as a party to tell our story on our terms to our voters [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2050.32s)]
*  And that is we don't fix that problem [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2054.92s)]
*  None of the other things are gonna matter we can have a thousand messaging discussions [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2057.36s)]
*  About how to talk about the economy or how we sound more like a human as has been your hobby horse for 20 years [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2060.52s)]
*  And it won't matter because no one will fucking hear it [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2065.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, we could spend another billion dollars in ads and you know battle to a close to a couple points down [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2067.28s)]
*  Well or or just that we like we were talking about this before it recorded like all this that's fucking [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2073.4s)]
*  conversation about Tony Hinchcliffe's joke and the whatsapps about the Puerto Rican community vote coming out in droves like it didn't matter none of [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2078.5600000000004s)]
*  It was real and or maybe it was real in the maybe 30 or 40 percent of the country that was tangentially touching the campaign [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2084.7200000000003s)]
*  But that there's this vast tens of millions of people who are silent [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2091.44s)]
*  We are not talking to them and they are not talking to us and so we can run these campaigns [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2095.72s)]
*  And maybe they'll help at the margins, but those but winning or losing will be determined by the vibes in a place [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2100.12s)]
*  We don't reach yeah [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2104.9199999999996s)]
*  Alright another take this one's embodied by Wednesday's Brett Stevens column [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2106.9199999999996s)]
*  You know it's a good day at Pod Save America when we're going to Brett Stevens. It's been a while since we've done that I [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2111.12s)]
*  Will say Reid included this because he said he was getting some texts from friends about the Brett Stevens column and as he said [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2116.2799999999997s)]
*  I woke up and I had a text from text from my friend about the [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2121.8s)]
*  So [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2129.6s)]
*  Brett thinks that we're too annoying and elitist as a party that we focus too much on scolding voters into appreciating Joe Biden's economy and [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2131.1800000000003s)]
*  achievements [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2138.08s)]
*  We all talked about that yes agree there that we too quickly respond to even [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2139.04s)]
*  reasonable critiques of progressive ideas by labeling them racist or misogynist or transphobic and [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2143.6s)]
*  That by going so hard after Trump's crimes and trying to get him off ballots under the 14th amendment [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2148.32s)]
*  We ended up validating the narrative that we were using the levers of power against him [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2153.32s)]
*  Who wants to take any of that? [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2157.96s)]
*  I just must just note that he begins this column about how Democrats are kind of pedantic and [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2159.32s)]
*  Prigish with an anecdote about a jazz-era [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2164.4s)]
*  chessmaster [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2167.96s)]
*  Yeah, Brett Stevens is not he's not in touch with the [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2169.16s)]
*  The working folk or particularly self-aware [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2173.24s)]
*  But this is a man who tried to get a professor at a random college fired because that guy tweeted something mean [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2176.6s)]
*  It's yeah, I called him a bedbug so so maybe the best messenger in the interest of a good debate, right? [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2182.2599999999998s)]
*  Take Brett Stevens out of it. Let's just go with the message. I [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2187.68s)]
*  Hear you want I mean, yes, it is stupid to tell people the economy is great. What it is not [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2191.04s)]
*  Yes, it is stupid to demand that someone agree that Joe Biden is actually FDR if they don't feel that way [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2195.8799999999997s)]
*  Yes, it is stupid to [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2200.7999999999997s)]
*  scold someone who has different views but again, we're saying like it's exasperating because [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2202.72s)]
*  There's not a Democratic Party mute button where we can shut up all our annoying supporters [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2208.04s)]
*  He also talks about the prosecutions Kamala Harris and Joe Biden couldn't tell Merrick Gardin and who to prosecute or not [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2212.16s)]
*  They couldn't tell Alvin Bragg what to do. We couldn't tell prosecutors in Georgia what to do [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2218.24s)]
*  Yeah, did the prosecutions galvanize Republicans behind Donald Trump's candidacy and probably helped deliver him the primary? [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2222.6s)]
*  Yes, but no one's in charge of all of the Donald Trump broke the law [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2228.88s)]
*  Maybe people who break the law should be prosecuted for breaking the fucking law. Yeah, the idea that like, okay [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2232.0s)]
*  I would like to stipulate Democrats are annoying [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2237.98s)]
*  Correct present company included Democrats are annoying. However, the things that annoyed you personally aren't necessarily the reasons Donald Trump won [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2242.0800000000004s)]
*  No, I do not believe that the Colorado case about the 14th amendment is what drove turnout in Arizona in Nevada [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2249.88s)]
*  Give me a fucking I had forgotten that happened. I was forced to read this Brett Stevens column not a professional obligation [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2256.68s)]
*  But and what is also frustrating as we were saying is a lot of what annoys [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2261.44s)]
*  People like Brett Stevens and Elon Musk and all these people that are that are that are talking about talking about this kind of thing [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2265.96s)]
*  Is what they're they're not really talking about Democratic politicians. They're talking about Democratic activists. They're talking about shit [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2272.0s)]
*  They see online. It's it's if Twitter was gone [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2277.3799999999997s)]
*  Probably most of the people who piss off the Brett Stevens of the world they wouldn't like they wouldn't even hear their critiques [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2282.12s)]
*  But but it is like and the thing I like look there is a scolding right like and I think I think [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2288.8399999999997s)]
*  For those of us online [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2295.04s)]
*  Not the Democratic politicians when someone says something that you don't agree with or that you think is racist or sexist or transphobic [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2296.7599999999998s)]
*  One thing you have to think about is what does labeling that person? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2305.0s)]
*  Racist misogynist transphobic. What does it get you? What does it do? Right? Sometimes? It's just like well [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2309.36s)]
*  I did it because I'm I'm angry right so it's like that's fine [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2315.2s)]
*  But in terms of like building a political you could also say here's why that's wrong. Here's why I think that's wrong [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2318.12s)]
*  Here's why that was hurtful what you just said right though [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2324.2s)]
*  There was a like from 2017 to now the like check your privilege and do that [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2326.68s)]
*  Like it just doesn't it doesn't bring people in so it is the only point but but I would just say like though [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2331.18s)]
*  These are not the people running and losing elections these are just people on the internet and so to me it's like okay [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2337.84s)]
*  What is it? What is it? What does that say about like the Democratic apparatus and the kind of candidates? [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2342.4s)]
*  It's producing and I was thinking about this anecdote [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2347.2200000000003s)]
*  Which is that Hillary Clinton failed the bar the first time she took it? [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2350.1200000000003s)]
*  And it turned out that she had studied incredibly hard as she did for every test [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2354.04s)]
*  She's ever taken, but she had somehow I can't remember the details [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2358.1000000000004s)]
*  But she had studied for the wrong version of the bar the bar had changed and sometimes I feel like [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2360.6600000000003s)]
*  Democrats are [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2365.12s)]
*  front of the classroom kids [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2367.2s)]
*  studying really really hard for the wrong test and a lot of our candidates feel like front of the classroom kids and [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2369.04s)]
*  I think of Barack Obama who had a front of the classroom brain [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2374.88s)]
*  But back of the classroom vibes Trump is like that Bill Clinton is kind of like that something like Bernie Sanders is kind of like that [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2378.36s)]
*  these are really smart people who are a little bit annoyed and kind of throwing spitballs at the teacher and like [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2385.3s)]
*  That like the the Gretchen Whitmer has that vibe in Michigan and so like I just I am gonna try to be on guard [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2391.1200000000003s)]
*  Because it plays by the way, I'm a front of the classroom kid and like I like front of the class [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2397.84s)]
*  I was Elizabeth Warren voter because they built a they should have a shrine in the front of the classroom for Elizabeth Warren [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2402.28s)]
*  She's in front of the classroom person [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2407.2400000000002s)]
*  but [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2409.04s)]
*  Donald Trump is not that and he appeals to a lot of people and I think it part because of that and [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2410.44s)]
*  That that is my takeaway from Democrats are annoying. There's I think I think we're missing a point [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2415.52s)]
*  Here which is there are annoying Democrats. None of them have been our presidential nominees recently, right? They're not our Senate candidates [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2420.72s)]
*  Republicans are also annoying. They also have very intolerant views. They also respond to people in insane ways [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2428.66s)]
*  the Republicans have an apparatus that lifts up the worst of [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2434.56s)]
*  Democratic commentary whether it's a Twitter person a [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2439.2799999999997s)]
*  Random state senator from Maine or by the way now just fake [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2443.0s)]
*  That right they will they will make up something crazy that I left but it sounds like a leftist would say and then that this [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2447.36s)]
*  This is the power of libs of tick-tock. Yeah, right [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2454.08s)]
*  And this an entire apparatus Fox has been doing this for decades now to brand the Democrats in a way to bring it to make [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2456.68s)]
*  The caricature of Democrats seem real to lots of voters. We do not have a similar apparatus to do that about Republicans, right? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2462.2599999999998s)]
*  They're hope like you ever in our intro video for a while at our live shows [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2469.2799999999997s)]
*  We had that guy who used the example of Hitler who was a random state senator, I think [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2473.32s)]
*  Like use Hitler as an example of how you can make it from the streets to success [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2480.2000000000003s)]
*  Like if we had that Donald Trump said something he then he praised Hitler and then he became president. Yeah, what a country [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2484.84s)]
*  but there is there is no apparatus to make that guy incredibly famous and emblematic of [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2489.9s)]
*  Republicans and that's something that's one of the goes back to the other point about how we how we're losing the information warfare [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2495.48s)]
*  Trump Tucker Carlson some of the biggest voices in conservative media. They call Democrats demonic and unpatriotic. Yes [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2501.3599999999997s)]
*  It's insane and it just no one cares. Yeah, the anti Christ audiences [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2507.68s)]
*  Well, they called so they called them they think they're calling like Democratic politicians that you know [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2511.24s)]
*  And what happens is they try to say that we think of other voters [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2516.06s)]
*  No, they take like the American it's deplorable spout and garbage and but and again, but they're allowed to say like I mean imagine [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2520.48s)]
*  If like Elizabeth Warren went over like I was in Tennessee the other day [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2527.84s)]
*  What a fucking dump it is, but it wouldn't be seen as politically helpful [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2531.0s)]
*  But the Tucker Carlson rant against San Francisco as a place. Trump said Detroit was a shithole basically. I mean and again picked up votes [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2534.2200000000003s)]
*  Those people can say it and they won and we're losing so [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2542.8s)]
*  Well, yeah, so that's something to think about for us. This is why it's not fair [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2546.92s)]
*  Maybe the world is it is not fair, but maybe we should think about how to win [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2550.28s)]
*  But for sure, but also that's why I go back to like Kamala Harris saying we're all gonna be okay [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2552.76s)]
*  I don't know people in the market for that [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2556.62s)]
*  Is that what the leadership we need is right now? [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2558.0s)]
*  It seems like people want to want a little bit more anger and a little more antagonism and we can do that in a way [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2559.38s)]
*  That's we should yell at voters more. I'm not saying we should yell at voters. I'm not saying call them more racist [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2564.5s)]
*  That's not I know I know obviously I'm not what I'm saying, but I just there's a kind of it [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2569.3399999999997s)]
*  There's a there's an imperious [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2573.42s)]
*  Annoying. Yeah, so some good so are we everybody's some good points. Lastly, there's the take that it wasn't really about Trump at all [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2575.94s)]
*  it was about prices and the in the [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2583.2599999999998s)]
*  Global anti-incumbent mood we talked about this a little yesterday [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2585.6200000000003s)]
*  And we are in danger of over learning our lesson because MAGA only works for Trump [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2589.0600000000004s)]
*  What do you guys think? [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2594.3s)]
*  Yes, you mean the biggest factor is the political environment [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2596.94s)]
*  That supersedes every tactical strategic decision every that the Harris campaign made that the Trump campaign made [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2601.7400000000002s)]
*  The Trump Chris LaSavita and Suzy Wiles will be seen as geniuses because they won this race in the most favorable political environments [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2609.0200000000004s)]
*  Could possibly imagine and that's just how it works [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2614.46s)]
*  Yes, it's true that MAGA only works for Trump, but [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2617.34s)]
*  Reagan only worked for Reagan and then they won more one more election after that and [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2621.82s)]
*  the Reagan the coalition that Reagan built lasted for three presidential cycles and [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2626.1s)]
*  Bill Clinton kind of had to win with the Reagan coalition. It did not change again until 2008 [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2632.38s)]
*  so we had 28 years of basically the Reagan coalition working and [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2636.62s)]
*  This is the the urgency of our task is [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2640.5800000000004s)]
*  To make sure that the Trump coalition does not exist beyond this election [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2643.94s)]
*  And it's not a guarantee that that automatically falls by the wayside of Donald Trump's now the top of the ticket [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2648.82s)]
*  Yeah, I mean John Byrne Murdoch at the Financial Times at this chart for the first time since 1905 [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2654.1400000000003s)]
*  Every governing party facing an election in a developed country this year lost vote share [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2661.6200000000003s)]
*  First time that's happened since 1900 and that is like center-left party center-right far left whatever it is [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2668.3s)]
*  So it there was an anti-incumbent mood. I do think that like there's also been this rise of [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2674.54s)]
*  authoritarian movements all across the world and [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2680.62s)]
*  You can I think [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2684.9s)]
*  adequately blame inflation for sort of [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2687.14s)]
*  Accelerating that but it was also the the forces were there before the pandemic [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2690.86s)]
*  Causing this too, and I think one of the projects we have to figure out is like how we drain the appeal of [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2696.6200000000003s)]
*  autocratic regimes and demagogues [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2704.1400000000003s)]
*  so that people [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2706.42s)]
*  Who might feel economically stressed sort of like they've been left behind overlooked whatever it may be [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2708.34s)]
*  Actually, don't don't vote for them and then vote for you know pro-democracy candidates [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2716.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I was thinking about this too, and it's like you know [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2721.26s)]
*  A lot of people listening have been feeling this too. It's just like how did this happen? [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2723.34s)]
*  How is it even close doesn't make sense? [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2726.1800000000003s)]
*  I still can't make sense of it and I do think we'll also look back on this error and say [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2727.5s)]
*  That we went through a traumatic once in a once in a hundred year pandemic millions of people died [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2731.3s)]
*  It melt and meant it messed with all of our mental health and meant their sense of safety or sense of security or sense of [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2737.6600000000003s)]
*  The world and I think what we're talking about here is yeah, maybe it really is just anti-incumbency, right? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2743.6200000000003s)]
*  Maybe it really was just anger and inflation, but we got to make sure the door doesn't lock behind us [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2748.42s)]
*  Because that that's the risk here and I think even if it is true [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2752.7s)]
*  I think we should live as if it is not we should do everything we can to fight back as if this does represent [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2756.2599999999998s)]
*  a real kind of of a real change we have to figure out how to argue our way out of because [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2761.38s)]
*  of what it's I [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2768.38s)]
*  Think anti-incumbency is very real in the largest driving factor [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2770.18s)]
*  But I and I'm not suggesting you guys are doing this but I don't think we can let ourselves believe that that was all of it [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2774.2599999999998s)]
*  I do think Trump has a unique appeal in the Republican Party and he outran a lots of down-ballot Republicans and he's a noxious [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2779.34s)]
*  Person and in many ways the worst [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2787.5800000000004s)]
*  Candidate we all could imagine and somehow we did better than we thought and we need to sort of reckon with and understand that and then [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2789.98s)]
*  Also, there were discrete issues where voters were like [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2795.6600000000003s)]
*  Telling us for a year that they're mad about something and the Democratic Party refused to listen and my biggest hobby horse on this [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2799.6600000000003s)]
*  The war was raging for a year that Biden administration walked through the uncommitted vote process [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2806.02s)]
*  100,000 plus people voted uncommitted in the in the Democratic primary in Michigan and they didn't change a fucking thing [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2812.5s)]
*  about the policy and then the DNC comes around and [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2819.38s)]
*  No Palestinian is allowed to speak in Arab American Muslim American voters feel pushed out [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2822.86s)]
*  And then when you look at precincts in Dearborn Trump won Dearborn, Michigan with 42.8 percent Harris got 36 [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2827.3s)]
*  Jill Stein got 18. It's half Middle Eastern in 2020 Biden won almost 70 percent of the vote in Dearborn again [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2834.5s)]
*  I'm not suggesting those margins would have changed the outcome of the election. Obviously there are broader forces at play [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2842.06s)]
*  but when Democrats when voters are like we hate this thing you're doing and you keep doing it and what in what we're talking [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2847.58s)]
*  About here is outsourcing US foreign policy to BB Netanyahu [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2854.34s)]
*  One of the worst people on the planet besides Donald Trump like Trump of his country should listen to them [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2857.74s)]
*  We have like you can't just not course-correct in a situation like that [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2862.62s)]
*  I think we are also not fully analyzing the impact of Gaza when we limit it only to Michigan definitely because it's [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2866.5s)]
*  there are like 4% of voters in the exit poll said that [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2874.5s)]
*  Foreign policy was their top concern which to me I fight personally shockingly high [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2878.06s)]
*  But it's just the year-long impression of Democrats two young voters because of the Biden administration's approach to Gaza mattered [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2884.74s)]
*  I mean there's a gigantic shift among young girls strictly young men. Is it only Gaza? Of course not but it did become a [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2891.46s)]
*  Reason not to trust the party among voters. We need well, I will say too. It's not I mean just you know, we're all in [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2897.82s)]
*  support of the Ukraine against Putin's invasion here [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2904.78s)]
*  But when you look at polls and you'll see the focus groups what comes up even more often than Gaza is [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2908.34s)]
*  Like why are we sending money to Ukraine or Israel and Gaza right like it's it's all of it together [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2915.22s)]
*  So you have some people who? [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2921.4199999999996s)]
*  Like as I am are like I can't believe the fucking slaughter in Gaza is being allowed to continue right now [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2923.06s)]
*  but also like a lot of other people why are we saying so much money overseas and [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2928.5s)]
*  You know you can argue about how much we're sending and relative to this and that the other thing but like that's a that's a [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2932.66s)]
*  Message that broke through. All right. So did we fix everything? I [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2937.1s)]
*  Think so any other any other takes on how to get out at the top do it for [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0O3-DOkFMM&t=2940.82s)]
