Video Description: The Trump administration promised to release the Epstein Files, but ended up disappointing MAGA die-hards instead. Can Elon do what the DOJ couldn't? In more important news, Trump and Musk continue shredding the government, with the NIH and FDA among the latest targets. House Republicans pass their "big, beautiful bill" and swear they won't touch Medicaid to pay for their tax cuts—but the math doesn't add up. Jeff Bezos makes a drastic change to The Washington Post's Opinion section. Meanwhile, Trump posts a deranged, AI-generated video of his vision for Gaza's future and announces a new oligarch-friendly immigration policy. Jon and Dan discuss the latest cuts and chaos, and how Democrats can use their limited leverage with a government shutdown approaching. Then, Jen Psaki joins the hosts to talk about the White House's press and communications strategy in a special preview of our subscriber-only show, Inside 2025.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Donald Trump Is Being Dragged Down by Elon Musk's Chaotic Mess At DOGE
**Pod Save America:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc)
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Jon Favreau. I'm Dan Pfeiffer. Dan nice to have you in LA in studio [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=0.0s)]
*  Oh love that great. We're gonna have a good time today. No, we're not [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=5.4s)]
*  Terrible, I know we're gonna talk about it [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=10.36s)]
*  No [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=11.88s)]
*  We're gonna talk about Republicans in Congress moving forward with the Trump economic plan [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=12.6s)]
*  Which among other things would take away health care and food from kids in order to fund a huge tax cut for the 1% [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=17.28s)]
*  So that's lovely [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=22.84s)]
*  Democrats are also gonna have to decide whether to use the limited leverage they have in the government shutdown fight [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  That's rapidly approaching. We'll get to that [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=28.84s)]
*  We're also gonna cover Jeff Bezos's decision to turn the Washington Post editorial page into the Wall Street Journal [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=31.44s)]
*  Then we're back with our latest installment of wait. Did that really happen? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=37.36s)]
*  Where we where we'll react to this week's most insane moments [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=41.24s)]
*  It was a stiff competition, but we think we found the three. I'm sure everyone remembers the one time we did that segment [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=44.72s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's back. Okay, it's back repetition. It's key [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=51.44s)]
*  And stick around later for a sneak preview of the excellent conversation that Dan and I just had earlier in the week with our [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=54.68s)]
*  Pal Jen Psaki about White House press and communication strategy [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=60.0s)]
*  That's on our subscriber only show inside 2025 [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=64.44s)]
*  But you get a sneak preview here. So lucky you yeah [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=68.0s)]
*  All right [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=73.12s)]
*  But first Donald Trump kicked off the first cabinet meeting of a second term with a special presentation [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  From the most powerful member of his administration or any administration [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=78.72s)]
*  Special government employee Elon Musk who showed up in his trademark [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=82.92s)]
*  Dark MAGA hat and tech support t-shirt to reassure everyone that Doge is in a complete clusterfuck [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=86.75999999999999s)]
*  And we and I should say we will also we will make mistakes [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=93.24s)]
*  But when we make mistakes we'll fix it very quickly [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=97.6s)]
*  So for example with USAID [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=102.0s)]
*  One of the things we accidentally canceled very briefly was Ebola [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=104.88s)]
*  Prevention I think we all want the ball of prevention. So we restore the ball of prevention immediately and there was no interruption [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=109.0s)]
*  So unfortunately for those of us who aren't keen on getting Ebola [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=115.92s)]
*  What Elon said there is not true [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=121.16s)]
*  Jeremy Kanondike who led Ebola response at USAID under both Obama and Trump said the US government's capacity to respond has quote been wrecked [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=123.84s)]
*  Right as there's an Ebola outbreak happening in East Africa as we speak [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=131.8s)]
*  That's not all Kanondike also says Doge has crippled the CDC [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=135.88s)]
*  Also, the FDA this week just canceled their annual meeting to discuss next year's flu vaccines with no explanation [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=140.48s)]
*  Catherine Wu reports in the Atlantic that the NIH is still [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=149.28s)]
*  violating court orders by refusing to restart most medical research and the person now in charge of the nation's health [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=153.8s)]
*  HHS secretary RFK jr. Said during the cabinet meeting that the measles outbreak in Texas that has now killed a child is quote [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=160.54s)]
*  Not unusual. In fact, it is unusual [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=167.94s)]
*  It's quite not died measles in the United States for quite some time quite some time [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=170.82s)]
*  Is this maha are we maha now is this have we have we maha? I don't know how to say it [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=175.34s)]
*  It really I think the question of whether we've maha or not depends on how you define the word healthy [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=181.26s)]
*  Yeah, because if you define it in its traditional sense then no we are not headed towards healthy [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=186.34s)]
*  We're headed in the opposite direction and there's so much to say here [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=190.66s)]
*  But just on the Ebola thing just an example of what an absolute chaotic cluster fuck that Trump administration is [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=193.66s)]
*  Said any ball in Uganda where they are they've been dealing with this Ebola outbreak [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=199.06s)]
*  They were in need of more protective gear because there's been one patient who had gone to six different facilities [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=204.5s)]
*  Uh-huh, and there's six different clinics and so they needed gear there to protect the workers there [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=210.66s)]
*  We could not access the gear because it was in a who warehouse and because we you were not allowed to speak to who [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=216.42s)]
*  That's according to report in the New York Times. You're not allowed to speak to who within the Trump administration [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=223.7s)]
*  So it just sat there then they tried to buy hold out of the who the World Health Organization [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=227.62s)]
*  Well now the World Health Organization now we're not communicating with them at all [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=231.94s)]
*  Even though it's the World Health Organization and they could use the the only world the only superpower in the world to help and they had [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=234.42s)]
*  protective [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=241.57999999999998s)]
*  Gear that we had paid for so then they had to do a contract to get more protective gear [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=243.14s)]
*  So we're not saving money. We're not doing anything, right? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=247.45999999999998s)]
*  We're just making things worse [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=249.82s)]
*  so much of the USA ID cluster fuck has not been about saving money because and I and I [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=251.29999999999998s)]
*  Can't emphasize this enough because people well [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=256.86s)]
*  Voters don't like foreign aid and they want to spend money on other stuff and some of it was wasteful and blah blah [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=259.5s)]
*  No, there was money that was appropriated already. We're not getting it back spent on you know [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=263.78s)]
*  500 million dollars in food that's just like sitting in Doc's spoiling right now like [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=270.53999999999996s)]
*  Malaria nets that were already purchased like this stuff was all right [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=275.97999999999996s)]
*  The money has already been spent in a lot of these cases and it's just now the life-saving food and medicine just isn't getting to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=279.06s)]
*  People because they're all fucking assholes and competent assholes run in the country [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=286.06s)]
*  It's truly insane [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=290.62s)]
*  you have to be both dumb and lacking in even a single iota of empathy within your body to [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=291.94s)]
*  Run the government like this. So you are you saying that they're not showing competence and caring. I'm there [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=297.65999999999997s)]
*  That's what Elon said he goes competence and caring. That's what we're all about. There is no competence and caring and [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=303.29999999999995s)]
*  Like you make the point that you know [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=308.78s)]
*  The conventional wisdom is people don't care about foreign aid. It's always it's always top of the list [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=311.02s)]
*  Yes people where should we save money the government was a farted [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=315.9s)]
*  If you ask me anything else, they don't they want to keep the military many people do never touch those security Medicare [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=318.62s)]
*  Education funding whatever else it is [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=324.7s)]
*  But I think one you can and should make the case here for what is happening because it's not [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=326.18s)]
*  About whether you should spend that money or not even you should you can make a case for why you should spend it why? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=332.26s)]
*  It's good for our security particularly when it comes something like a bullet permission. We help prevent [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=336.26s)]
*  Pandemics and epidemics in other countries so they don't come here. Yes [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=340.54s)]
*  it's exactly what we are doing and if you don't control them at the [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=343.54s)]
*  Root of the cause of the pandemic then it comes it spreads everywhere [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=347.42s)]
*  Then an epidemic comes the pandemic and we are back to right where we were before [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=351.22s)]
*  But also it's the NIH the NIH stuff is particularly notable in every funding fight in [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=354.62s)]
*  History between Republicans and Democrats Republicans are trying to cut funding the place where they always lose the public is on [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=361.1s)]
*  food safety drug safety [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=368.22s)]
*  research in diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's and [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=370.98s)]
*  That is what's happening here in particularly if you leave the disease research [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=373.70000000000005s)]
*  You know, we think we talked about this couple weeks ago there have been major breakthroughs in Alzheimer's research [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=377.74s)]
*  Yep, there's real momentum there. Just this week. There was an announcement that about real progress with a [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=381.78s)]
*  Treatment for pancreatic cancer using an mRNA vaccine [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=388.09999999999997s)]
*  Technology all there's huge momentum here and all that's gonna stop in its tracks if we we back away from this [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=391.7s)]
*  Which is exactly what Elon and Trump are doing [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=397.21999999999997s)]
*  So the NIH has helped fund 99% of the drugs that are approved in the last decade [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=399.5s)]
*  Catherine was story in the Atlantic. Everyone should go read it. It will infuriate you [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=404.82s)]
*  basically, they try to freeze a bunch of NIH funding and then they go to court and [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=409.41999999999996s)]
*  the court says no, you can't freeze it you got to restart and [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=415.38s)]
*  people at the NIH want to start approving grants again because everything had been frozen and then [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=419.29999999999995s)]
*  HHS the political appointees at HHS from the Health and Human Services [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=425.65999999999997s)]
*  This is before our cage in your gut there [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=430.46s)]
*  They said to the NIH no, you can't restart the the grants and then the lawyers at HHS and the lawyers at NIH was like [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=432.78s)]
*  No, we have to we are in violation of a court order and the political appointees at HHS said no [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=440.78s)]
*  You don't do it. And so there's been this like weeks weeks long thing now where [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=446.78s)]
*  here and there some grants are like getting approved because people are just like sort of just doing their own thing but [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=451.78s)]
*  Everyone who works in the building is just like they are demoralized a lot of these grants aren't going anywhere [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=458.66s)]
*  There are in some cases there are critically ill patients enrolled in drug trials that cannot continue because of this [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=465.14s)]
*  I mean again, this is just this isn't saving money. This isn't making government more efficient [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=472.08s)]
*  This is just fucking ruining people's lives and like denying us potential treatments and cures that [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=476.54s)]
*  We've already paid for our tax dollars have already paid for it's fucking nuts, man [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=483.22s)]
*  It's nuts and you know, sadly the doge chaos continues apace across the entire federal government [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=488.0s)]
*  Would refer I would refer you to this AP headline from Wednesday evening [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=495.34000000000003s)]
*  VA pauses billions in cuts lauded by Musk as lawmakers and veterans veterans decry loss of critical care [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=498.9s)]

*  Veterans with disabilities getting fired left and right VA hospitals [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=510.66s)]
*  At the cabinet meeting Trump touched off a fresh panic by saying that EPA administrator [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=515.94s)]
*  Lee Zeldin is planning to cut 65% of the agency's workforce only to have the White House clarify later in the day that he [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=520.7s)]
*  Meant EPA is going to cut 65% of its spending not 65% of its staff [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=527.1800000000001s)]
*  Still bad not good if you like clean air and clean water, right? Yeah [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=532.14s)]
*  Then there's the fact [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=536.5s)]
*  That Elon and Doge have cut about 400 jobs from the Federal Aviation Administration [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=538.3s)]
*  Only to have Elon tweet on Thursday quote [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=545.02s)]
*  There is a shortage of top-notch air traffic controllers if you have retired but are open to returning to work [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=548.54s)]
*  Please consider doing so is that where we're recruiting now air traffic controllers just who have Twitter on Twitter. Yeah, that's where we are [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=555.62s)]
*  Yeah, that's where we are [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=563.1s)]
*  I don't know seems like there's downsides to the move fast break things approach [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=566.3000000000001s)]
*  From Elon and the doge bags and the Silicon Valley types [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=571.98s)]
*  Yeah, it seems that way the let's stipulate that [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=576.0600000000001s)]
*  government [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=580.62s)]
*  Can and should be made more efficient more cost-effective that there's possible that there are places where there are too many people [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=581.6600000000001s)]
*  Doing not not the right things like that is absolutely 100% true [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=590.0600000000001s)]
*  But what Elon Musk and Donald Trump are trying to do here is not fix government [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=593.94s)]
*  They're not trying to reform it not trying to make it more efficient [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=597.62s)]
*  They're trying to break it to absolutely destroy the idea of a federal government [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=599.82s)]
*  That whose job it is to help people to protect them to protect people to keep them secure and safe [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=606.14s)]
*  They do not believe in that and they're trying to destroy it and what that means is and they have they have made a bet here [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=611.96s)]
*  Because of their actions [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=617.48s)]
*  We are less safe less secure. We're at greater risk of plane crashes [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=619.5600000000001s)]
*  Disease epidemics pollution in our air and water [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=626.72s)]
*  foodborne pathogens [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=630.6800000000001s)]
*  dangerous drugs all those things are there and we have the point here is that [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=632.76s)]
*  Donald Trump is responsible for everything everything that happens from this point forward. He broke government [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=638.08s)]
*  Consequences for that right that could be a plane crash as serious something as serious and dramatic as a plane crash [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=643.64s)]
*  It could be very not unrelated to this measles epidemic that is taking place in Texas [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=648.64s)]
*  Where we now have a we fired a lot of the people in charge of managing those things [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=653.2800000000001s)]
*  Yep, and we have as the HHS secretary a vaccine skeptic [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=658.0s)]
*  There in a president frankly [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=662.8000000000001s)]
*  He was a vaccine skeptic on to some degree and that canceled meeting with the FDA was supposed to figure out the flu vaccine [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=664.64s)]
*  Like they don't have a lot of time before they have to start production of next year's flu vaccine [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=669.7199999999999s)]
*  So like no one knows why it was canceled [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=675.3599999999999s)]
*  No one knows when it's gonna be rescheduled and they're almost out of time to figure out next year's flu vaccines [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=677.4799999999999s)]
*  And we've now had the worst year for flu that we've had in decades [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=682.68s)]
*  It is [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=687.4s)]
*  There is there are consequences these actions they have to be held accountable for these actions [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=688.68s)]
*  And that is that like I said that can be as serious as things I mentioned also [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=692.4399999999999s)]
*  When you try to run the Social Security Administration with half the staff [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=695.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, payments are going to be missed right? They keep talking about how they're going to they're cracking down on fraud [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=699.0s)]
*  You know what's one way to have there be more fraud to cut staff at the [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=704.78s)]
*  Social Security Administration or the IRS or those other places and [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=708.96s)]
*  This just I just cannot obsess enough is that every single thing the Republicans held Joe Biden [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=712.2s)]
*  Responsible for a million things that were nowhere near him, right? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=717.84s)]
*  Remember when everyone was supposed to be mad at Joe Biden because you couldn't find a turkey on Thanksgiving because of supply chain [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=720.92s)]
*  Shortages that you were gonna go to Target and there'd be no Christmas presents or holiday presents for anyone and [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=726.62s)]
*  We have to hold Trump to the to a same center, but we actually have a basis in fact for that [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=731.78s)]
*  You he promised stability he promised security [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=735.82s)]
*  He's doing everything to create the opposite of that and he has to be held accountable [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=738.42s)]
*  this is also a direct result of [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=741.98s)]
*  Elon trying to run the government like he runs one of his companies and [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=745.74s)]
*  You know, everyone's like oh well, he did this at Twitter and then he made Twitter in some people's [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=751.18s)]
*  opinion work better or whatever but like if you cut a bunch of staff fire a bunch of people at a company and [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=756.3s)]
*  It degrades some services for a while, but eventually it becomes better run more efficient [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=763.8199999999999s)]
*  Whatever it like if Twitter if he took over Twitter fired a bunch of people and Twitter went down for a while [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=770.9399999999999s)]
*  Okay, like that's not great. Maha. That would be my heart. That would be my heart, right? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=775.22s)]
*  Yeah [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=779.3s)]
*  if [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=779.9s)]
*  you know [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=780.5s)]
*  he's at SpaceX and they have to delay the launch of a rocket because they fucked something up because they didn't have the [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=781.1s)]
*  Right people whatever right? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=785.78s)]
*  with the federal government [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=787.98s)]
*  they are breaking everything firing all these people gutting all these services and [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=789.5799999999999s)]
*  Like say they make it more efficient and better run years down the road [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=793.86s)]
*  Like millions of people's lives are at stake right now [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=798.74s)]
*  And that is the difference between running the fucking federal government and running a business [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=801.8199999999999s)]
*  And he also doesn't run Tesla and SpaceX like he runs Twitter, right? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=805.86s)]
*  Because there are stakes with nothing like the federal government six, but there's you know, yes [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=809.8199999999999s)]
*  You may have to delay a launch but you could also have an explosion, right? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=813.74s)]
*  So you can you know [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=817.66s)]
*  If there is a problem with Tesla cars and they like the self-driving software like that offices comes goes [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=818.98s)]
*  But Twitter is the example. I won't keep using it's like who gives a flying fuck if Twitter goes down for a minute, right? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=824.06s)]
*  And you know, it's so low stakes. It's like the sixth most important social media platform in this country [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=830.9399999999999s)]
*  And by the way, Dean is ten times more pop more important than but then Twitter and it is worse [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=836.9399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, right. Yeah, it's like spammy ads bullshit like come on [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=841.66s)]
*  Speaking of Elon in the FAA because this is one I'm following closely [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=846.58s)]
*  He's all right. I [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=850.94s)]
*  Will say you were as Dan was flying here yesterday [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=853.58s)]
*  I was like sending a story about the near miss and you were sending a video of a near miss as I was born [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=857.0600000000001s)]
*  I didn't know you were on the plane obviously [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=862.34s)]
*  But it's it's somewhat comforting in this time to know that other people who have not been afraid of flying their whole lives [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=864.38s)]
*  Like you are now nervous as well. I can still do the math, but yeah, no, I know [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=870.06s)]
*  so [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=876.3s)]
*  He's forcing the FAA now [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=877.8199999999999s)]
*  to withdraw a contract they gave to Verizon to modernize communication inside the [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=880.7399999999999s)]
*  Air-traffic control system and to hire Musk's own company Starlink to do it instead [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=887.3399999999999s)]
*  Now Elon tweeted on Thursday that Verizon's existing system is on the brink of a catastrophic breakdown [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=892.8199999999999s)]
*  Which is comforting he said we're single digit months away from a catastrophic breakdown [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=900.26s)]
*  It's like oh is someone from the fucking FAA gonna tell us that or do we just have to take the word of? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=905.8199999999999s)]
*  The ketamine addled fucking billionaire who's running the government that by the way [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=912.6199999999999s)]
*  If we don't put in Starlink air traffic control is gonna have a catastrophic meltdown is like is that what we're left to do to [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=918.5999999999999s)]
*  Figure out whether we should fly or not [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=924.56s)]
*  Like if someone at the FAA gonna come give a press conference tell us about their fucking air traffic control [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=926.38s)]
*  Communication system or no, it's just Elon tweeted [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=931.3000000000001s)]
*  I would just note that [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=933.4200000000001s)]
*  My bag is packed on the couch in your office and the second we finished record this I'm going to leave this studio and go [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=935.46s)]
*  Get on airplane to fly home. Well, luckily he said it's we're a couple months. Well, look right here [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=941.0600000000001s)]
*  I'm really leaning into the definition of word brink [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=945.58s)]
*  And so and he said, you know this now he tweeted this in response to this story about [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=948.98s)]
*  Elon trying to push them to cancel the Verizon contract so they could do Starlink and he said well no [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=954.86s)]
*  No, it's the Verizon things on the brink of catastrophic breakdown and I'm providing Starlink units at no cost to the taxpayer for now [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=960.0600000000001s)]
*  then [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=968.1800000000001s)]
*  It's an update for you. Just before we recorded he corrected himself and said actually the existing system [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=969.22s)]
*  That's on the verge of a catastrophic breakdown isn't Verizon's. It's an old it's another company the new system [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=975.9s)]
*  That's not yet operational is Verizon [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=982.5s)]
*  But now we're canceling in that and giving Starlink the contract instead [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=985.02s)]
*  The funny thing is is I knew this from the beginning [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=988.66s)]
*  I mean and I'm not even in charge of doge because you just read the words in the article [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=990.98s)]
*  It's very clear. The Verizon is the new system [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=995.9s)]
*  Unfucking believable and this isn't the only government contract Starlink could be getting the Biden era [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=998.54s)]
*  broadband equity access and deployment program god terrible fucking name bead [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1005.1s)]
*  You know what some of this shit I'm like this is why this is why we're doing this is why doge exists this is not right [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1010.3s)]
*  It passed as part of the infrastructure bill. He could have just said broadband. We're doing broadband [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1014.9s)]
*  Anyway, they set aside more than 40 billion to improve broadband in rural areas by growing the fiber optic network [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1019.86s)]
*  Didn't really happen that well again [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1026.1399999999999s)]
*  That's another problem for Democrats to think about next time if we ever want to be in power again, but Elon surprise surprise [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1027.86s)]
*  Thinks that it should be satellite internet instead and that Starlink should should should run this [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1033.62s)]
*  I am shocked to find that out. So [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1038.46s)]
*  Stipulating Starlink might be great to use it might be the right solution for all of our [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1041.46s)]
*  connectivity challenges for air traffic control who knows [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1046.66s)]
*  Still feels like a major conflict of interest at best that we're not having [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1050.3400000000001s)]
*  Companies bid for these contracts. We're just gonna have the guy that's running [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1055.3400000000001s)]
*  This that's single-handedly cutting government firing people his companies get the contracts. It's a coincidence [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1059.94s)]
*  It's a coincidence it's hard to imagine how that happened feels like Democrats should make some noise about this now [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1065.62s)]
*  What do you think? I think Elon Musk is Donald Trump's political Achilles heel. Yeah, he is [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1071.02s)]
*  We've seen this in polling and in focus groups that [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1076.62s)]
*  Peter Hammy wrote about in puck news the other day [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1079.8999999999999s)]
*  Voters are they don't trust Elon Musk. I think he's a tool. One of them said Trump voters say he was a tool [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1082.74s)]
*  that Trump voter [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1088.86s)]
*  That's a better at a point that but they don't they don't trust them they don't [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1091.62s)]
*  Like him running around unilaterally slashing government. They don't like the idea of the world's richest man [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1096.58s)]
*  Rooting through government. They think he is filled with conflicts of interest [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1101.9399999999998s)]
*  They don't think he's doing particularly good job in that Washington Post poll only 34% of people approved of [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1104.9799999999998s)]
*  How Elon Musk was doing his job in government? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1109.58s)]
*  And so we should talk about it all the time in this conflict of interest there [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1112.4199999999998s)]
*  I think this is really important because this is something I'm gonna I will flesh it [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1115.74s)]
*  Before about I'm gonna will one day flush this out is an actual written argument [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1119.6799999999998s)]
*  but my belief is that the narrative the Democrats should tell about the Trump administration is one of chaos and corruption and [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1124.1599999999999s)]
*  Nothing embodies that more than Elon Musk and doge. This is incredibly funny because you've talked about chaos and corruption [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1130.8799999999999s)]
*  Before this election I talked about the last election. You love you love chaos and corruption. Well with Trump [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1137.7199999999998s)]
*  But I was gonna say you were you were ahead of your time really because if you thought that was chaos and corruption before [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1143.32s)]
*  Elon Musk yes, I had the my problem is Donald Trump keeps becoming president [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1148.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's true [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1154.04s)]
*  I mean we've done this podcast or a version of this podcast for three consecutive presidential elections and Donald Trump's been in all of them [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1155.12s)]
*  So chaos and corruption keep coming up. I don't know why [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1160.7s)]
*  Well, the Democrats are sort of figuring this out I guess Hakeem Jeffries did a press conference today, I think Thursday [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1165.08s)]
*  Where he mentioned that Elon Musk is making eight million dollars a day in government contracts [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1172.12s)]
*  And the average person on Medicaid making makes $65 a day [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1178.0s)]
*  Because they're looking to cut Medicaid in the budget at least if you were gonna get to if you leave at least if you believe [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1182.88s)]
*  the budget instructions [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1187.6000000000001s)]
*  So yeah, I do think that's that's relevant that Elon Musk is making eight million dollars a day in government contracts and once more [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1189.0400000000002s)]
*  And once more while he's trying to slash government because he says it's wasteful and inefficient [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1194.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's something to look into maybe something to talk about [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1198.94s)]
*  And believe it or not even bigger doge cuts are coming [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1202.3200000000002s)]
*  Just one example the Washington Post reports that the as you said the Social Security [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1205.06s)]
*  Administration has been told to start getting ready to cut its staff by half [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1208.94s)]
*  Of course cuts like this have already happened at places like USAID that we mentioned in a court filing [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1213.26s)]
*  the administration detailed this week that they have canceled more than 90% of [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1218.06s)]
*  USAID's foreign assistance contracts or about 16 billion dollars in foreign aid across the government a federal court had ruled the government [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1223.6200000000001s)]
*  Needed to pay out assistance money that was already obligated by Wednesday at midnight [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1231.4599999999998s)]
*  But a few hours before the deadline the Supreme Court stepped in and said the deadline shouldn't be enforced [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1236.3s)]
*  Meaning the foreign aid freeze can stand for now. So this was a the SCOTUS ruling was pretty temporary and [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1240.98s)]
*  Narrow they basically, you know, there was a midnight deadline that said the government must pay and I think the court was like, okay [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1247.78s)]
*  We can skip the midnight midnight deadline until we have a broader [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1254.6999999999998s)]
*  Of this case and the parties have to respond by tomorrow with briefs to the Supreme Court [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1258.7s)]
*  Right, so, you know, I would not I would not call this a huge win for the Trump administration [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1263.46s)]
*  But I do wonder if we're seeing the limits of what the courts might be willing or able [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1268.14s)]
*  to do to stop these guys from just destroying whatever they want and I think back to the [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1272.9s)]
*  NIH example that we just talked about where you know, there's even the lawyers even the Trump administration lawyers in the agencies [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1277.14s)]
*  They're like, yeah [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1284.02s)]
*  I think we should follow the court orders and then some other jackoffs are like now fuck it [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1284.58s)]
*  I mean, this is the test right? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1288.1s)]
*  This is the ultimate test of the system is the idea of the Supreme Court of as a or the judicial branch is a co-equal branch [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1290.3s)]
*  of government is [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1297.6599999999999s)]
*  Really just a theoretical concept that exists only through the acquiescence of the executive branch [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1300.02s)]
*  Yeah, because the people who enforce court orders work for the executive branch [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1305.42s)]
*  Yeah, and so this is the test and there's real speculation that John Roberts is going to try as hard as he can to avoid [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1309.52s)]
*  testing this proposition away that would have Trump violate with impunity the [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1317.52s)]
*  Order from the court as JD Vance has encouraged him to do right [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1323.68s)]
*  Because once that happens the idea of judicial review the [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1327.92s)]
*  Findings in these the main Supreme Court case that you learned in the first day of all common law classes Marbury versus Madison [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1331.52s)]
*  Falls apart. Yeah, because what once once [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1337.8999999999999s)]
*  You say do this or else and they say no and there's no or else the whole system collapses [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1341.1399999999999s)]
*  And so this is like a very serious [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1347.78s)]
*  Situation you can really see John Roberts who's tried really hard to ruin the court slowly [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1350.2199999999998s)]
*  to sort of avoid an epic confrontation that is going to be Trump to Trump's benefit as [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1356.2199999999998s)]
*  These cases proceed through the through the process and I will say for being totally fair [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1362.06s)]
*  I don't know why we have to be but Trump has said he would follow court orders [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1367.1s)]
*  Well, that brings up another scenario which is which could also happen here [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1370.02s)]
*  Which is Trump doesn't openly defy the court and then the court issues are ruling and then Trump says I'm not gonna follow this [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1375.6200000000001s)]
*  like this they just don't you know, right they just don't and [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1381.94s)]
*  They don't do it at the Trump level Trump doesn't talk about it [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1385.54s)]
*  But you know we had to wait for a piece in the Atlantic [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1388.24s)]
*  But Catherine to find out that all of these fuckers at HHS were telling the NIH to violate court orders [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1391.1200000000001s)]
*  so like how many times across how many agencies could that happen and [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1398.96s)]
*  then what [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1403.6000000000001s)]
*  What remedies does the court have you know, they can try to hold people in contempt [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1405.92s)]
*  They none of them have wanted to do that yet [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1410.6000000000001s)]
*  They haven't even wanted to word their rulings or decisions in a way that would suggest that people might face contempt charges [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1412.6s)]
*  Right because I think all these courts are nervous that if they hold someone in contempt in the administration [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1419.2199999999998s)]
*  And then they don't show up like what are they gonna do send the send the marshals cash is cash Patel coming to get him [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1423.78s)]
*  Yeah, it is a very bad this is the real precipice of something very different in American life that we are standing on right now [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1430.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and and part of what I wonder is [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1436.98s)]
*  Like how to put it back together, you know like if we like, you know Democrats win the midterms which we have to [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1440.48s)]
*  but like [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1448.0s)]
*  What's to say that? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1450.24s)]
*  Whatever the Democrats do in Congress or try to stop in Congress that Trump's not just gonna plow ahead or the agencies aren't just gonna [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1452.6s)]
*  Plow ahead, you know, I mean like this is a real we're in for it [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1458.72s)]

*  Since it could end up affecting people's lives even more than doge believe it or not [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1651.52s)]
*  We got two big fights brewing over spending and they're both important for different reasons first [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1656.48s)]
*  We had the House budget resolution or as Trump calls it the big beautiful bill [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1662.68s)]
*  Mike Johnson got this thing passed on Tuesday after both the hardliners on the right and some of the more [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1669.28s)]
*  vulnerable frontline members [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1676.48s)]
*  both reneged on their pledges to oppose it [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1678.4s)]
*  So the urging of Trump under the urging of Trump in fact [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1682.16s)]
*  there was a couple holdouts and it looked like it might not pass and they pulled the bill and [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1685.96s)]
*  One of them was Victoria Sparks. Did you see the puck story on this? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1691.0s)]
*  No, no, apparently Trump called Victoria Sparks and started screaming at her and said [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1694.36s)]
*  You're you'll just be a fake Republican [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1700.72s)]
*  I'm the president remember who I am started screaming and like people were hearing him scream at her and [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1703.12s)]
*  Then she hangs up and Mike Johnson's right there and he pats her on the back and he goes, you know what you have to do now [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1707.92s)]
*  fucking mob just [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1714.32s)]
*  Mob family that's where we are right now [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1716.48s)]
*  Yeah, I mean related to this is there was another story about how [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1718.6399999999999s)]
*  Trump Trump's team has told the the Republican congressional campaign committee the NRC see as it's known that [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1723.48s)]
*  They were only gonna support candidates who are who pledge their loyalty to Trump? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1730.04s)]
*  Yes [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1734.32s)]
*  And so this this is gonna matter for because the budget resolution is like the first step in passing the bill, right? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1734.6799999999998s)]
*  It's just a it's basically like a shell of a bill [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1741.3799999999999s)]
*  It's instructions to the committees whatever blah blah blah, you don't you don't really need to know you just need to know [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1744.6399999999999s)]
*  It's the first step in the process. It's a first [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1748.9199999999998s)]
*  It's a critical but largely meaningless step right because if you're a Republican who is thinking of not voting for the final [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1751.28s)]
*  You vote for the budget resolution because it's a step. It's it just moves the whole thing a step forward [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1759.08s)]
*  We had we dealt with the same thing with mansion and cinema in Joe Biden's [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1763.1599999999999s)]
*  Legislation and build back better which then became inflation reduction act is they were like, yeah [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1768.4399999999998s)]
*  We're gonna vote for the budget resolution and then will do we do a little explainer on this sir. Sure. Yeah [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1773.48s)]
*  So just to people understand what Trump is trying to do here is he and the Republicans want to pass this bill without fear of a [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1778.1999999999998s)]
*  Democratic filibuster [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1785.3999999999999s)]
*  So the only way to prevent a filibuster on a piece of legislation because the filibuster still exists for legislation [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1786.6799999999998s)]
*  Thank you, Joe mansion here's the cinema, but may actually right now maybe thank you [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1794.1s)]
*  I would be happier if we had passed a whole bunch of other bills like [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1801.94s)]
*  Stupid but is to use the budget reconciliation process, which is a process [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1806.5s)]
*  It was set up understanding that you have to pass a budget and you have to be able to fund the government [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1812.0s)]
*  You have to be able to you have to pass a budget and deal with budgetary matters and you can't do that with the filibuster [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1816.94s)]
*  So this is basically like a filibuster free card [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1821.32s)]
*  Step one of that is pass the budget resolution in many years within you're not trying to use budget reconciliation [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1823.6s)]
*  Congress ever passes a budget because it doesn't you don't really need it [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1829.3999999999999s)]
*  It doesn't remember particularly if the party is the in control of Congress on the other side is different than the president [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1832.96s)]
*  It's it's a fake thing. But here it actually matters [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1839.12s)]
*  All it is is the ticket to ride on the budget reconciliation process the buzz reconciliation process [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1841.2s)]
*  You only need 50 votes, but everything in it must relate to [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1846.8s)]
*  Taxes and spending right you have to pass something cast laws that are just like, you know, like we couldn't [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1850.92s)]
*  Well, famously we couldn't raise the minimum wage through budget. Yes, because there are some there's something called the bird rule [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1858.08s)]
*  named after Robert bird which [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1864.24s)]
*  Dictates what is allowed in the budget resolution process when there is a question the Senate parliamentarian rules on that now [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1867.44s)]
*  it is worth noting that the [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1874.36s)]
*  Presiding officer of the Senate can ignore the parliamentarian and some of us may have made a case that they should have done that back then [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1877.36s)]
*  But lo and behold, we don't voting rights. So but at least the parliamentarian's integrity is intact [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1884.8s)]
*  And so like so that's the process that has begun and now the Republicans both the house and the Senate [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1890.6799999999998s)]
*  separately theoretically have to write a [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1897.36s)]
*  gigantic tax bill and a giant spending cuts bill that they have to pass [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1900.52s)]
*  Before the debt ceiling runs out sometime in late July or August [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1905.34s)]
*  And the important thing to realize here is that? [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1909.22s)]
*  None of their math works and none of them have agreed on anything really because they have promised and [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1913.1s)]
*  It's a lot of this is in the budget resolution a couple trillion dollars worth of spending cuts [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1918.98s)]
*  Which you can only get if you really tackle Medicare Medicaid [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1923.78s)]
*  Social Security veterans health care [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1928.22s)]
*  They've also promised [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1931.46s)]
*  Over four trillion dollars in tax cuts [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1933.54s)]
*  They want to make the Trump tax cuts permanent. They want new tax cuts. That's a lot [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1937.1000000000001s)]
*  They want to raise the debt ceiling by four trillion dollars. None of this adds up [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1940.9s)]
*  either do you adds up mathematically or [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1945.54s)]
*  legislatively exactly and [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1949.06s)]
*  What everyone's focusing on is the house budget resolution? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1951.82s)]
*  instructs the committees to find eight hundred and eighty billion dollars in savings from Medicaid and yet [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1956.1000000000001s)]
*  All the Republicans including Donald Trump are out there and Mike Johnson saying we're not gonna actually touch [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1962.66s)]
*  Medicaid benefits that people are gonna get where it's always fraud and abuse [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1969.18s)]
*  so and the Senate is basically like [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1973.94s)]
*  That too much Medicaid. We don't want to touch Medicaid, but if they don't touch Medicaid then they need to find spending cuts other places [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1977.7s)]
*  But there's just not a lot of money other places [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1984.8200000000002s)]
*  What do you think's gonna happen here like do you is there a version of this that works that you can see [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1987.1399999999999s)]
*  Well, there's gonna be a version to lift the debt limit before we default on the full freight of credit United States [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1992.58s)]
*  And look Trump is able to get this through last time fully unpaid for [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=1999.98s)]
*  Like they did not do cuts to pay for it. Will he be able to do that again? He obviously had a much larger [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2004.4199999999998s)]
*  House majority relatively larger house majority. It's not a huge house majority [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2010.06s)]
*  It's really incredibly [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2014.86s)]
*  Complicated the the Medicare sorry the Medicaid math and people just so people know Medicaid provides health care and nursing home care for like 72 [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2017.6999999999998s)]
*  million Americans and [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2024.9799999999998s)]
*  from including children, yep, and [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2027.02s)]
*  One that they've talked about all kinds of things, you know, one of the things that the Republicans are some better homes are batting around is [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2029.8999999999999s)]
*  One of the ways in which a lot of people have access to [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2037.1399999999999s)]
*  Affordable health care is through a provision in the Affordable Care Act called Medicaid expansion where the government covers 90% of the [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2039.42s)]
*  Medicaid match for state Medicaid funds if they expand health care [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2046.22s)]
*  They may be trying to cut that back which would kick a whole bunch of people off health care [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2050.1400000000003s)]
*  It means work requirements would save them a hundred billion dollars [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2054.78s)]
*  There's also a bunch of Medicaid reforms that we proposed that I think didn't go through that for like target waste fraud and abuse [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2060.02s)]
*  And tax stuff they could throw those in there like I could see them getting to a point where they [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2067.38s)]
*  Cut some Medicaid [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2074.34s)]
*  That didn't necessarily get to people's benefits and they got they did some other stuff there just to say that they did they got [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2076.1400000000003s)]
*  Some fraud and abuse but they didn't cut the benefits here and there and then they just add to the deficit make the tax cuts permanent [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2082.46s)]
*  Somehow lie about the accounting [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2090.54s)]
*  That's one thing and then we're gonna do and then when the hardliners on the in the house and ran Paul in the Senate [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2092.94s)]
*  start yelling about it and [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2098.86s)]
*  Then Donald Trump just calls them and like threatens them [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2100.7799999999997s)]
*  I mean the only get that that's that's the only way this passes is a whole bunch of people have to vote for a bill [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2103.54s)]
*  That they said they would never vote for yes, they there have to vote for a [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2108.8s)]
*  Tax cut that massively increases the deficit which seems like seems like no matter what they do even even in their own mass [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2112.38s)]
*  It increases the deficit [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2118.82s)]
*  Without any sort of significant spending reductions or changes to programs like Medicaid or they have to [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2121.3s)]
*  Slash Medicaid in a way in which they all said they would not do yes Donald Trump [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2128.98s)]
*  It's worth just knowing Donald Trump in [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2133.0800000000004s)]
*  2016 campaign said he would not touch Medicaid and then he pushed like hell to pass a bill to [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2135.86s)]
*  repeal the Affordable Care Act that drastically [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2141.7400000000002s)]
*  Slashed Medicaid and even if they don't touch Medicaid [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2144.3s)]
*  It's important for everyone to realize nothing in this bill is for you [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2147.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, unless you make over seven hundred fifty thousand dollars a year in which case you're in the top 1% [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2151.3399999999997s)]
*  And you will get a very substantial tax cut. It's about a trillion dollars in tax cuts just for the top 1% and [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2157.4599999999996s)]
*  Everyone else yeah, maybe you get like a couple hundred dollars [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2165.8999999999996s)]
*  You're probably not gonna get more than your current you already got exactly right [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2168.68s)]
*  So you've had this tax cuts in 2017 and they don't even think there's gonna be room in there for his no tax on tips [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2172.14s)]
*  Proposal although maybe someone will find out a way to get in there, but like there's nothing else for anyone [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2177.7599999999998s)]
*  It's not gonna help fix the deficit or even lower the deficit is gonna add to the deficit make the deficit worse [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2182.0s)]
*  And it's gonna cut a bunch of other shit that a lot of people depend on [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2187.12s)]
*  Just it you it would be a hard to go into a lab to craft a policy [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2191.08s)]
*  more unpopular than [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2197.0s)]
*  cutting [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2199.72s)]
*  healthcare for [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2201.32s)]
*  Americans to pay for a tax cut for billionaires [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2203.36s)]
*  Yep, and again [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2205.8399999999997s)]
*  The alternative is they don't touch health care [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2208.3599999999997s)]
*  Which is gonna be really hard and I don't believe that they'll be able to but they don't and then you go go test this one [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2211.24s)]
*  A tax cut for billionaires that just adds to the deficit. Well, we we did this we tested it and it was very [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2216.64s)]
*  It showed up in a shitload of 2018 house mentor meds. Yeah [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2223.0s)]
*  We got that one. We did pretty good. That was a fun election. Yeah, okay [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2227.9199999999996s)]
*  The other issue that Congress has to deal with much sooner is government funding [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2233.4s)]
*  Which runs out in about two weeks? [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2238.68s)]
*  So usually only two things happen with the shutdown first it looms and then it's averted. That's great fucking writing [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2240.84s)]
*  That's the really gave me that line. That's good read [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2247.64s)]
*  Anyway, the so the way a shutdowns averted these days is by passing a continuing resolution [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2250.64s)]
*  known as a CR [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2256.72s)]
*  Which just keeps the government open at current spending levels with the hope that an actual budget gets passed somewhere down the line [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2258.36s)]
*  Which is probably probably what happened? [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2266.0800000000004s)]
*  Which never happens. It's we've been we've been funding the government government on CRS for like CRS and omnibus spending agreements [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2268.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, forever. It's a fucking it's on the no one's passed the fucking appropriations bill in a long time, right? [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2275.04s)]
*  And you know what people in both parties are mad about it. They all complain about it and then it never changes [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2279.36s)]
*  So two problems for Republicans this time around one [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2284.04s)]
*  The house doesn't know if they can pass a CR with just Republican votes [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2287.7999999999997s)]
*  Since they have a few loony hardliners who have basically like made a living [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2291.56s)]
*  saying I'll never vote for CR ever and I don't want to lift the debt ceiling and I don't want to do any of this shit because [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2297.04s)]
*  They they think that they want to like eliminate all of government [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2302.14s)]
*  So they don't know that they can get all the Republicans second [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2305.08s)]
*  Even if they can get all the Republicans and it passes the house [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2308.0s)]
*  Republicans need 60 votes in the Senate because this is not the 51 vote budget resolution [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2311.0s)]
*  It's a 60 which means they need the votes of at least seven Democrats. So the question becomes [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2315.64s)]
*  What should Democrats do? [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2322.36s)]
*  Mike Johnson said on CNN this week that a CR he wants a CR to include language that codifies the Doge cuts [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2324.2s)]
*  He has also rejected democratic efforts to include some guardrails in the CR around Elon and Doge [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2331.52s)]
*  What do you think them should do? [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2338.76s)]
*  We've been talking about this in many forms personally you and I for a few days now I [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2341.68s)]
*  Start recording our conversations. It would be so much easier. Just turn this whole thing into a reality show [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2347.76s)]
*  Doing multiple times [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2353.04s)]
*  It's very always like do we talk about this on the pod or text was in person. I don't know [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2355.4s)]
*  I [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2360.4s)]
*  do not think the Democrats can vote for a [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2361.76s)]
*  Bill that does not do something to stop what Elon Musk and Trump are doing what they're doing is dangerous and [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2366.48s)]
*  Frankly unconstitutional and they cannot allow it to happen. Now. There's some ways in which to go [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2374.36s)]
*  I think to go about this that would be smart [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2379.32s)]
*  Senate Democrats should insist should really say and insist that the house goes first [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2381.6s)]
*  They should not negotiate and I think that like Mitch McConnell was still there [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2385.52s)]
*  He'd make the house go first because he does not want to pass a bill [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2389.04s)]
*  That he sends to the house of the house and rejects [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2391.64s)]
*  He needs the house to collapse in a heap of their own failure, which they often do and then [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2393.68s)]
*  Hand them then what he does is he gets together with Schumer? [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2399.12s)]
*  Passes a bill that has some sort of bipartisan agreement sends it to the house since all this members home and says pass it or be [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2401.6s)]
*  responsible for shutting down the government and [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2407.0s)]
*  So the house goes first that really [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2409.52s)]
*  Simplifies things because Democrats aren't the one shutting down the government, right? [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2411.56s)]
*  Either Mike Johnson in the House Republicans can keep it open or they can't and so leave it on them. That's one [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2414.7599999999998s)]
*  Two I think you in the way in which we talk about this [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2421.52s)]
*  It has to be about the specific things that Elon Musk and Donald Trump have done that have hurt people [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2425.96s)]
*  Right food safety cancer research [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2432.44s)]
*  The FAA having air having company air traffic controllers [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2436.04s)]
*  It cannot be about the power of the purse or congressional progress [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2439.1600000000003s)]
*  I've already seen some members of Congress and a political story on this today talking about that [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2442.36s)]
*  Cannot be about that is that we have to be protecting people [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2446.76s)]
*  From cuts that are hurting them like that. That is absolutely essential and [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2449.56s)]
*  Look, there is risk in a shutdown [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2455.8s)]
*  Politically like they're a shutdown is going we are not the one shutting down the government [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2458.0800000000004s)]
*  Republicans are shutting it down because they cannot pass a bill and now they are too incompetent to do it [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2462.0s)]
*  Or if it gets to the Senate Republicans are I mean? [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2466.0800000000004s)]
*  the reason they couldn't get Democratic votes is because they are just blatantly destroying government with like [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2469.56s)]
*  Illegally previous shutdowns have always have other that previous shutdowns have happened when the [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2477.04s)]
*  government is divided and the part in the house usually Republicans in the house refused to [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2483.7599999999998s)]
*  Bring up a bill to keep it open right or they pass them and they know the president won't sign [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2488.96s)]
*  Probably control all the levers of government if they can't get the key if they can't keep this thing open that's on them [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2493.7599999999998s)]
*  And there is political risk in this like shutdowns are bad. The people get hurt in them [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2498.64s)]
*  We don't we do not want this to happen [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2503.64s)]
*  But also we do not we cannot save the Republicans from themselves here [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2505.92s)]
*  Yeah [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2510.3599999999997s)]
*  Because it's the one point of leverage we have and there there is political risk in it, right? [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2511.4s)]
*  They're absolutely always is but I think the greater [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2515.56s)]
*  Political risk in the long term for Democrats here would be to walk away from a fight [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2519.64s)]
*  when the party [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2523.96s)]
*  Absolutely must demonstrate strength must find a point of conflict where we can demonstrate to the American people [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2525.8799999999997s)]
*  We can grab their attention and demonstrate the American people [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2531.64s)]
*  What it is we stand for and who we're fighting for if we walk away from that [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2534.08s)]
*  We're not gonna get another opportunity [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2537.24s)]
*  No [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2538.4s)]
*  I was gonna say we have said now many times that Democrats don't have much leverage and much power in [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2538.92s)]
*  This Trump presidency at least for these two years and that is true [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2546.0s)]
*  except for moments like this right moments where you need 60 votes in the Senate is like the only leverage we have and [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2550.44s)]
*  We've just talked about stories where the courts are issuing rulings that are not being followed [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2556.96s)]
*  Where Elon Musk and his people are going in getting access to our private data and personal information? [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2565.28s)]
*  they are firing people that are providing services that are in some cases life-saving the people depend on and [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2571.44s)]
*  Democrats are complaining sending letters in some cases [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2578.04s)]
*  Republicans are starting to complain and send letters those letters are getting not respond those letters are not being responded to at all [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2581.0s)]
*  Donald Trump and Elon Musk are basically saying fuck off as are the rest of the people they have in the government there are [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2588.2799999999997s)]
*  Nominees that were voted into the cabinet that just lied during their hearings said they weren't gonna do this work through that [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2593.88s)]
*  And now we're just doing it anyway, so like yeah [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2600.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that you need if you want our votes [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2603.3199999999997s)]
*  In the Senate then you need to like start following the fucking law and being responsible stewards of [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2606.4s)]
*  People's tax dollars and not cutting the services that they depend on [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2612.8s)]
*  Just there has been this real [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2616.6000000000004s)]
*  Dissonance at times between Democratic rhetoric and Democratic actions we talk about the existential threat of Donald Trump we talk about the [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2619.6400000000003s)]
*  Deeply damaging things he is doing or could do and then we were then but our response exists in the frame of normal politics [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2628.7200000000003s)]
*  Yes, and if this is as dangerous as we believe it is and I think [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2635.84s)]
*  Senate and House Democrats believe it is as they say it is then you have to be willing to engage in [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2640.2400000000002s)]
*  More politically risky maneuvers to try to do something to stop. Yeah [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2647.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and I think like I think they need the fight. You know [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2652.78s)]
*  Well, we'll be talking more about this in the next couple weeks one more thing here on the serious topics list [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2658.6000000000004s)]
*  It's a long list on Wednesday Jeff Bezos [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2664.32s)]
*  Sent out a memo to the staff of the Washington Post which of course he owns [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2667.96s)]
*  Saying that from here on out the opinion page would quote be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2672.24s)]
*  Personal liberties and free markets will cover other topics too [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2679.64s)]
*  Of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2683.16s)]
*  He then informed staff that David Shipley the opinion editor would be leaving the paper as a result of his decision [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2688.88s)]
*  Former Washington Post journalist Gene Weingarten today also reported that a piece about Bezos new policy by post media reporter [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2694.8s)]
*  Eric Wemple was killed [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2702.84s)]
*  You wrote a message box about this on Wednesday. Give us your take [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2705.56s)]
*  This is a very sad day for the Washington Post the Washington Post is while it's been struggling financially in recent years is [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2709.4s)]
*  One of the most important media institutions in the country it is famed as a media institution that will [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2715.28s)]
*  cover anyone and everything without fear or favor that will stand up to [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2722.28s)]
*  incredibly powerful forces in this country, they took down a president they published the [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2726.44s)]
*  Pentagon papers and [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2730.92s)]
*  Come up with the slogan democracy dies in darkness, which that was kind of on that [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2732.64s)]
*  That was in the probably the beginning of the decline feels a long way away, doesn't it? Yes [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2736.48s)]
*  But now [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2741.56s)]
*  The at least the opinion section of that paper is nothing more than an organ for the billionaire with multiple interests in front of the [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2742.8399999999997s)]
*  federal government that owns the paper, yeah, and [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2749.52s)]
*  What I think this so this is a problem for the post [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2753.96s)]
*  It's deeply demoralizing and unfair to the journal the very good journalists the post who do very good reporting [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2756.2s)]

*  From Jeff Bezos, right doesn't say there's no report [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2964.96s)]

*  Politico or puck or someone else will write the story [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2981.2000000000003s)]
*  Right now the post did not do it [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2984.56s)]
*  And so what do we think is going to happen when let's say the post were to stumble on this [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2986.9599999999996s)]
*  the example used in my message box were let's say the post were to stumble on a scoop akin to the [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2992.72s)]
*  Access Hollywood tapes or when the New York Times got Trump's tax returns [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=2997.8799999999997s)]

*  stopped the the public's like there'd be mass resignation at the post and be the end of it like we would all know that but [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=3026.2400000000002s)]

*  Some of it'll be you know what we're doing here cooking me a pot say America or what I'm writing on the message box [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=3056.54s)]

*  Takes flying left and right and that's all that we have [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=3073.78s)]
*  like we need to make journalism a [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=3076.54s)]
*  Viable business, but you're right that like independent journalism [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=3080.0600000000004s)]
*  Which is you know, there's not there's not enough of it right now [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=3084.3s)]

*  Somewhere is hiding the real Epstein files and she's demanding that they be delivered to her [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=3912.64s)]
*  Tomorrow Friday when you're listening to this today [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=3919.4399999999996s)]
*  Thank you so stupid also it's funny it's also about like like sex trafficking of children this whole thing and [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=3924.3599999999997s)]
*  I don't know what people are looking for [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=3932.68s)]
*  They have all all the MAGA people have gotten themselves into the space where they think that there's some Epstein files [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=3935.2799999999997s)]
*  I guess is gonna be like a list of how high-profile Democrats and [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=3941.3999999999996s)]
*  Democratic leaning celebrities and media figures who are who have all helped Jeffrey Epstein traffic children [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=3946.52s)]
*  I guess this is what they're looking for. That's what they think is there they think it's like a pizza gate thing [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=3953.0s)]
*  It's exactly it is part of which is why the guy was at the White House pizza gate Cuban on [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=3956.3199999999997s)]
*  Conspiracy narrative this is what they think and they think these files are there and but it is here's what's interesting about it [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=3961.92s)]
*  Tell me [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=3967.76s)]
*  well, I've [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=3969.36s)]
*  Been thinking about this for a while because they now have everything they've won everything right they got the they got the White House [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=3971.16s)]
*  They've got this right-wing media apparatus. They've got the FBI. They've got they've got it all they've won all the branches [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=3976.7200000000003s)]
*  But they still have a bunch of dumb conspiracy theories that aren't true [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=3983.08s)]
*  They're still gonna fuck things up as they have been in the last month [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=3986.38s)]
*  They're not gonna get their way all the time [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=3989.7000000000003s)]
*  And so they are still going to blame have people to blame like lest we think oh they own everything now [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=3991.5s)]
*  And now who now who are they gonna blame they always find people to blame [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=3997.98s)]
*  There's always deep state people out there that still haven't been you know found in the agencies [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4001.1400000000003s)]
*  And they're still they're still lurking and they miss the purge miss them and so there's always [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4006.98s)]
*  Some kind there's gonna be democratic governors who were villains or anything anywhere. There's an elected Democrat [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4011.8999999999996s)]
*  Anywhere there's someone in the media who is not loyal to Trump anywhere [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4017.9399999999996s)]
*  There's some bureaucrat who isn't a loyalist to mega they'll be blamed to blame to be cast. Yeah, that's the entire [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4021.3799999999997s)]
*  Evil genius behind the deep state narrative is it allows reporters and control everything and have someone within their own government to blame now [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4028.8999999999996s)]
*  That can work with a segment of people who are looking for reasons to stick with Donald Trump [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4035.8999999999996s)]
*  Fucking crazy people yeah, well, I mean just Republican based voters right right if you like Donald Trump [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4040.94s)]
*  I'm thinking that I was thinking about the pizza gate the just the the [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4045.94s)]
*  Pizza gate is off of it [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4049.2999999999997s)]
*  But just this idea that Donald Trump is failing because someone inside the government is preventing him from succeeding which is how a lot of Republicans [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4050.46s)]
*  Justified Trump's colossal failures in his first term. Yeah, but that's not gonna work for everyone [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4057.8599999999997s)]
*  No, it's not isn't you're right. I totally agree with that. I just think it is wild [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4063.94s)]
*  That the Attorney General of the United States sent a letter to the FBI director [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4069.1s)]
*  Saying that there's a deep state hiding files that are going to expose corruption from Jeffrey Epstein who is dead [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4073.86s)]
*  That's just follow the story closely [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4081.14s)]
*  Anyway, that's our crazy shit for for this week [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4083.58s)]

*  You can get started with a free seven-day trial [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4156.04s)]
*  I think there is a way to be respectful and valuing the freedom of the press [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4158.5599999999995s)]
*  Without being so old-school wrapped up into the rules [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4164.84s)]
*  They want you to live by because they're not effective in terms of how you communicate with the public anymore [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4168.04s)]
*  And that is like you got it like if you're running for president now, you're gonna be in the White House [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4172.74s)]
*  Throw out some of how some of this is done to state the obvious [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4176.68s)]
*  Yeah, I would just one other thing on this because I can't let it go is [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4180.0s)]
*  Part of the problem for the press here is they have a boy who cried wolf problem [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4183.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, which if you screen that the president not having a formal press conference or not doing enough [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4186.320000000001s)]
*  Rope-lying Q&A's is an abridgment of freedom of speech. Then people are gonna take you less seriously when [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4192.04s)]
*  Whether they're the actual when there is an actual threat to press freedom, which is what happened to this president there [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4199.280000000001s)]
*  there's been too much confusion between [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4204.02s)]
*  the First Amendment and access and when you get mad about that when you when you paint access or [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4206.46s)]
*  transparency as a [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4213.34s)]
*  Threat on freedom of speech then you you are sort of [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4215.9800000000005s)]
*  You're setting yourself up for when the actual threat to freedom of speech comes to be taken less seriously [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4218.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, and also the American people [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4223.14s)]
*  I don't think believe that the only person who can ask a president a question is somebody who has a seat in the White House [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4225.02s)]
*  briefing room [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4230.620000000001s)]
*  That's just because it's not so, you know the notion that they're the only ones [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4231.18s)]
*  It's just isn't how the world works anymore. But yes, that was better stated than what I said [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4235.18s)]
*  I was getting at the same point. It will it's an interesting fight that the Trump people are picking and [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4239.900000000001s)]
*  I think part of the reason they're doing it is just for the sake of having the fight because like Trump himself [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4245.700000000001s)]
*  It's not like he's not visible and not out there answering questions and doesn't like to mix it up with the press [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4250.780000000001s)]
*  Like he is in our faces way more than even his first term [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4256.4400000000005s)]
*  And so he's like willing to answer questions if he doesn't like your question he'll yell at you he'll lie [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4261.780000000001s)]
*  He'll you know do whatever but he's answering those questions. So it's it's funny that they [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4266.860000000001s)]
*  They are kicking out press even though he is very available to the press. It's weird [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4273.18s)]
*  But don't you think it's because they think it's and I think it is effective [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4278.9800000000005s)]
*  Unfortunately and getting some to obey in advance, right? [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4283.34s)]
*  Yes [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4287.1s)]
*  Congratulations to me, but you know, I think it's it is it is that and it doesn't mean it's like people outlets or [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4318.1s)]
*  Reporters are gonna be like oh, we're obeying in advance now [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4326.1s)]
*  They just do it, you know what I mean, and I think they know that it work that it can work in some capacity [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4329.14s)]
*  Yeah, so before we go Jen, you started to give advice to [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4334.780000000001s)]
*  future Democratic presidential candidates future Democratic [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4339.72s)]
*  Comm's directors press secretaries we have talked over the years about press strategies [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4343.099999999999s)]
*  communication strategies message strategies, it seems like now [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4349.219999999999s)]
*  We need attention strategies. What are some good attention strategies for future people who are gonna sit where you guys at? [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4353.099999999999s)]
*  Hopefully Democrats someday. Oh my god. That's such a good question [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4361.219999999999s)]
*  I mean, I'm gonna steal a little bit of what Dan said which is like Democrats sometimes [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4366.54s)]
*  Don't take advantage of the cultural moments. It doesn't have to just be the Super Bowl [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4372.179999999999s)]
*  sometimes there is an unwillingness or discomfort in [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4377.219999999999s)]
*  Showing all sides of yourself, you know [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4381.42s)]
*  I mean Democrat a lot of there's a lot of like extremely smart Democrats out there [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4384.0s)]
*  A lot of them are elected. You don't have to always talk like you are defending your [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4388.139999999999s)]
*  PhD thesis right at every moment you can talk about your love for [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4393.38s)]
*  Sports football art cultural things music, whatever it may be [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4398.179999999999s)]
*  there is a [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4402.5s)]
*  Stiffness sometimes is one of the things I would say maybe there's another way of saying it [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4405.0599999999995s)]
*  Everybody needs to let their hair down a little bit more [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4410.74s)]
*  I don't know. I just use 12 analogies, but I think you know what I'm you're right [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4413.139999999999s)]
*  The other thing I would say about communicators, which is less about the attention, but I do think it helps you in this regard is [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4418.179999999999s)]
*  One of the things that helped me and being the bridesmaid many times for the press secretary job and never the bride until finally [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4426.06s)]
*  Is that you have to know the policy and the policy and the substance of the person you're working for? [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4433.12s)]
*  What do they believe? Why do they believe it? What's the answer to the 18th question? [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4440.54s)]
*  Sometimes people think of being a press secretary and this is where people get confused about the attention question as being able to craft a good [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4444.820000000001s)]
*  Tweet or X or whatever the hell we're calling it [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4451.22s)]
*  It's not just that it's like you've got to understand the depth of the housing policy so you can help your boss [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4453.58s)]
*  Figure out how to communicate and talk about it in a human way. Yeah, and sometimes I think that part is is undervalued [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4460.38s)]
*  Yeah, no, I hear that because I had to become I had to become an expert in like [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4468.18s)]
*  Different like every topic but like an inch deep right like I don't want to go too deep on [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4473.9400000000005s)]
*  Which I still don't know if I could explain now [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4478.54s)]
*  But like credit default swaps was like a phrase that came out of my mouth a lot in [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4480.58s)]
*  Me and you both in 2009. Yeah [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4484.62s)]
*  We had to like Larry Summers had to teach us [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4487.3s)]
*  Dan [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4492.66s)]
*  Okay, I give a few pieces of advice [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4494.1s)]
*  the first is [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4496.1s)]
*  when I was the I was the communications director on the transition which meant one of my jobs was to try to figure out how to [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4497.7s)]
*  set up the White House Communications Office and [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4504.0199999999995s)]
*  So [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4506.900000000001s)]
*  They handed me a binder on my first day which had the org charts for every White House Communications and Press Office from Jimmy Carter until [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4508.9800000000005s)]
*  George W Bush and [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4516.02s)]
*  The thing that is so fucking alarming is the Carter and the Bush ones are almost exactly the same [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4517.540000000001s)]
*  Yeah, thank you. And you know what frankly, it's changed some but not that not that much not much [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4521.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4526.860000000001s)]
*  And so I would tell every person if you're about to start a your presidential campaign your Senate campaign your Senate office job [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4527.5s)]
*  Take the org chart you have and light that thing on fucking fire because what it is is that's all we're all we're doing is [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4533.64s)]
*  We're building on a view of communications that uses the traditional legacy media as the primary message for delivering [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4539.84s)]
*  The primary vehicle for delivering our message. So we have to get it if you keep just tinker around the edges [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4546.8s)]
*  You're always gonna keep doing the same thing. It's why legacy media brands keep failing because they keep trying to become digital by just [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4551.88s)]
*  Appending on to the old print infrastructure, whatever it is. So that's one dish that so [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4559.400000000001s)]
*  Doge that org chart. I need [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4565.72s)]
*  I need I need a dozen guys under the age of 22 who need to go to the prom [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4569.0s)]
*  And so the the second thing is you is we have to think about communications as message delivery, right? [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4578.160000000001s)]
*  It's both cut it's almost all content generation or message generation or heads like what's the event we do? [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4584.72s)]
*  What's the interview we do? What's the social media post we do? [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4590.08s)]
*  The real question is the one we should build all of our infrastructure on is how do you get the piece of information? [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4592.68s)]
*  That you want to put out in front of the people that you need to see it [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4597.360000000001s)]
*  It used to be that you would just put it out in the press and they would organically consume it in some way shape or form [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4601.08s)]
*  It doesn't work that way anymore [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4607.360000000001s)]
*  So you have to have an actual plan to do it and you have to build up in infrastructure that allows that that includes both [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4608.52s)]
*  like very aggressive [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4614.68s)]
*  like influencer work organic social stuff and [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4616.88s)]
*  Actually, the thing that I've had most passionate about is empowering your supporters to be your messengers, right to actually carry your message [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4620.240000000001s)]
*  and the next thing is just I want to I said it Jen saying but it's so important is [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4627.4800000000005s)]
*  And everyone says politics is downstream of culture. That's so true. And but the real thing but and that is true [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4632.72s)]
*  but the thing that I think in terms of communications is if you are a [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4638.64s)]
*  politician [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4643.12s)]
*  Find the thing outside of politics that you are passionate about and can talk about authentically and go talk about that thing all the time [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4644.44s)]
*  Like like I still am so struck by the Kamala Harris interview on caller daddy and it was all policy. Yeah [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4651.32s)]
*  Yeah, like you know the Trump interview obviously that was 30 call [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4658.36s)]
*  The color died was like 30 minutes and the trumpet rogue interview was three hours [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4662.799999999999s)]
*  But the part of the Trump rogue interview that worked for him was when he was just talking about UFC [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4665.799999999999s)]
*  Like a guy who kept like a UFC fan right and like for some segment of his audience that's his persuadable universe [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4670.92s)]
*  That's a big deal like go if it's sports go talk about sports all time [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4676.599999999999s)]
*  If it's pop culture talk about pop culture if you go talk about what was on white lotus or which Bravo shows you like or which? [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4680.2s)]
*  music you like right and [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4686.24s)]
*  Because that is a way to connect with people outside of politics Obama did this all the time [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4688.24s)]
*  Yeah, right and he could he could do all this thing [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4692.88s)]
*  He could talk about sports he could talk about movies [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4694.639999999999s)]
*  But find ways to do that so that you can connect with people in something other than policy because [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4696.0s)]
*  If you have that human connection first, then they're gonna be more willing to listen what you have to say about the other stuff [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4700.92s)]
*  That's so can I give them two more pieces of advice because we're rooting for these people to bring us back [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4705.48s)]
*  One is this is so obvious in old school, but like why are you running for president? [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4711.56s)]
*  Please determine the answer to that question [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4716.84s)]
*  the second thing is [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4719.68s)]
*  Figure out what you actually think of a range of policy issues, right? [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4722.08s)]
*  I mean we go through this thing where you see politicians try to bend themselves into a pretzel [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4726.88s)]
*  answering questions about any range of issues and it's like [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4732.240000000001s)]
*  Start with the place and this is like to comms people who are advising people who may run for president [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4735.84s)]
*  What do you think about what's happening in Israel? What is what do you actually think? Right? What do you think should happen with health care? [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4740.12s)]
*  and I think sometimes [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4747.4400000000005s)]
*  It gets so wrapped up in like poll tested language and words that it's confusing and it doesn't feel authentic [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4749.44s)]
*  And if you piss some people off, that's okay. And I think we've gotten a little bit away from that [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4756.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4762.0s)]
*  Use polling and research to help you find the most effective way to talk about what you believe [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4763.48s)]
*  Believe and what you care about what you want to prioritize, right? [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4771.16s)]
*  Like that's that should be the direction not the other way around [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4774.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, one final piece of advice John that's very important [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4777.2s)]
*  So fun is it you and I have been podcasting for three presidential elections now [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4780.2s)]
*  Oh my god [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4784.08s)]
*  And I would say the record of people who've been on our podcast is one to know and the record of people who did not [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4784.92s)]
*  Go on our podcast is oh and two [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4789.8s)]
*  Just something just something to think about [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4793.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, but that is such a good I will say just go back to the New York Times editorial board thing [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4796.28s)]
*  It's like there is still people who are of the age who might run for president who think if you have a Washington Post [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4801.98s)]
*  Op-ed I keep picking on them. It's really I don't it's not even Jeff Bezos related like that's written in the print form [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4808.219999999999s)]
*  You're reaching America. I'm here to tell you you're not and so actually to Dan's point [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4813.42s)]
*  Don't be so fragile about like what the name of the outlet is like who is reaching people and how is it reaching them? [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4818.62s)]
*  And is it reaching the audience? You're trying to reach? That's it [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4825.46s)]
*  It doesn't matter what their name is doesn't matter how long they've been around [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4827.92s)]
*  Doesn't matter what their masthead is or no masthead and that that would serve a lot of people [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4830.62s)]
*  Talk to everyone all the time and just be fucking human [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4836.54s)]
*  Be human talk like you're talking to people in your life [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4841.42s)]
*  And if you talk to people in your life like you talk as a politician then don't run for office [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4845.94s)]
*  Please stop yourself. Thanks for listening. If you like what you heard [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4851.06s)]
*  We hope you'll subscribe at crooked comm slash friends or through the pod save America feed on Apple podcast [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4854.24s)]
*  Love it Tommy and I will be back with a new show on Tuesday. Talk to everybody then have a great weekend. Bye everyone [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0t7u4gnaqc&t=4858.64s)]
