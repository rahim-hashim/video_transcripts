Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Kamala Harris’ Senior Advisor on Donald Trump and the Polls
**Pod Save America:** [October 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU)
*  Welcome to a special episode of Pod Save America. I'm Dan Pfeiffer. This is the first of four bonus [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=0.0s)]
*  pods I'll be hosting on Sundays in the lead up to the election. These episodes will be focused [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=4.88s)]
*  on something that keeps us all up at night, polling. What's a good poll, what's a bad poll, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  and how can you tell the difference? If you like these episodes, I highly recommend you sign up to [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=13.68s)]
*  get my subscriber show Polar Coaster by subscribing to Friends of the Pod at crooked.com slash [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=17.12s)]
*  friends or through the Apple Podcast feed. It's where we dig really deep into polling. It's a [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=21.76s)]
*  great way to support crooked media. And we have a 25% off discount for annual subscriptions right [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=25.84s)]
*  now. In today's episode, I'll be talking with Kamala Harris, senior campaign advisor, David Plouffe [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=30.48s)]
*  about the state of the race, the Harris campaign's targets in the last 30 days, and how the electoral [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=34.72s)]
*  map is shaping up. And then with ECCE's research partner, Carlos Odio, to discuss the latest with [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=39.36s)]
*  the potentially most consequential vote of the entire election, the Latino vote. Joining us now [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=43.92s)]
*  is my former boss, Obama's campaign manager, my boss in the White House, senior advisor to the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=48.64s)]
*  Harris campaign, David Plouffe. David, thanks for joining us. Dan Pfeiffer, always a privilege to [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=54.08s)]
*  talk politics with you. Okay, we are in the middle of a quadrennial tradition. It's October. There is [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  panic in the streets. Axios today says the blue wall is crumbling. The vibes are everywhere. Every [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=66.16s)]
*  anxious Democrat in town is calling every political reporter in earshot to vet their concerns. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=71.84s)]
*  Where do you see the race right now? And how has it changed, if at all, in the last couple weeks? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=78.32s)]
*  Well, Dan, I think from the time Kamala Harris became the nominee, we saw a lot of movement, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=83.52s)]
*  you know, five, six points, depending on the state. But what we've seen for the last few weeks, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=89.28s)]
*  and the data is consistent this week, is basically a tied race in seven states. And I don't think [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=93.36s)]
*  that's going to change. So, you know, I think it's 47, 48 for each of us. I'd still rather be Kamala [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  Harris and Donald Trump, because I think she's got a slightly higher ceiling. I think she's got a [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=107.36s)]
*  better ability to win more of the undecideds based on who they are. And I think Donald Trump [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=111.6s)]
*  is much more reliant on first-time and infrequent voters this time. I think he's got a fragile [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  mathematical problem there. So you put all that together, but the reality is, you know, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=123.52s)]
*  Donald Trump barely won in 16, but won barely lost in 20. He's a little stronger this time than he [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  was last time. So he's going to get 48% of the vote. And so I know for all of us that want to [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=135.76s)]
*  see Kamala Harris win, we wish there was an easy pathway. That pathway does not exist. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=140.16s)]
*  This is basically going to come down to, you know, history would suggest it's not going to come down [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=145.44s)]
*  to several thousand votes in seven states, but it's going to come down to a very narrow margin. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=150.56s)]
*  And so I think the question for people who've already done so much, quite frankly, is, you know, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  what else can be done? Because every ounce of effort spent by anybody, sharing content, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=161.28s)]
*  making calls, making another donation, traveling to a battleground state, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=165.92s)]
*  matters because this thing is going to be decided on the margin. So I think the freak [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=171.67999999999998s)]
*  out is because there were a bunch of polls, I'd say in the last month, that showed a lead for [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=175.6s)]
*  Kamala Harris that was not real. It's not what we were seeing. We've seen this thing basically be [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=179.11999999999998s)]
*  tied, let's say, since, you know, mid-September. So this is the race we have. It's the race we [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=183.92s)]
*  expected. I don't think it's going to open up for either candidate. I think it's going to be close [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=189.92s)]
*  all the way in. And I would just remind everybody, whether it's internal data or public data, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=193.76s)]
*  you know, a poll that shows Donald Trump up 4847 that then shows us up 4847 is essentially the same [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=198.16s)]
*  thing. This thing's going to be decided on the margins in these few number of states. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=206.23999999999998s)]
*  That's very validating because that's like the core principle of this podcast is a poll that [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=210.72s)]
*  shows you up to and a poll that shows you down to shows the exact same thing, which is a very close [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=215.12s)]
*  winnable race. Let's talk about the persuadable voter universe, the undecideds, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=219.28s)]
*  how big is that universe and who are those voters? It's not that big, but you know, it's probably a [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=223.92s)]
*  true undecided. And let's be clear about that. That is people that we certainly believe they are [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=229.67999999999998s)]
*  going to vote and they yet have not decided between Harris and Trump. You know, that's like 4%. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  Then you have a little bit of soft Trump support, soft Harris support that I'm sure both campaigns [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=241.92s)]
*  are spending time on. Then you've got people who might be deciding between Harris and third party [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  or Trump and third party or whether to vote at all. So you've got to treat them all as a unit, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=251.92s)]
*  right? You've got to run a campaign to reach those undecideds and hope more of them in a tide race. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=256.88s)]
*  If more of them fall to your side, that's a huge deal. And we think we can do that. And then you've [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=261.28s)]
*  got these other questions around, you know, turnout and third party. The third party number [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=266.96s)]
*  is going to be pretty low, but it's not going to be zero. So, you know, the question is in some of [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=273.59999999999997s)]
*  these states, you know, you might be able to win it at 49, but you might have to go closer to 49.5, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=279.28s)]
*  49.7. And in every state, it's a variety of people. This is not like there's one cohort. It's like [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=284.96s)]
*  most of the undecideds are suburban women between ages of 40 and 60. You've got young, you've got [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=292.08s)]
*  black, you've got white, you've got brown, you've got non-college college. So from a campaign [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=297.67999999999995s)]
*  perspective, it's challenging because you've got a bunch of different types of voters who receive [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=304.24s)]
*  information in a bunch of different types of way that you've got to reach. And you want to be in [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=309.6s)]
*  their communities. You want to be in their social media feeds. You obviously want to do advertising. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=314.24s)]
*  Hopefully they'll see the candidate where, as you have seen, and if Kamala Harris and Tim Walsh [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=318.8s)]
*  are going to go everywhere, there's an audience basically, you know, of people that we think will [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=324.08s)]
*  be decisive in this election. You know, I think in previous campaigns, sometimes you have a, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=329.04s)]
*  like a diverse group of people who make up your undecided universe, but you have a commonality [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=333.76s)]
*  in persuasive messages, right? For us in 2012, it didn't matter whether we were trying to get Latino [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=338.0s)]
*  voters or rural non-college educated white voters. It was the economic message is what brought them [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=342.56s)]
*  to the finish line for us. Do you have that here or are we sort of in a more fragmented space? Do we [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=347.44s)]
*  have a slightly different approach to each of these groups? Well, the economy is at the top of [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=351.36s)]
*  the list, of course. And I think we made big progress on that from when the race started in [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=355.91999999999996s)]
*  terms of people saying, who do you trust to look after people like you? Who has economic plans [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=359.84s)]
*  that will help people like me? We've in some places taken the lead on that and we're down [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=365.35999999999996s)]
*  double digits. So economy's huge and that's contrast. Trump's plan will raise taxes by $4,000. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=370.15999999999997s)]
*  It'll blow up the deficit. It'll create inflation. And of course it'll be targeted towards the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=376.08s)]
*  wealthy. So that's very important. Healthcare is important, both from an economic lens, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=380.79999999999995s)]
*  because voters, as you know, look at it, usually first and foremost through an economic lens and [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=385.04s)]
*  then a healthcare lens. So you've got Trump going to cost people a lot more money and also tens of [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=390.40000000000003s)]
*  millions of people lose coverage. Huge issue. Abortion's important to some of these voters, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=395.44s)]
*  particularly on the turnout side. But there's also the character traits, which is who do you trust to [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=400.16s)]
*  be a strong leader? Who's stable? And again, I think we've made huge progress in that regard. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=405.20000000000005s)]
*  So the ads we're running this week, not solely because we're running a lot of different ads [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=411.76s)]
*  to a lot of different people, have people who worked for Trump speaking about how unstable he [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=417.04s)]
*  is and how unfit he is. And we also have a bunch of military leaders and Republicans saying that [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=422.32s)]
*  Kamala Harris has the strength and judgment to be commander in chief. That's important part of the [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=428.0s)]
*  message. At the same time as you're driving economic contrast, healthcare contrast. And [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=431.92s)]
*  we're also at a point in you, she does this in interviews, we still do it in some of her ads, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=436.56s)]
*  Trump is 100% universally known. Now it's not 100% universally known the damage she'll do to the [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=441.92s)]
*  country. We've got to remind people of that. But even things like Kamala Harris's biography, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=447.28000000000003s)]
*  there are still some voters out there who will decide this election that aren't sure she was a [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=452.32s)]
*  prosecutor, that don't understand what she did there, don't understand her middle-class upbringing. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=455.68s)]
*  We've made a lot of progress there. So I think we filled in a lot of that circle. So I think that [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=461.12s)]
*  it's a bunch of different things. And with data, you have a sense of what messages matter the most, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=466.16s)]
*  but it's not just let's compare economic plans and values. That is of course at the top of the [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=470.64s)]
*  pyramid, but we've got to do these other things too. And obviously they're taking wax at us. So [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=476.56s)]
*  we have to make sure we're defending our flank where we see damage being done. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=481.03999999999996s)]
*  Soterios Johnson When you're looking at your internal polling, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=484.0s)]
*  there are always certain character trait measures that you view are essentially correlated to [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=488.47999999999996s)]
*  victory. For us in previous campaigns, it's been fight for people like you, working to increase [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=493.12s)]
*  grow jobs or whatever it is. Are there a couple of things in there that you guys are looking at [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=498.47999999999996s)]
*  that you want to share with us that you think are important to winning over that last group [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=502.32s)]
*  of persuadable voters? Well, that economic question is core for us too. And is that fights for you as [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=507.76s)]
*  opposed to fighting for the economy? Who will look after the middle class? Who will offer ideas and [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=512.56s)]
*  plans that will help people like you and your family? So all those types of questions are [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=518.56s)]
*  important. And in many battleground states, we've actually taken a lead. Strong leaders, always [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=522.4s)]
*  important in a presidential race. This is not a legislative race. And I think you always have to [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=526.8s)]
*  remember that, that strength people as they're making this decision, imagine you during crisis, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=531.52s)]
*  imagine you behind the Oval Office desk. And so that's certainly something we pay attention to. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=536.88s)]
*  Some places where I think we entered the race with a big deficit on who's best on costs and inflation, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=543.04s)]
*  on immigration, on crime. We've seen Kamala Harris make huge progress in those areas, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=549.12s)]
*  but we'd like to make some more. But that look after you fights for people like you is huge. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=553.84s)]
*  And it's particularly important because Trump's out there saying, hey, I had the best economy in [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=562.08s)]
*  the history of the world. I'll just bring it back, which of course is bullshit and not true. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=565.44s)]
*  But when you remind people that everything he's going to do is shower the tax cuts for the wealthy, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=569.0400000000001s)]
*  you're going to pay for it, middle class voter. You are going to pay $4,000 more a year because he [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=574.4s)]
*  wants to talk tough on this tariff, doesn't know what he's doing, but you'll pay the price. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=581.2s)]
*  Tens of millions of people lose healthcare coverage. That means everybody's going to pay more. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=586.0s)]
*  These things matter. I guess the other thing I'd make on the strong leader thing, there's a really [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=589.2800000000001s)]
*  important part of this for Trump. And this is where your listeners can help share content, ads, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=594.0s)]
*  interviews, where Trump seems unstable because the argument is, listen, he's the oldest person [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=599.12s)]
*  ever to seek this office. He's clearly not as stable as he was. And he wasn't particularly [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=605.5200000000001s)]
*  stable back then. He won't have anybody around him to stop him. Okay. Like Laura Loomer, Marjorie [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=610.56s)]
*  Taroller-Green, these are the people he listens to. Project 2025 gives him no guardrails. And [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=618.16s)]
*  you know, the goal here is sort of absolute and unchecked power. And that scares voters. So when [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=625.28s)]
*  we think about messages against Trump, there's economic messages for sure about how he's going [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=631.8399999999999s)]
*  to screw working people and take care of the wealthy and hurt our overall economy. Like every [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=636.56s)]
*  economist who's looked at his plan says it will increase inflation, blow up the deficit, and add [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=641.52s)]
*  cost to middle-class people. It's like a trifecta of terribleness. Healthcare and abortion, clearly [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=647.52s)]
*  huge contrast. But this leadership thing about just imagine him basically unstable with no [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=653.4399999999999s)]
*  guardrails, with unchecked power, to not do anything to help you, but to seek revenge is really, really [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=660.8s)]
*  important. And that's not just like a cable TV thing. Voters get it. Are we going to see more of [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=666.32s)]
*  that in your advertising? I know most of the ads to date have been positive about Kamala or just [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=671.5200000000001s)]
*  or contrast on her bio, the economy, and some immigration stuff. I know you have this ad running [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=676.0s)]
*  with Olivia Troy and some former Trump people that is related to sort of his response to the hurricane. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=682.48s)]
*  Are we going to see more of that sort of like go big picture contrast with Trump on instability? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=688.32s)]
*  Some of the advertising, and this is not a critique of it, but could be run against a normal [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=693.76s)]
*  Republican. Trump's obviously not a normal Republican. Is there an effort to maybe raise the stakes down [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=697.92s)]
*  the stretch here? Well, I think some of our most effective ads have been on abortion, have been on [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=702.24s)]
*  women's healthcare, have been on healthcare generally. The ACA, we ran a really important ad, I think, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=706.8s)]
*  coming out of the debate on that, that tested really well and got great response to it. And that's [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=711.6s)]
*  unique to Trump. What's interesting, of course, is most Republicans aren't talking about ripping [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=716.16s)]
*  up the ACA. This is kind of unique to Trump. And since he tried to do it 60 times, we can believe [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=720.4s)]
*  he'll do it again. You know, we've got an ad on the air now with national security officials, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=725.04s)]
*  you know, talking about his former national security advisors, his defense secretaries warning that [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=729.4399999999999s)]
*  he's not fit to lead, that he's unstable. So that'll be part of the argument. I think what you have [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=734.8s)]
*  to do is we all have to raise the risk of a Trump second term. Some of that's policy risk, what he [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=738.88s)]
*  would do to the economy. Some of that's on abortion, nationwide abortion ban, appointing more [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=744.48s)]
*  conservative Supreme Court justices, ripping healthcare away from hundreds of millions of [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=749.04s)]
*  people in this country. But it's also on this leadership and this character. So that it'll be [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=753.1999999999999s)]
*  part of the mix going forward for sure. When you and I used to work together, you used to [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=759.04s)]
*  describe a presidential race as a series of governor's races in the battleground states. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=762.9599999999999s)]
*  Is that still how you see it? Even though politics is much more national now, there's not the local [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=768.16s)]
*  media is less important than it used to be. Trump clearly thinks it's national because he's doing [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=772.8s)]
*  events at Coachella and Madison Square Garden. But how do you sort of see that interplay between [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=776.56s)]
*  a localized race and the national political trends? Well, sure, there's no borders anymore, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=781.3599999999999s)]
*  or maybe never, but particularly now. But let's be clear, Trump's doing this one. He's a New York [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=786.0s)]
*  guy at heart, and I'm sure he's always wanted to play the garden. Could be his last chance, I guess. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=791.28s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure there'll be echoes to what the famous rally that was held there in the mid 30s [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=795.3599999999999s)]
*  we'll see. But I think he's also starting to have pretty poor crowds in these battleground states. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=800.0s)]
*  So I think the act is getting a little tired in these states, so he's going out. So I think the [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=807.04s)]
*  way we look at it is that's why you do national interviews, whether it's Call Her Daddy or Stephen [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=812.56s)]
*  Colbert or other podcasts that we're going to do. Those are not based in battleground states. They [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=817.76s)]
*  reach battleground states. I think where it's a governor's race is your schedule has to be really [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=824.56s)]
*  smart. Your obviously operational organization has to be very intensive. And then local media, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=828.0s)]
*  particularly local television, still matters a great deal. But it is particularly true around [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=833.36s)]
*  the operation, and it's hard because you're not running in one state. You're a national campaign. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=839.04s)]
*  And even though there's been races historically where there was more battleground states, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=844.16s)]
*  there are seven. It's a lot. So you've got to make the doors you're knocking, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=848.4s)]
*  the ground game, the surrogate game. That all is still very state-specific. But it's a presidential [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=855.12s)]
*  campaign as a blend of what happens nationally because voters tend to see big moments nationally [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=862.8s)]
*  and process them. But also they want to see you show up in their town and talk to local reporters. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=867.28s)]
*  But more than anything else is to have people who represent your campaign in the community, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=872.64s)]
*  knocking on doors, being out there trying to convince people to vote. So I think definitely [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=877.28s)]
*  the national overlay, that's always been the case. I think it has intensified with the way people get [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=882.3199999999999s)]
*  information. But I still think at the end of the day, listen, you know this, it's always humbling [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=887.8399999999999s)]
*  when you're a campaign professional, when you tell people how little the campaign matters. Meaning, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=892.32s)]
*  a good campaign is not going to turn a 54 or 46 loss into a win. It's impossible. But if you have [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=897.7600000000001s)]
*  the best campaign on the ground and you think you execute best against your goals, it can give you [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=903.6800000000001s)]
*  a half a point or a point, which of course this race very well could come down to. So that's what [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=908.1600000000001s)]
*  you're doing all this for basically. There's a lot of concern out there among folks about the [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=914.5600000000001s)]
*  possibility of another polling error where the polls are underestimating Trump's support. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=920.56s)]
*  I mean, the public polls were way off in 2020, but even the Biden campaign polls were data was off [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=927.5999999999999s)]
*  in the sense that he was campaigning in Ohio and Iowa at the very end there. And those states ended [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=932.0799999999999s)]
*  up performing just like they did in 2016. How are you guys thinking about that? Have you adjusted [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=937.5999999999999s)]
*  sort of your modeling or your polling to try to ensure you don't have a similar situation this [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=944.0799999999999s)]
*  time? Right. So I'd say I wasn't a part of the campaign in 20 neither were you, but I think their [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=949.04s)]
*  data was much better than the public polls. That's why they weren't going to Florida and Texas, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=954.64s)]
*  for instance, because they didn't see a pathway, even though public polls were suggesting that it [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=959.36s)]
*  was essentially tie. So we spent a lot of time on this. I think the lesson you'll learn, because of [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=963.68s)]
*  course, you know, Republicans were, their strength was overrated in 2022. 18 was probably a blend. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=970.32s)]
*  So I think what you want to do is make sure that you're being very conservative. And I think we [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=980.8000000000001s)]
*  are. So I don't think we're sitting here with internal data showing a really tight race where [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=985.2800000000001s)]
*  we'd rather be us than Trump. And it's based on undercounting either his vote share among certain [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=990.48s)]
*  demographics or his turnout. I think we've all learned that lesson. So, but I'd say a couple [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=996.48s)]
*  things. One is, I think Kamala Harris may surprise at the end of the day with either straight up [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1001.52s)]
*  Republicans or independents or essentially Republicans. We're seeing continued strength [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1008.08s)]
*  there. And that matters a great deal, given how big those cohorts are. So, you know, and we're [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1013.9200000000001s)]
*  being conservative there as well. We're not overstating our numbers internally, but I think [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1020.64s)]
*  you see the leading edge of things that could be quite positive. And then again, I think Trump is [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1024.56s)]
*  just incredibly reliant on voters who've either never voted before, haven't voted a long time, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1028.32s)]
*  never voted Republican. So, you know, that's a big challenge. You know, as we look at the race, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1034.1599999999999s)]
*  we give him credit for doing a good job there because my view on Trump basically to break it [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1040.6399999999999s)]
*  down is, you know, if you think he's going to get a hundred votes in a precinct, you probably just [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1044.72s)]
*  assume he gets 110. So, you can win a race where he overperforms. So, I really can't speak to the [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1049.2s)]
*  public polls. I spend very little time looking at them. I just don't. And most of them are horseshit. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1054.8s)]
*  You know, some of them may be close, but generally I'd say any poll that shows Kamala Harris up [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1062.0s)]
*  four to five points in one of these seven states, ignore it. Any point that shows Donald Trump up [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1066.4s)]
*  like that, ignore it. This thing's very close. It's a margin of error race. But again, I'd rather [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1070.24s)]
*  be us than him because I think we have the ability to get to 49 and a half or 50, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1075.2s)]
*  a much more confident about that than Donald Trump, but it's going to be close all the way. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1081.52s)]
*  And so I think we're doing what we can to be conservative in the data. And obviously, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1084.72s)]
*  you know, we're a campaign that has a bunch of different sources of data as we did in the Obama [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1091.68s)]
*  days. You know, you have traditional polling where traditional pollsters are calling, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1096.24s)]
*  you know, six or 800 people. Some of that's calling, some of that's online panels, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1101.04s)]
*  but we're also doing the larger data sets, you know, where you have a larger amount of respondents. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1105.2s)]
*  And that's always good because not only do you have a little more confidence in the overall numbers, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1112.72s)]
*  but then you've got enough respondents so you can really look under the hood at different ethnicities, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1116.96s)]
*  different age, you know, education to make sure that we think all that makes sense. But, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1120.8s)]
*  but, you know, listen, I think it may be that our internal data is exactly right. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1126.88s)]
*  But if I were to hazard a guess, I think it may be undercounting her strength amongst Republican [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1132.96s)]
*  leaning independence. So we won't put that in the bank, but let's hope that's right. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1138.48s)]
*  Are you guys projecting turnout at around 2020 levels? And do you think the electorate looks [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1143.44s)]
*  similar? I guess that's sort of been the baseline everyone's using is 2020 was almost essentially [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1148.56s)]
*  a tie race. You lose a point with one group from Biden's 2020 numbers, then you're losing. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1152.32s)]
*  And if you gain a point and you're ahead, but obviously a lot changes in four years. And this [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1156.8s)]
*  was a pretty tumultuous four years. And we have obviously a very different candidate in Kamala [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1161.2s)]
*  Harris. How much is the electorate the same or different do you think from 2020 in terms of [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1166.3999999999999s)]
*  turnout and composition? Well, I think the competition, obviously you'll have, you know, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1170.1599999999999s)]
*  more younger voters as a percentage of it, just as people age into the electorate and people age [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1175.12s)]
*  out of the electorate. But I think that, you know, turnout is the hardest thing for any campaign to [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1181.6s)]
*  predict. So obviously you can, you've got historical data, you've got polling. So you're asking people [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1186.9599999999998s)]
*  whether they're going to vote or not. You draw some conclusions based on that. We're beginning [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1193.4399999999998s)]
*  to get early vote data in who's requested ballots, who sent them back in, you know, in a lot of states [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1197.36s)]
*  within 10, 12 days, we'll have people voting in person early. So that's really when you begin to [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1203.4399999999998s)]
*  get a sense of how many people who are first time voters are showing up in that early vote universe. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1208.24s)]
*  How many of them, you know, didn't vote in 20? How many of them are people who voted in 20 but not in [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1213.2s)]
*  22? So I think right now our assumption is it's going to be, you know, in the 2020 range. Obviously [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1219.1200000000001s)]
*  in the Biden Trump race, I think the belief is it would have been a lot lower, maybe as low as 140 [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1226.48s)]
*  million. This is a more interesting race to people. I think that Kamala Harris has created a lot of [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1230.72s)]
*  energy on our side. The enthusiasm gap has obviously been eroded that Trump had in 2024 1.0 [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1235.76s)]
*  campaign. So, but as we look at it, obviously, we're trying to make sure that what would it take to [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1243.68s)]
*  win if national turnout's 145, 150, 155, 160, 162? And again, the one thing that I think is pretty [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1249.68s)]
*  constant, and I think most observers of this would agree, sort of neutral observers, they're [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1256.32s)]
*  handful that you could really trust to have smart both data and take on this, is his sort of base of [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1262.48s)]
*  foundation is built on a rickety element, which is all of these people who don't have vote history, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1270.8s)]
*  who may say in a poll they're going to vote. But as you and I know, that's the toughest thing to do [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1279.84s)]
*  in politics is to get that cohort all the way through the funnel. It's weird hearing you and [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1283.28s)]
*  I have this conversation about Trump because this is the argument people made against Obama [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1288.48s)]
*  in 08. But the difference here is we, and you in particular, understood that and then built a [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1291.68s)]
*  massive field operation to account for that challenge. And that's something that based on [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1297.8400000000001s)]
*  all the reports, Trump is not done. No, it's a very decentralized and listen, you know, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1302.8s)]
*  we believe in empowering people, right? So if people want to go and organize on their own, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1307.04s)]
*  that's amazing. But I do think it's pretty light given where this race stands, which is, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1310.64s)]
*  he cannot win unless he does, I think, a pretty extraordinary job of turning out that cohort. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1319.04s)]
*  Now, we obviously have, maybe we're less reliant on that, but it's still incredibly important. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1325.04s)]
*  Obviously, we've got massive turnout needs and challenges in our base, you know, of every, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1330.48s)]
*  you know, type of voter and got to max that out. So, but we like what we're seeing in the early [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1337.28s)]
*  vote data so far. We particularly like what we're not seeing on the Trump data, which is there's not [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1342.72s)]
*  an army of kind of incels showing up in early voting history. So, you know, maybe they'll show [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1347.04s)]
*  up on election day, we'll see. But so far, there's not a leading edge that that's something crazy is [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1353.52s)]
*  afoot there. Last question for you. You know, you the Harris campaign has put pushed really hard for [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1358.96s)]
*  debate. You accepted debates, you challenged him to debates. Last night, Trump said he was not doing [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1365.44s)]
*  a debate. He's also as of the recording of this not yet really accepted the CNN town hall. Just [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1371.28s)]
*  what's your reaction to his refusal to debate and how, if at all, this affects your campaign [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1376.16s)]
*  strategy going forward? Well, Dan, I could spend three hours talking about what's going on here [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1380.0800000000002s)]
*  with the psychology. I mean, I think what's clear is his campaign know what's happening. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1384.64s)]
*  They knew what happened in the first debate. They don't want him to debate again. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1389.3600000000001s)]
*  I also think they see his rallies, which are like a disaster. And, you know, what's interesting to [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1393.52s)]
*  me is, you know, we've used some of his rally footage in ads, we'll do more of that. But when [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1401.28s)]
*  we do particularly qualitative research with swing voters or voters that aren't sure if they're [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1404.96s)]
*  going to vote, a lot of this stuff, you know, they see it. That's the world we live in, right? Somebody [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1408.8s)]
*  shares some crazy thing he said. Like, by the way, the thing he said that, you know, Joe Biden [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1414.64s)]
*  became mentally impaired, Kamala Harris was born that way. A lot of voters saw it and a lot of [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1419.8400000000001s)]
*  voters didn't like it. You know, that speaks to the both lack of character and instability. So I [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1424.32s)]
*  think his campaign sees how he's performing. You know, yes, on the debate stage, but around that, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1429.68s)]
*  they want to keep him off. I think whether he generally believes he won the debate or not, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1435.1200000000001s)]
*  I tend to think he's convinced himself he did. There's got to be in some, you know, the dark [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1439.52s)]
*  addled recesses of that brain, some kind of subconscious understanding that he doesn't want [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1446.48s)]
*  to get humiliated. So I'm not even sure he'll do the CNN debate. He's rescheduled Univision for [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1451.6000000000001s)]
*  next week. Kamala Harris is doing it. We're talking on Thursday, today from Nevada. We'll see. I [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1457.2s)]
*  wouldn't be surprised if he bails on that. I mean, he might just want to stay basically in his [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1462.88s)]
*  safe space from now to the end. But we're going to, you know, we're continuing, you know, as you've [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1466.88s)]
*  seen, you've commented about this very smartly. Like the world has changed. The way you reach [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1472.64s)]
*  voters, even from when we work together has changed a lot. And, you know, some of that's [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1476.4s)]
*  direct interaction. Some of that's putting out content that maybe people who worked in politics [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1482.0s)]
*  in the 1980s don't understand, but somebody who's a 22-year-old likes and will share and will use it [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1485.84s)]
*  to get motivated. So we're going to keep doing that. And, you know, we've had an active week this week. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1491.4399999999998s)]
*  They'll keep building on that just to reach these voters because there are, you know, people who [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1496.8799999999999s)]
*  generally know they're going to vote, they have a plan to vote, right? And people who've decided [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1501.84s)]
*  who to vote, you know, they're probably going to vote earlier. You know, they're there, have checked [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1508.0s)]
*  into the race for months. But this last group of people who aren't sure whether they're going to [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1512.56s)]
*  vote or who they're going to vote for, you know, the delta between what they know about this race [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1516.8799999999999s)]
*  and positions and Kamala Harris and Donald Trump and the rest of the electorate is pretty far. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1522.96s)]
*  You know, they see stuff. So we want to make sure that we're in their feeds or we're in their [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1526.96s)]
*  podcasts or, you know, we're advertising in smart ways so that at that moment where they be making [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1531.36s)]
*  a decision about whether to vote or who to vote for, we're putting our best foot forward. And [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1537.6s)]
*  obviously the ground game is part of that as well. Trusted people from the community making the case [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1541.76s)]
*  is incredibly important. So I, you know, I think that we're not going to get the debate with Donald [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1546.0s)]
*  Trump, I don't think. So that moment is not going to be there. So we can bemoan that or we can just [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1550.96s)]
*  deal with it like adults and say, okay, what's plan B? And plan B is, I think, to be everywhere [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1557.28s)]
*  we can in smart ways and make the case about who would be a better president for the next four [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1563.52s)]
*  years. Because that's really where voters are. I mean, Bill Clinton famously said elections are [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1569.28s)]
*  about the future and they are. And I think we've got a decisive advantage on who do people think [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1572.96s)]
*  has best plans for the future. By the way, who understands the future? Who would be a more stable [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1578.56s)]
*  leader on women's healthcare? Massive advantage on healthcare, generally massive advantage on some of [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1583.84s)]
*  these economic questions around fighting for like you advantage. So we just got to continue to press [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1589.36s)]
*  that case. But Democrats and those that are helping, because this is a big coalition, Democrats and [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1593.76s)]
*  independents, Republicans, people you and I used to square off with are in the tent now. This is [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1599.04s)]
*  going to be really close. I mean, Donald Trump's going to get 48% of the vote everywhere, maybe [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1604.24s)]
*  48 and a half. We just got to get more than that. And I think we've got a plan and an ability and [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1609.76s)]
*  a candidate to do that. But that's just the reality. I think we'd all like it to be easier [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1615.2s)]
*  than it is, but it's not going to be. That's not the country we live in. It's very divided. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1619.04s)]
*  And Trump obviously has some appeal that other Republican candidates don't have. He also has [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1624.72s)]
*  some weaknesses that we're exploiting, you know, I think particularly with suburban voters and [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1630.16s)]
*  suburban women. David Plouffe, great to talk to you. Good luck out there. It's going to be a crazy [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1634.24s)]
*  few weeks. And it was great to hear what you had to say here. Crooked's mission has created an [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1640.0800000000002s)]
*  honest conversation about news, politics and the world around us. Seven years ago, John, John and [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1644.3200000000002s)]
*  Tommy founded this company because after working in politics for years and years and years, they [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1649.92s)]
*  saw that there was something absolutely missing in political media. There was not media that [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1653.52s)]
*  didn't just tell us what was happening, but what we could do about it. And so no matter who wins [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1657.92s)]
*  in 2024, Crooked is going to remain committed to that mission, but we can't do it without your help. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1662.08s)]
*  And to put it simply, building the shows initiatives that we envision for 2025 requires [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1667.36s)]
*  people, time and resources. And the best way to support us is to sign up for an annual membership [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1671.92s)]
*  to our friends at the pod subscription services. The best way to support us as we make shows and [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1676.6399999999999s)]
*  launch new projects. There's one thing this election has told us is that the right-wing [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1680.32s)]
*  media ecosystem has never been more powerful. Crooked exists to counterbalance the Fox news [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1683.84s)]
*  and daily wires of the world. And here's some great news. There's never been a better time to [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1688.1599999999999s)]
*  support Crooked media than right now. Friends of the pod is offering 25% off new annual memberships [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1692.72s)]

*  well relative to circumstances. That's really all you can ask for these days because I've talked to [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1797.84s)]
*  a lot of people who are not doing great. That is good. Every hopefully thoughtful conversation [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1802.32s)]
*  about the Latino vote must begin with the stipulation that the Latino vote is not a [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1808.24s)]
*  monolith. It is incredibly diverse. People with different backgrounds, ideological preferences, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1811.52s)]
*  different family histories, geographic diversity, etc. We're going to stipulate [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1816.08s)]
*  that for a second. When you were on the wilderness with John Favreau a few months ago, which now I [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1820.8799999999999s)]
*  think feels like an eternity ago given we had a different candidate back then, I'm pretty sure, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1825.12s)]
*  you said something that I thought was a good way to set the table for this conversation, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1829.84s)]
*  which is the Latinos are not a monolith, but they are a group. Can you maybe explain what that means? [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1834.0s)]
*  Absolutely. There are great divisions within the Latino electorate. In great part because [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1840.24s)]
*  the Latino community is really a political project. When you are living in your own life, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1846.7199999999998s)]
*  you tend to identify based on your own nationality, especially if you grow up a place that is very [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1851.4399999999998s)]
*  Latino like Los Angeles or parts of Texas or Miami like I did or in New York where I grew up saying [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1857.28s)]
*  I'm Cuban and your friend would say they were Colombian or they were Mexican or what have you. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1862.9599999999998s)]
*  But the rest of American politics and society tends to put you in this one bucket and you learn [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1867.04s)]
*  quickly where you fit. It's kind of the high school cafeteria metaphor we use, which is you walk in [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1873.04s)]
*  and you say, well, I don't sit at that table. I don't sit at that table. I guess I sit with these [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1877.9199999999998s)]
*  kids. But there are great divisions that are based on country of origin, based on geography, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1880.72s)]
*  based on language that you speak. Some people have been in this country for 13 generations. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1887.6s)]
*  Some are immigrants or the children of immigrants. And yet the movement we have seen in the Trump era [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1893.04s)]
*  cuts across all of those divisions because there is still a commonality in terms of how you are [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1900.6399999999999s)]
*  perceived in this country and that's how you perceive yourself and your interests in the [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1906.1599999999999s)]
*  context of an election. And that movement, when it cuts across, is it cutting across on educational [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1910.1599999999999s)]
*  lines, ideological lines? Help us unpack that. Excellent question because I do think there's [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1916.08s)]
*  a little bit of a square peg round hole, or whichever way that goes, happening here when [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1921.76s)]
*  it comes to education because education is such a meaningful cleavage among white voters, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1928.32s)]
*  non-college white, college white, worlds apart, that people now try to apply it in the non-white [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1934.0s)]
*  context. And to some extent it works, but not for the reasons people think. At least 70% of registered [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1939.92s)]
*  Latinos are non-college. Among the population overall it's something like 85%. It is such a [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1947.28s)]
*  large chunk of the electorate that it obscures anything that's happening underneath. The reality [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1952.8799999999999s)]
*  is if you don't have a college education, you're less likely to be partisan. You're less likely to [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1957.6s)]
*  be following politics or very aware of the ins and outs of politics in a way that the swingier voters [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1962.16s)]
*  live in the non-college bucket. So you would expect them to be the first to move, whether that's [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1970.16s)]
*  about class or not is a separate question. Some part of it is about class, but it hurts the [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1976.48s)]
*  conversation to oversimplify. Ideology in some ways is way more interesting because a lot of what we [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1982.48s)]
*  saw in 2020 was conservatives essentially going back to their, or for the first time, to their true [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1988.72s)]
*  quote unquote political home. Where racial polarization comes into play is that you have [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=1996.08s)]
*  Latinos, Black voters, AAPI voters who identify as conservative but couldn't vote for Republicans, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2001.2s)]
*  didn't feel like they belonged with the Republican party and were voting for Democrats because they [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2007.1200000000001s)]
*  thought Democrats were looking out better for their interests. That's still by the way the case [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2011.92s)]
*  to date even after movement. And yet those were the first people to move, were people whose ideology [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2016.32s)]
*  and vote choice had previously not matched, but now we're moving toward Donald Trump. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2022.16s)]
*  Were some of these folks were people who were identified as conservative but were voting for [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2025.76s)]
*  Democrats because voting for a Republican was a bridge too far? Or were some of them people who [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2030.16s)]
*  were conservative identifying Latinos who simply weren't voting because they could not bring [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2035.0400000000002s)]
*  themselves a vote for a Republican? That's the right question. It's both. You had some who were [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2040.4s)]
*  voting with Democrats. It was basically socially unacceptable to vote for Republicans. And so many [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2045.6000000000001s)]
*  of them did vote for, especially in the Obama years, voted for Barack Obama. Many voted for [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2052.7200000000003s)]
*  Hillary Clinton, but many others sat it out. Couldn't vote for the Republican, but couldn't [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2058.08s)]
*  also stomach voting for the Democrat either. And it's a lot of those who Trump appeals to. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2065.04s)]
*  And so one of the big questions as far as where the Latino vote falls is whether some of the more [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2070.64s)]
*  Trumpian element among an irregular voting Latino actually turns out for Donald Trump in the way a [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2075.04s)]
*  white working class male Trump voter came out of the woodwork in a 16 or a 20. I should say [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2080.96s)]
*  today still about 25% of conservative Latinos are still voting for Kamala Harris. That's a big chunk. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2090.64s)]
*  That said, for Biden, it was probably 35% of conservative Latinos. And then in past [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2098.2400000000002s)]
*  elections, it was higher than that. And so we do see some of the erosion. And a big part of that is, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2103.92s)]
*  though, the open question of who at the end of the day turns out or doesn't. That's where a lot of [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2109.68s)]
*  the dynamism is coming from in this election. So Hillary Clinton did very well historically [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2113.6s)]
*  with Latinos. Donald Trump then does incredibly well for a Republican. He makes gains over those [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2118.8799999999997s)]
*  four years. What have you found as to what he did over that four year period when, I think the [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2123.68s)]
*  general sense was, he had these cruel and racist immigration policies. He said horribly racist [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2130.08s)]
*  things. He said that if I would not see all these things that you would on paper at least suspect [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2136.56s)]
*  would further polarize the Latino vote against him, but it worked in the exact opposite direction. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2141.12s)]
*  Help unpack that mystery for us. Yeah. And the way to understand this is you have [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2150.0s)]
*  Hillary Clinton gets per catalyst 71% of the Latino vote in 2016. So you have 71-29. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2157.04s)]
*  You then have this change to Biden where it's 62-38. So Trump goes from 29 to 38. Where we find [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2167.6s)]
*  ourselves today, if the election were today, is that it would probably be closer to 60-40. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2177.28s)]
*  We're hovering around 60-40. One of the big questions we can talk about is whether Trump [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2182.8s)]
*  crosses the 40% line or falls below it. That's the game of inches that's getting played right now. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2186.96s)]
*  But to an earlier point you made, all we're going to be debating right now is essentially about [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2192.5600000000004s)]
*  somewhere between 3% and 8% of Latinos. Of course, this is what you sign up for when you talk about [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2197.6000000000004s)]
*  elections. We're talking about a very small sliver of voters, but they're the ones who are most [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2204.88s)]
*  critical to election results at the end of the day. They are also the ones among whom polling is [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2210.32s)]
*  least equipped to give us a very accurate read at any given point. But I wanted to contextualize that [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2215.92s)]
*  we're talking about a small number of people at the end of the day. What Trump did well, so to speak, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2223.04s)]
*  between those years is you had a set of factors here. The biggest was that the economy came to [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2228.4s)]
*  overwhelm all other considerations. COVID was a very, very big factor here. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2235.12s)]
*  So in the midst of COVID, people's priorities shifted. I described the kind of conservative [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2240.72s)]
*  Latino who in the past couldn't bring themselves to vote for a Republican, who at the end of the [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2247.52s)]
*  day said, well, all these concerns I have, I'm going to put them aside because if my one [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2252.64s)]
*  consideration is who is going to be better for me and my family when it comes to the economy [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2258.64s)]
*  then for this one set of sliver of economically conservative Latinos, Donald Trump was the answer. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2264.48s)]
*  An election was going to be a referendum on who is better for the economy. Trump, the businessman, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2269.28s)]
*  whose businessman persona still carried a lot of appeal, still does today, [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2273.92s)]
*  was going to win out at the end of the day. And that's essentially what you saw happen. And I [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2279.36s)]
*  think to some extent, we are still dealing with the repercussions of COVID era politics, a lot of [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2282.96s)]
*  what we saw. Where conservative Latinos were most approving of the Trump agenda was in, quote, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2288.7200000000003s)]
*  reopening the economy, concerns that Biden was going to shut things down, was in living without [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2293.4399999999996s)]
*  fear of COVID. And so that dynamic that you saw play out most dramatically in Florida, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2299.12s)]
*  you see some aspects of it also in a place like Nevada, where you have an economy dependent on [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2303.52s)]
*  the service industry, on tourism that was rocked so heavily in the midst of the pandemic. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2308.48s)]
*  Yeah, no, that's a great answer. I mean, this is obviously one of the great political questions of [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2313.68s)]
*  our time to figure out for sociological reasons, but also for Democrats to figure out how we [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2318.56s)]
*  reverse these trends. Because as you and I have talked about before, the math for winning 200 [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2323.6s)]
*  electoral votes gets really hard if these numbers keep moving even a few points in the wrong [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2328.96s)]
*  direction. We run out of voters. And actually, the way to understand that is if you took all of the [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2333.68s)]
*  same dynamics from Arizona in 2020, the electorate stays the same in terms of who votes, in terms of [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2338.24s)]
*  support levels, and you drop Latino support by one point, Joe Biden loses Arizona in 2020. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2344.4s)]
*  I mean, the margins are so narrow. And then if you were losing voters with the fastest growing [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2351.44s)]
*  population in states, that is not a game you want to play, right? It's how we went from [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2356.4s)]
*  great optimism about Texas to less optimism about Texas these days. Coming out of 2012 and 2016, [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2362.2400000000002s)]
*  Texas seemed like it was on an inexorable path towards being a blue state. And it's in the same [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2370.7999999999997s)]
*  place for the last couple of elections because we are losing ground with the fastest growing [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2376.0s)]
*  group of voters. But let's get back to the overall numbers here. Because as you said, and I assume [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2381.68s)]
*  this is what you guys are seeing your polling, that Kamala Harris is sort of right around, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2386.48s)]
*  or at least maybe in spitting distance of Biden's 2020 numbers. Is that right? [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2390.88s)]
*  She's just a few points shy. That's right. And so she's got to make up those points or [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2395.36s)]
*  find other voters somewhere else, basically. That's right. You have, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2399.76s)]
*  Biden was essentially 62-38. In an average of polls over the last month, you're looking at 57-38. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2405.2000000000003s)]
*  Our poll was 54-38. So in both cases, you have Harris struggling to get past 60, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2413.92s)]
*  Trump struggling to get past 40. But it's shrunken down to where it's a game of these last few [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2419.5200000000004s)]
*  inches. You're seeing a lot of stability otherwise, except for this last little morsel [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2426.08s)]
*  of the electorate that's left. Do you have a sense of who that last morsel is? [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2432.3199999999997s)]
*  Yes. So it is slightly more male, but not in a way that is overwhelming, I would say. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2436.96s)]
*  And I should say, the number of undecideds is small and has stayed small. We also include, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2446.56s)]
*  when we talk about persuadable voters, people who have chosen a side but don't seem entirely set, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2452.0s)]
*  which still only gets you to 7% to 8% of registered Latinos. So we're talking a small [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2456.56s)]
*  piece here. They do tend to be more married than the electorate overall. It gives you an indication, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2461.52s)]
*  actually, like some of the most movement we've seen with voters who are 30 to 49. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2467.6s)]
*  So it's exactly the kind of voter who was around in the Obama years, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2473.04s)]
*  but didn't get pulled off the sidelines in those elections. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2476.4s)]
*  And so people who are kind of stuck in the middle, they do actually tend to speak Spanish, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2479.36s)]
*  more than the overall electorate, despite some stereotypes to the opposite. They tend to consume [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2482.8s)]
*  media more in Spanish. They tend to be getting news from YouTube more than the electorate overall. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2488.7200000000003s)]
*  So it's not a clear profile other than to say it's kind of the least partisan element of the [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2495.2000000000003s)]
*  electorate. It's who you would expect would be persuadable in this moment in time. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2500.7200000000003s)]
*  In this moment in time. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2506.16s)]
*  It's pretty close to the remaining undecided group of white voters, black voters, young voters. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2507.44s)]
*  That's sort of what we're fighting over, right? People who get their news from YouTube. That's [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2513.28s)]
*  what we're fighting over right now. The people we talk to least. Yeah, that's right. It's like the [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2518.4s)]
*  great paradox, right? The people we most need to talk to are the ones that are hardest to talk to. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2522.24s)]
*  In 2022, we saw sort of a split in how the, quote unquote, battleground states [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2527.6s)]
*  performed, like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia, and then what we saw in California and [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2533.44s)]
*  New York. And I'm speaking broadly, not just Latino vote here, where we saw Democratic [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2537.92s)]
*  underperformance. Are you seeing any differences between Latino engagement or performance in [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2541.04s)]
*  sort of not just Arizona and Nevada, but also the pockets of Latinos in Pennsylvania, Michigan, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2547.6s)]
*  Wisconsin, than in sort of the broader national electorate? There is always state variation. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2552.08s)]
*  So when I give these national numbers, of course, some states are a little bit above that line. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2557.6s)]
*  Some are below that line. Also, what Harris needs to win in those states is going to differ. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2561.28s)]
*  So again, Arizona, the margins are much tighter. Can't afford to lose very much. Whereas in Nevada, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2566.4s)]
*  because of a changing electorate, there's more wiggle room. But largely speaking, though, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2571.6800000000003s)]
*  it's not in the polling, at least, what the dynamic we saw in 2022, meaning the movement [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2576.6400000000003s)]
*  does seem to shift up and down kind of evenly. Even I should say in Florida, even though the [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2582.8s)]
*  levels in Florida are much worse for Democrats, the in cycle movement has been equivalent to [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2586.72s)]
*  what we're seeing everywhere else. What are the best messages that Democrats should be using with [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2593.3599999999997s)]
*  this last group of Latino voters here? From our last poll, there was this dynamic that I think is [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2599.2799999999997s)]
*  so fascinating. And you've seen it bear out in other polling more broadly for the electorate. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2606.72s)]
*  When you ask who is better for the US economy among Latino voters in battleground states, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2611.28s)]
*  Trump has a three point advantage. Generically speaking, Trump, the businessman, still is [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2617.0400000000004s)]
*  trusted better on the economy. When you ask who is better for middle and working class families, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2623.84s)]
*  it's plus 21 Harris. When you ask who cares more about people like you, it's plus 26 Harris. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2630.7200000000003s)]
*  And so there is this tug of war, right? Where if it's a generic question of who I think is going [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2637.04s)]
*  to be better on the economy, Trump has a little bit of an advantage. When you bring it down [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2642.48s)]
*  and ground it in specific people, is he going to think about you when it comes time to make [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2647.68s)]
*  decisions? You see Harris's advantage open up or get exploited. And so a lot of this is not a [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2652.72s)]
*  mystery. A lot of this is not rocket science. Frankly, it's like a lot of blocking and tackling [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2660.16s)]
*  dam that we've always been talking about. Her economic agenda is very popular, even among [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2664.8s)]
*  the Latinos who say that Trump would be better on the economy. Majorities of people who say Trump [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2670.6400000000003s)]
*  would be better on the economy strongly support all of her main planks of her opportunity agenda, [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2676.48s)]
*  whether it's expanding child tax credits, whether it's expanded opportunities for first time [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2684.6400000000003s)]
*  homeowners, whether it's expanded childcare, all incredibly popular, even among people who think [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2689.12s)]
*  generically that Trump would be better. So a lot of this is just about reassuring voters who have [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2695.52s)]
*  frankly been rocked by rising prices, that Harris gets it, that Harris is going to be fighting for [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2700.3199999999997s)]
*  them, that she's not some loony radical who's out of touch with their lives and their priorities. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2707.92s)]
*  And so a lot of that is just for showing up, frankly. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2715.04s)]
*  And this right, Trump's running on mass deportation. He's threatening to pull TPS status from people [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2719.2s)]
*  who are in this country legally wants to shut down the border is the common, I think, largely [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2725.3599999999997s)]
*  naive narrative is that would be very bad in the Latino community. But that was much more complicated [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2732.08s)]
*  than that. So maybe you could talk a little bit about the interplay of immigration, border security, [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2736.24s)]
*  comprehensive immigration reform and the overall Latino vote. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2741.44s)]
*  Yeah, look, Latinos like all Americans want order at the border. There was this period of time [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2744.0s)]
*  in the midst of the Biden term, where it felt like we were getting rocked by crisis after crisis. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2754.32s)]
*  It was rising prices. It was the border, as it was depicted in the news, migrants arriving in big [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2760.72s)]
*  cities. You had wars breaking out over the place. And then a sense, whether fair or not, [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2769.52s)]
*  that Biden did not have the vitality to handle these crises. And so in that context, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2774.4s)]
*  the border was very damaging among a conservative kind of Latino. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2781.68s)]
*  I think the Harris campaign has run in actually a very good Latino campaign. They have run a very [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2787.36s)]
*  smart Latino outreach effort. If there's one thing I think it's missing, it is the contrast [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2792.56s)]
*  on the other side of immigration. They've done a good job on the border piece in the sense of [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2799.52s)]
*  turning the table and saying, well, look, we had a bipartisan border bill and Trump killed it. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2806.7999999999997s)]
*  He's not actually looking for solutions. But there is this contrast on what do you do about [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2810.08s)]
*  somebody who has been here 20 years and is married to an American citizen and American kids [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2814.4s)]
*  that has been entirely absent from the debate and literally from the debates that get asked about [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2818.9599999999996s)]
*  the border and it hasn't come up. And in the broader campaign and in the ad traffic that [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2825.9199999999996s)]
*  you've seen to date, there's a big difference in how the campaigns would treat someone who [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2830.0s)]
*  has been living and working here for decades. The Harris and Biden proposal was to keep families [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2836.9599999999996s)]
*  together. The Biden, the Trump proposal is to deport those very same people. It is an incredible [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2843.6s)]
*  contrast, by the way, moves even non-Latinos because again, it speaks to a different part [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2849.2799999999997s)]
*  of immigration that speaks to democratic strengths. And so people like a balanced both and approach [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2854.7999999999997s)]
*  to immigration. Ideally, that would be part of the conversation because it does bring back some of [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2861.04s)]
*  the traditional partisan lines, the lines in the sand that we saw among Latinos. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2867.44s)]
*  This is something I've been mystified by because the polling on it seems actually pretty clear [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2872.16s)]
*  that when you raise the stakes, you make it about solving the whole problem. We have advantages. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2876.16s)]
*  When you focus on just the border, you're only playing defense. And you're playing- [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2881.12s)]
*  We're going to lose a fight on the border. That's right. We're never going to win a fight on the [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2884.56s)]
*  border alone. Right. Yeah. And so I just, I, and that people are like, it's just people are, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2887.52s)]
*  I'm thoroughly mystified by why they would do it. Is there any, can you fathom any reason in polling [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2893.2s)]
*  you've seen about why you wouldn't, is there a fear about backlash with white voters or whatever [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2898.32s)]
*  it is that would keep you from talking about a broader, like protecting the dreamers, keeping [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2903.76s)]
*  families together, like going back to essentially the Obama era message on immigration reform? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2908.0800000000004s)]
*  Man, I don't know. I'll be honest. I think it's straight up fear. I do think there were some polls [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2914.32s)]
*  that showed there was a high support for quote unquote mass deportation, but man, just dig one [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2920.7200000000003s)]
*  step deeper. And you can look at the fact that when you asked me, it's mass deportation in this [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2926.64s)]
*  moment, people literally assume you mean get the border under control, like people who arrived [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2930.48s)]
*  yesterday. And there is a difference in how Latinos and Americans more broadly perceive someone who [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2936.16s)]
*  just arrived versus someone who has been in this community a very long time. And so I think they're [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2942.56s)]
*  saying the polling- And the kids, right? And the kids, the dreamers, I mean, you know, in the [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2947.68s)]
*  NBC Telemundo poll, this is Latinos, but this holds up when you look at Americans more broadly. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2951.36s)]
*  If you ask, do you think we should deport all immigrants, there's actually 39% of Latinos in [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2957.44s)]
*  that poll support a expanded deportation program. When you ask, should we protect and put spouses [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2961.76s)]
*  of American citizens on a pathway to citizenship, only 8% oppose. When you ask, should we put [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2969.76s)]
*  dreamers on a pathway to citizenship, only 13 oppose. So, you know, again, so much of winning [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2975.68s)]
*  is about picking the right fights as Dan, you yourself say so well. You cannot be reactionary. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2982.7999999999997s)]
*  You have to pick the fights that benefit you and you can't allow the other side to reframe it, [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2987.9199999999996s)]
*  whether that's on the economy. We can't debate the economy more broadly. Democrats have to be [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2991.6s)]
*  fighting about prescription drug prices. They have to be fighting about specifics of the economy. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=2996.24s)]
*  And similarly on immigration, you can't debate the border as this impossible problem, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3002.0s)]
*  but specifics, what would you do about this particular family? What would you do about [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3007.36s)]
*  this specific kid? Because that's where they have advantages. Before I let you go, I do have to ask [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3011.36s)]
*  you about your native state of Florida and the New York Times on a poll this week. Sorry, sorry, [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3016.16s)]
*  I got to do it. We got to get we got to we have to make some progress in Florida. We can't just [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3022.08s)]
*  write the thing off. New York Times had a poll out this week that had Trump up 13 in [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3026.0s)]
*  Florida. And that's obviously a big outlier from what the averages have been. The argument that [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3031.84s)]
*  the New York Times makes for some pretty esoteric reasons I won't get into here, but is that there [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3038.1600000000003s)]
*  has been a dramatic shift in the state since 2020. You can see evidence of that in the 2022 results. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3042.32s)]
*  Where do you see Florida right now? So sorry, sorry. No, no, listen, here's here's here's [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3048.32s)]
*  the challenge. Florida didn't really stop being a purple state. The national decision by Democrats [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3056.56s)]
*  to walk away from Florida, starting in 2020, right? In 2020, actually, Florida was outsourced to [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3064.48s)]
*  Michael Bloomberg. The Biden campaign didn't itself run a campaign in Florida at the scale [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3069.84s)]
*  that a presidential normally would. In 2022, there was no national investment in Florida. It was gone, [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3076.0s)]
*  absolutely. And then obviously, you're seeing something similar in 2024. That's a money [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3080.0s)]
*  calculation. That's just Florida's expensive. Expensive for the fact that it is so tricky, [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3084.16s)]
*  and oftentimes, the rug gets slipped out from under Democrats feet in a state like Florida, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3089.68s)]
*  right? But it's still purple. The dynamics of it are still so. But if you don't show up and you [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3094.16s)]
*  don't play in it, of course, you're going to get a result that is worse than average. So I think [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3100.16s)]
*  in everything I have seen, there was a little bit of reversion to what we were seeing in 2020. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3111.04s)]
*  I think it is weird. I understand the Nate Cohn New York Times esoteric argument about waiting [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3118.32s)]
*  on pass vote. We don't have to get into that here. But Nate Cohn has very good reasons that he [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3125.52s)]
*  doesn't wait to pass vote. And yet, what we kind of want to understand is difference from 2020 and [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3131.52s)]
*  how much defection there has been in addition to changes in the composition of electorate. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3136.56s)]
*  We could look at the composition of the electorate with things like the voter file [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3140.48s)]
*  and understand how much has changed. But you also want to understand have people who voted a certain [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3143.6s)]
*  way in 2020 changed their mind. And that's really only happening a little bit on the margins. So you [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3147.2799999999997s)]
*  would expect a result that was not 2020, but closer to it. And so Trump winning by 10 seems a little [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3152.7999999999997s)]
*  bit outside of what my expectation would be. I mean, I've seen some internal polling in the last [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3160.08s)]
*  few days that was Trump up four. That seems a little bit more in line. That said, almost any [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3164.16s)]
*  result is possible in Florida given the stew of elements that have conspired to the benefit of [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3170.3999999999996s)]
*  Republicans. If anything, a lot of the people who used to move to Arizona and retire in Arizona [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3180.24s)]
*  now seem to be retiring in Florida. So maybe it's all to the benefit of the wider Sun Belt strategy [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3185.12s)]
*  that Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis have kind of sucked up mega conservatives into this one [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3191.52s)]
*  state that Democrats no longer really try to play in. That's the thing I think a lot of [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3196.88s)]
*  people don't think about when it comes to Florida. We talk about how in-migration into [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3202.32s)]
*  Georgia and North Carolina helps us because you have all these younger people who are moving to [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3206.2400000000002s)]
*  Raleigh-Durham or Atlanta. But what we don't count in Florida is you have all these older, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3210.0s)]
*  more likely Republicans from New York and New Jersey who are constantly moving into Florida. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3214.6400000000003s)]
*  And then you do have, it's fair to say, some shifts within the Latino, some pretty dramatic [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3218.48s)]
*  shifts within the Latino vote, especially since 2012, right? Exactly. Newer Hispanic voters, [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3222.08s)]
*  like the ones who have become eligible to vote who are not just Cuban but Venezuelan or Colombian, [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3227.04s)]
*  they're more conservative than previous cohorts. They kind of came into the electorate during the [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3232.16s)]
*  Trump era, kind of caught the Trump fever. So there's a confluence of events. Although I will [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3235.6s)]
*  say, I think decisions made by Ron DeSantis within the state of Florida make much more sense when you [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3240.16s)]
*  understand them as being a shaping of the electorate, not of winning over anybody's minds, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3245.12s)]
*  but about shaping who decides to go to school in Florida, who decides to retire in Florida, [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3250.08s)]
*  who decides to move away from Florida. Many of the decisions they make are really about sending [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3255.2s)]
*  signals that are like setting up the pro-MAGA flag and saying all MAGA people welcome, liberals not. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3261.12s)]
*  And I think that does obviously have an effect on the margins. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3268.3199999999997s)]
*  Just in closing here, as we go through the final three weeks of this campaign, [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3271.2s)]
*  what are you going to be watching for specifically when it comes to the Latino vote? [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3274.4s)]
*  That will hopefully give you some sense of what's actually going to happen on election night. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3277.44s)]
*  There's going to be a lot of attention on how much slippage there was from 2020. I already [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3283.84s)]
*  referred to it a little bit at the top, that if Biden was at 62, right now Harris is struggling [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3286.96s)]
*  to get past 60. I want to urge people not to fall into hysteria. We've got to... [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3293.12s)]
*  You know, polling is... What I do is polling. I'm not a pollster, but I poll a lot. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3300.96s)]
*  Polling is inadequate for this moment. Polling can tell us that we're in a 50-50 environment, [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3307.76s)]
*  but it can't tell us which side of the 50-50 line Harris is going to fall on. It's just not equipped [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3313.76s)]
*  for that. That's not literally what it's not designed to do. It's a little bit like a find [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3320.56s)]
*  my phone feature. It can tell you that your phone is on your block or in your house, [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3323.44s)]
*  but it can't tell you whether it's under the couch or it's in your bedroom. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3328.4s)]
*  Polling similarly is going to tell us at a certain point, yeah, there's a close election, [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3332.32s)]
*  but that isn't going to tell us at the end. So the polling is not what we need to look at, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3335.44s)]
*  right? The polling is a good gut check on our own assumptions. It does tell us some real things [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3339.6800000000003s)]
*  about movement and what people care about that maybe our operatives wouldn't have thought going [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3346.56s)]
*  in. But at the end of the day, look, assume this is 59-39 among Latino voters and there's a fight [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3352.72s)]
*  for the last inches. I don't expect any vast movement in polling. If there were, I think that [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3360.9599999999996s)]
*  would be something worth looking at. I also would urge, disregarding early vote numbers, [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3368.08s)]
*  we have been burned by that so many times. Please don't over fixate on that. But look, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3374.72s)]
*  at the end of the day, what I think this is going to come down to, as I said, is what is the question [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3385.2799999999997s)]
*  on voters' minds as they're going into making that decision about whether to vote and who to vote for? [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3390.7999999999997s)]
*  And so I try to step back and look at the ad traffic, look at what I'm seeing in the earned [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3398.64s)]
*  media and say, what is the question voters are taking from this? What are we fighting about in [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3403.44s)]
*  the last few weeks? And Democrats and allies need to be picking the right fights. That's what these [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3409.2000000000003s)]
*  last few weeks is about. Are the things that we're debating about the kinds of things that are going [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3417.04s)]
*  to help Harris win this election if it's what's on voters' minds and not allow Trump to do what he [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3422.88s)]
*  always does, which is distract us with side conversations that actually, at the end of the [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3428.4s)]
*  day, don't help move the electorate, that don't provide new information. Because what persuades [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3432.96s)]
*  voters to vote and to vote for your side is new information. Beating them overhead with what they [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3437.92s)]
*  already know is not it. So what is the new information that comes out in these last few weeks? [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3444.48s)]
*  And how does that frame the choice before voters in the end run? Well, that seems like a great place [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3448.8s)]
*  to end it. Carlos, thank you so much and good luck over this final stretch here. Hope you stay [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3455.12s)]
*  sane. That'll wrap today's episode. Thank you to David Pluff and Carlos Odeo. I'll be backing your [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzpT138vOIU&t=3458.88s)]
