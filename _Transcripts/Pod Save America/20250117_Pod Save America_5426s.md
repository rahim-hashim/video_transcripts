Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Ceasefire Deal Reached in Israel and Gaza, Biden and Trump Both Claim Credit
**Pod Save America:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg)
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Jon Favreau. I'm Dan Pfeiffer. Dan Pfeiffer right here in Los Angeles [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=0.0s)]
*  This is where everyone wants to be this time of year, right? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  That is true. Welcome to our beautiful city. On today's show we're going to talk about the Gaza ceasefire deal [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=8.4s)]
*  That Biden and Trump are both taking credit for and whether it will actually hold [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=14.16s)]
*  We'll get into the senate confirmation hearings for Trump's impeccably qualified cabinet picks, especially Pete Hegseth and Pam Bondi [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=18.48s)]
*  There's also a last-minute scramble to save TikTok before the ban goes into effect this weekend [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=25.44s)]
*  And later I talked to Ben Wickler about his candidacy for DNC chair [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=30.08s)]
*  But first this is officially our last show of the Biden administration [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  And on Wednesday night the president delivered his farewell address from the oval office [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=39.92s)]
*  This speech is a tradition for outgoing presidents [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=43.84s)]
*  Uh, and so is including some kind of warning to the country. Uh, Biden certainly did that in his address. Uh, let's listen today [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=46.64s)]
*  An oligarchy is taking shape in america of extreme wealth power and influence [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  And we've seen it before [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=59.04s)]
*  more than a century ago [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=60.96s)]
*  But the american people stood up to the robber barons back then [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=63.52s)]
*  And busted the trusts [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=67.76s)]
*  I'm equally concerned about the potential rise [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=69.68s)]
*  Of a tech industrial complex [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=73.04s)]
*  That could pose real dangers for our country as well [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=75.28s)]
*  Americans are being buried [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=79.74000000000001s)]
*  Under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=81.92s)]
*  Enabling the abuse of power [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=85.76s)]
*  The free press is crumbling editors are disappearing social media is giving up on fact checking [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=88.0s)]
*  The truth is smothered by lies [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=96.16000000000001s)]
*  Toll for power and for profit joe biden come on offline [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=99.04s)]
*  Uh, I was pleasantly surprised that biden chose to focus on economic inequality wealth concentration [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=103.92s)]
*  Took one last parting shot at our new tech oligarchs [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=111.68s)]
*  What'd you think about that choice? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=115.28s)]
*  I thought I loved it. I had two thoughts first was great. The second was what took you so long, right? Just it is [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=117.04s)]
*  I think if biden had talked like this more i'm not saying it would have changed the political commons race [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=125.04s)]
*  But this has been a problem for a very long time and that sort of populist [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=129.6s)]
*  Rhetoric was a big part of his campaign when he ran and then became largely absent in his presidency [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=134.94s)]
*  I mean these speeches and I this morning because [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=140.72s)]
*  I hate myself. I watched the carter speech the george hw speech the trump speech the george w bush speech the othana speech [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=144.64s)]
*  All on you really do hate yourself. I did on on 2x speed. Um, and they're all [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=152.0s)]
*  Incredibly most of them are incredibly boring the speeches and most of they follow a very [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=158.46s)]
*  specific pattern of thanking their [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=163.28s)]
*  The american people for giving the privilege to be president thanking their staff members even trump. Thank mike pence in his video [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=166.56s)]
*  only [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=174.0s)]
*  Did trump do trump did he skip a farewell here at least a video? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=175.84s)]
*  Oh, right, right, but it looks when you watch it on youtube looks just like the other ones because he's standing [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=179.04s)]
*  In the east wing doing it [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=184.32s)]
*  um [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=186.56s)]
*  And then they want then they talk about the terrible situation they inherited [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=187.6s)]
*  They tout their accomplishments and then they end by saying this is where trump did not do this [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=191.52s)]
*  That they are going to return to the only job greater than president citizen citizen [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=195.76s)]
*  um, and so biden doing something like [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=199.44s)]
*  Eisenhower did in his speech and which I did not watch and obama did it his to do something a little more interesting that it actually [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=202.70000000000002s)]
*  Acknowledges what's happening in the country. I mean the george w bush speech is [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=209.52s)]
*  Just like on another planet like you would never know that the economy was an absolute freefall. He spent like 22 words on the economy [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  um, I mean that was talking about people who left office with a poor approval rating 31% [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=220.72s)]
*  Yeah, that's like middle of financial crisis after a bailout plus after uh, years of the iraq war [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=225.52s)]
*  And katrina and everything else, but I think it was important that biden acknowledged something that's happening in the country and did deliver [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=231.6s)]
*  A warning that is going to feel very [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=238.4s)]
*  Precious when three days after you're listening this podcast [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=241.18s)]
*  Donald trump is putting his hand on the bible to take the oath of office surrounded by jeff bezos mark zuckerberg the head of tiktok [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=244.56s)]
*  Uh a the billionaire class forgot elon and of course literally the three elon will be holding the bible the three [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=251.6s)]
*  Richest men in the world will be on the dais at the inauguration [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=259.76s)]
*  Like sitting there with members of congress and the cabinet and the other presidents just the three richest people in the fucking world [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=264.8s)]
*  And I think there is something for democrats here in a message going forward. I would not use the term oligarch [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=271.76s)]
*  I would not talk about busting the trusts or the robber barons. Did you see brian stelter had tweeted that uh, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=276.32s)]
*  One of the top search terms after biden's speech was what is an oligarch? Yeah [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=283.92s)]
*  Exactly, I did not see that which is like like on a positive note people were tuning in [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=288.23999999999995s)]
*  Less positive didn't know what oligarch if they have to if people have to google the primary part of your message [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=294.79999999999995s)]
*  It's probably I mean, it's fine for biden is speaking to history here. He's not trying to persuade voters per se in this moment [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=301.03999999999996s)]
*  So that's a fine choice for him to use but like donald trump is putting more than a dozen [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=306.4s)]
*  billionaires in his government in his cabinet on the doge commission in his white house and [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=311.9s)]
*  I think the idea that republican donald trump republicans have a government of buy in for [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=317.59999999999997s)]
*  The ultra wealthy in this country is a message that democrats should latch onto and biden helps at the stage for that [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=322.23999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I think I think that the I mean it's a farewell address [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=327.52s)]
*  So you can only do so much in a farewell address when you have a bunch of other territory to cover [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=330.4s)]
*  but um, I do think that there is a [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=334.4s)]
*  There's a roadmap there for democrats [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=337.2s)]
*  Um, and you know and biden, you know was even able to say we're not trying to like punish [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=339.52s)]
*  Rich people we're trying to make sure that they pay their fair share and that they don't like control everything [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=344.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I mean that seems like a it seems like a [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=350.48s)]
*  Message that people would be receptive to what do you think about the speech overall? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=353.68s)]
*  I thought it was it was good [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=357.12s)]
*  Like it was in the vein of the other speeches that I was that I that I watched this morning it followed that pattern [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=358.24s)]
*  You know, I think on one level it's like you want [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=364.72s)]
*  Biden to wrestle with what has come the consequences some of the decisions he made the just these [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=368.32s)]
*  The scary prospect that all americans are facing by what's about to come with donald trump [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=374.08s)]
*  That I think is sort of an impossible ask [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=378.24s)]
*  In that well in that speech, right obama did something very different than everyone else. He gave a much longer speech [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=381.52s)]
*  He went to chicago did in the crowd. He viewed his [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=387.2s)]
*  Message he did all the other things. He was glad to be citizen. He touted his accomplishments [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=390.96000000000004s)]
*  He talked about what he inherited but also tried to give people hope that if you do the work of politics you could bounce back [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=394.24s)]
*  From this [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=400.08s)]
*  That was not really the cards for biden and where there wasn't for anyone else who's ever done this [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=401.28000000000003s)]
*  Um, I think it's for for biden. It was a it was a good it was a good speech, right? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=404.88s)]
*  You know we can critique some of the more [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=409.84000000000003s)]
*  Flowery language. Yeah, that may not have landed but once again [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=412.8s)]
*  your [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=416.16s)]
*  People are going to read this in the future right as opposed to watch it in the moment [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=417.2s)]
*  someday soon [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=421.52s)]
*  I will have [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=423.04s)]
*  some constructive criticism [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=424.32s)]
*  for [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=426.32s)]
*  all democratic politicians and staffers [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=427.20000000000005s)]
*  About speech writing and speech giving in what I mean one [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=430.88s)]
*  You haven't been holding back on that and it's that you do you have a are you announcing a book like what are you talking? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=435.68s)]
*  I'm i'm it just watching biden's speech again. And what i'm the reason i'm saying this is this is not a [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=440.16s)]
*  Specific critique of biden, but it's something that has been bothering me [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=446.0s)]
*  For the the last several years and thinking about how we are now in a pretty awful situation [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=450.32s)]
*  The democratic party and there's a lot that the democratic party has to fix and I do not think if everyone in the democratic party [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=456.16s)]
*  started suddenly giving great speeches that all our problems would be solved at all, but [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=461.2s)]
*  As you know because you have written books about this the way we communicate with each other [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=466.24s)]
*  Has changed dramatically the way we consume what politicians say has changed dramatically over the last decade even [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=470.96000000000004s)]
*  And the way that politicians speak has not changed [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=479.68s)]
*  Just you talking about how? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=483.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, well that you know typical speeches farewell addresses have followed this pattern. It's like you're right [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=485.2s)]
*  They have but donald trump is supposed to be president for the second time the country made its worst person president twice now [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=490.64s)]
*  and so maybe [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=498.16s)]
*  Maybe it's time for some out of the box thinking [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=500.16s)]
*  on on the way that we communicate and maybe they like stayed sort of [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=502.88s)]
*  His sweep of history [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=508.88000000000005s)]
*  Speaking like we're trying to get into the history books and not like we're trying to communicate with people maybe that style of speaking [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=512.4s)]
*  Is uh something that we should get rid of or something we should maybe think twice about and again again [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=519.28s)]
*  This is not just a joe biden thing. This is [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=523.44s)]
*  an [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=526.32s)]
*  most democratic politicians thing and I think if you cannot communicate [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=527.12s)]
*  Effectively and capture people's attention. We are in a we are in a war for attention [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=532.78s)]
*  for people's attention [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=538.16s)]
*  against [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=539.76s)]
*  figures like donald trump and elon musk who are [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=540.8s)]
*  so shameless that they will basically say or do anything to [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=544.64s)]
*  Get people's attention to get people to notice them. So that's what we're competing against and we're competing against them by [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=550.16s)]
*  Having with a bunch of democratic politicians who still speak like their press releases [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=557.28s)]
*  Well, I mean, yes, they're I would I would actually argue that we should almost entirely stop giving speeches [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=561.1999999999999s)]
*  But I think we i'm having dead serious about that. Well, but I think that [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=568.16s)]
*  Yes [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=572.16s)]
*  In the way that you're defining speeches [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=573.04s)]
*  I think that we need to like democratic politicians need to over communicate like need to communicate more. I think that [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=575.36s)]
*  For good or for ill and I think it's probably for ill [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=581.12s)]
*  Americans got used to during the first trump term their president being in their face all the time [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=584.7199999999999s)]
*  A lot of people didn't like donald trump being in their face, but enough did that. I think they felt like that in the obama [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=589.12s)]
*  Era too that what that obama was around he was omnipresent in your life. He was in your culture in your media [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=594.24s)]
*  but even then [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=600.88s)]
*  You remember times when the the public and the pundits were like we haven't heard from barack obama yet [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=602.64s)]
*  Don't get me fucking started [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=608.56s)]
*  As the guy who had to yeah, right shit. Yeah, me neither [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=610.48s)]
*  But even then and and barack obama was out there a lot and it still wasn't enough, you know, but the idea that we [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=613.52s)]
*  We're just going to keep doing the same thing speaking the same way using the same cliches [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=620.5600000000001s)]
*  Using the same poll tested lines using the same phrase like we know that a message of sort of a harder edged [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=624.96s)]
*  Populism talking about the tech oligarchy like it's a good message [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=632.38s)]
*  but the way it comes out and I actually think biden I think that the writing around the [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=636.5600000000001s)]
*  Aside from the use of the word oligarch the writing around that was was strong [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=641.44s)]
*  Yeah fair bottom up middle out one more time. I'm just going to like throw my phone out the window [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=644.8000000000001s)]
*  um [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=649.12s)]
*  Because I don't think anyone knows what that means [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=650.0799999999999s)]
*  But you're sick of writing it so many times during the obama reelection campaign [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=651.5999999999999s)]
*  I never I did not write that during the middle out versus top down you wrote that a lot. Yeah, not bottom up [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=655.28s)]
*  Middle out first of all middle. Okay, make sense bottom up make sense top down make sense [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=661.92s)]
*  Neither of them are very creative, but they at least make sense middle out doesn't make any sense. Well, you know, it got you [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=666.9599999999999s)]
*  Uh 312 electoral votes or whatever it was [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=672.9599999999999s)]
*  No, we're gonna go back and look at the speeches afterwards anyway [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=675.84s)]
*  anyway [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=679.2s)]
*  But that brings up a good point because I and i'm not saying this is like oh barack obama [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=680.64s)]
*  If barack obama came back today and gave all the same speeches that he gave when he was president when he was running for office [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=684.96s)]
*  I don't think that would fit the moment either [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=689.9200000000001s)]
*  Like we just have to update the way we communicate and we have to do it in a more organic way authentic way [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=692.32s)]
*  Conversational it's just the style the style of political speaking and honestly [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=699.4200000000001s)]
*  For a lot of republicans not named donald trump. They have the same problem, you know [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=704.8000000000001s)]
*  It's not just a democratic party problem, but it's just you're not reaching people this way [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=708.88s)]
*  I was judging this in the context of for sure [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=712.24s)]
*  Joe biden, right who is not going to is it has proven in course of presence [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=715.6s)]
*  He's not be the person to radically change how democrats communicate. Yes, um, and I was judging it. I also think like this [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=719.6800000000001s)]
*  It this speech is something for the president to do on their way out [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=726.32s)]
*  It is every president has done it in at least in modern era [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=730.64s)]
*  It is valedictory. It's a chance to [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=735.12s)]
*  Put your you have usually if you're on your way out in most cases, there are some exceptions [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=737.68s)]
*  reagan [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=743.28s)]
*  Obama sort of really just reagan right where you are leaving ascendant. You have served two terms and you're being succeeded by someone in your own party [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=744.88s)]
*  Most times you are dealing your you've been served a shit sandwich. Yeah, you lost you're leaving incredibly unpopular [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=752.96s)]
*  Your successor lost and it's just your chance to just go out and say something [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=759.54s)]
*  Without anyone yelling at you while you do it. Yeah, and then biden did that and I thought it under judged under that [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=764.18s)]
*  He did a good job. Like he look my expectation was that he was going to [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=769.46s)]
*  Go do his like it was i'm the guy who did x y and z and did all this accomplishments and that's it [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=774.26s)]
*  And the fact that he took the time to do a warning to the country and talk about that [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=778.9s)]
*  I think that was that surpassed my expectations. So again, this was not a critique of [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=783.46s)]
*  Joe biden specifically it's a critique of democratic speech giving which is a problem that goes beyond joe biden now that he's off the scene [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=788.1800000000001s)]
*  I will once again just take my take that I think we should get rid of 99 speeches. Yeah, I mean i'm i'm good [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=794.98s)]
*  uh [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=800.1s)]
*  So since this is our last time talking about joe biden for a while [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=801.14s)]
*  How are you thinking about his legacy and and how his presidency will be remembered? Yeah [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=804.02s)]
*  I mean as i've talked about in the show before [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=808.58s)]
*  I'm from delaware other than the four years of trump's first administration joe biden has been [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=811.22s)]
*  My senator vice president president my entire life [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=816.5s)]
*  Like I don't know a time when joe biden wasn't representing me in office. I you and I we worked with him [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=819.7s)]
*  He is incredibly decent to me [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=826.74s)]
*  Personally very supportive of my career. He was always so proud. There was another delawareian in those meetings in the white house always [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=829.86s)]
*  And i'm always be grateful to him for that [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=835.78s)]
*  His legacy is obviously very very complicated [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=838.82s)]
*  He did a lot of really good things and most important on that list is [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=841.46s)]
*  He came out of retirement in 2020 to run and defeat donald trump [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=845.94s)]
*  And i'm not sure there's another person who was running who would have accomplished that for us [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=849.7s)]
*  and [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=854.1800000000001s)]
*  But because that was the center and he said that's why he came out [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=855.22s)]
*  It's because of charlottesville and the healing soul of the nation and all of that [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=858.4200000000001s)]
*  And then when he got in he did a lot of really really good important things [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=862.34s)]
*  absolutely [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=866.32s)]
*  it's not as [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=867.46s)]
*  Historic as the biden talking points would tell you and they're you know his where his allies compare him to fdr and lbj [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=868.96s)]
*  That is not the case a lot of those things are also at risk [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=875.6800000000001s)]
*  Of trump and that's why the the legacy is unwritten because we don't [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=879.44s)]
*  You know will the climate suspending that is so important that if we actually that we may look back decades from now incredibly grateful to biden [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=883.2s)]
*  For doing it will that survive? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=889.76s)]
*  Will the infrastructures will those bridges actually be built? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=891.36s)]
*  You know, we don't know that and that was that's true for every president when they leave [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=893.76s)]
*  That was true for obama would the affordable care act survive [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=896.56s)]
*  But the ultimate [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=902.16s)]
*  thing here is is that [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=904.48s)]
*  His legacy is clouded because he was unwilling to listen to the american people who were telling him in the loudest voice possible [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=907.28s)]
*  Not to run for reelection [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=913.92s)]
*  And he stuck it out and insisted that he was right and everyone else was wrong [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=915.68s)]
*  To the point where he ended up having to drop out of the race with a hundred some days to go making it [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=921.1199999999999s)]
*  Almost impossible for a democrat to win this election now and the democratic party is now [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=926.8s)]
*  in [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=933.68s)]
*  It's the worst political spot. It's been in in decades [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=934.88s)]
*  donald trump who joe biden [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=937.92s)]
*  Came out of retirement to kick out of office is now back stronger more popular than ever before [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=940.64s)]
*  And it's all of the that is not joe biden's fault [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=945.6800000000001s)]
*  It's not his fault that we have inflation. He actually think he handled inflation as well as anyone could in the situation [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=948.72s)]
*  It's not his fault that he was he was bad luck to be president during the a great global anti-incumbent wave [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=954.08s)]
*  But on the one thing he could control which was whether he should run for reelection [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=959.76s)]
*  He made the wrong decision and the country reaped the consequences of that. Yeah, I mean [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=962.88s)]
*  I think he is a tragic figure [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=968.08s)]
*  in that [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=970.8000000000001s)]
*  this is a man who [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=971.76s)]
*  Persevered as a public servant through unimaginable loss [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=973.5799999999999s)]
*  until he [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=978.16s)]
*  Finally achieves his lifelong dream of becoming president at almost 80 years old [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=979.68s)]
*  An age where he was too old to do the part of the job that has become [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=987.12s)]
*  Maybe one of the most important parts of the job, which is communicating effectively with the american people and he was always a [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=992.72s)]
*  mediocre communicator [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1000.4s)]
*  You know throughout most of his life and then when by the time he got to be president he his age [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1002.32s)]
*  made it even worse and [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1008.0s)]
*  It's difficult because [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1011.12s)]
*  You know back to all of our conversations about like how kamala could have separated herself from biden during the campaign [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1013.36s)]
*  aside from [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1019.7600000000001s)]
*  gaza, which we're about to talk about [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1021.12s)]
*  I don't have [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1024.0s)]
*  a lot of critiques of biden's [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1025.68s)]
*  like legislative or policy decisions [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1028.48s)]
*  During his presidency. In fact, he did a just a lot of things that I very much support [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1031.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm i'm very grateful to him for doing that [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1037.0400000000002s)]
*  but [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1039.8400000000001s)]
*  to my point about speeches and stuff I I did, you know, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1040.88s)]

*  a performance and is it about it's about communicating and it's about telling people a story and it's about breaking through the noise [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1049.1200000000001s)]
*  and it's about commanding people's attention and [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1056.5600000000002s)]
*  Joe biden because of his long experience in washington was very good at building coalitions and knowing how congress works and [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1059.76s)]
*  And that showed in his presidency [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1067.9199999999998s)]
*  but [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1070.56s)]
*  The storytelling part of the job and the communication part of the job [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1071.4399999999998s)]
*  It was never his strongest suit and by the time he got there [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1075.84s)]
*  He was you know, he was slowed down by age [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1079.84s)]
*  and then [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1084.08s)]
*  Like you said couldn't see that it was time for him to step aside [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1085.28s)]
*  You know, so that's and it's like he is the guy who saved the country from donald trump [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1089.28s)]
*  And the same guy who made it possible for trump to return [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1093.84s)]
*  And that is just I mean that talk about tragic figure right there, you know [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1096.8s)]
*  Like he's he's got that achievement and then he has to live with the and we all have to live with the other part [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1100.56s)]
*  So it's tough. But like you said, there are you know, largest infrastructure bills since eisenhower. It's trillion dollars in spending [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1105.28s)]
*  You know, unfortunately all the projects [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1112.0s)]
*  A lot of the projects haven't been uh completed yet, but hopefully years from now. We'll look back at [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1114.72s)]
*  Roads highways bridges everything else and so that was like what eisenhower did biden did that too same thing with climate if it's not overturned [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1120.0s)]
*  35 insulin and lower prescription drugs for seniors ended the war in afghanistan even though it was a chaotic withdrawal [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1127.9s)]
*  Um, so got us out of the pandemic got us out of the pandemic got us out better [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1135.2s)]
*  Better than any other country in the world. Well, and that's the other tragedy there, too [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1139.52s)]
*  Is that he he led us out of the pandemic, but he wasn't it helped he wasn't able to help us overcome [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1142.4s)]
*  all of the [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1149.1200000000001s)]
*  economic political cultural even psychological consequences that came from the pandemic inflation crime migration [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1150.4s)]
*  Growing distrust of institutions all of those problems that were there before the pandemic but that the pandemic accelerated [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1158.24s)]
*  And I don't think any I don't know if any president in his position, uh could have helped us overcome that but [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1165.8400000000001s)]
*  we are very much dealing with the lingering effects of the pandemic and [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1171.76s)]
*  Um, and that was an unfortunate place for him to be in and again not his fault [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1176.3999999999999s)]
*  But I mean presidents usually you lose reelection for reasons that have little to do with [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1180.32s)]
*  How they communicate how they campaign or even really how they govern. It's the environment around them. It's what yep [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1185.68s)]
*  It's what felled carter. It was why george hw bush lost [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1190.32s)]
*  And I think that's largely true for biden except for the one thing he could control [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1195.04s)]
*  Which was whether he ran for reelection or not and he made he was he made the wrong a tragically wrong decision there. Yeah [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1199.1200000000001s)]
*  But uh, it was a like I said, it was it was a good speech last night [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1205.92s)]
*  and um, there's a lot of good things he did for the country that I hope [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1209.68s)]

*  Okay [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1466.72s)]
*  So biden opened his farewell address by talking about the ceasefire deal that was reached this week between israel and hamas [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1467.2s)]
*  That would lead to the release of 33 hostages in the first phase [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1472.48s)]
*  Hundreds of palestinian prisoners and allow for more humanitarian relief in gaza 15 months after the war began [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1476.08s)]
*  Israel's cabinet will vote to ratify the deal the first phase of which is set to start on sunday though [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1482.22s)]
*  There were reportedly some last minute hiccups on thursday [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1487.04s)]
*  And since you may be wondering why are john and dan talking about foreign policy fear not our pal tommy is here to set us straight [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1490.4s)]
*  Hey guys, hey tommy good to be here on thursday. Yeah, welcome to the thursday pod danny [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1497.04s)]
*  You want to riff on the friday pod want to riff on the war and gaza? I have a series of follow-ups for you [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1500.64s)]
*  So let's hear what you got. That's fun tommy aside from what I just said [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1505.2s)]
*  What else should we know about the deal and how it came together? [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1508.5600000000002s)]
*  Well, yeah [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1511.5200000000002s)]
*  I think you make an important point at the top which is that the israeli government has not voted on the deal yet and [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1512.0s)]
*  And a far-right member of the netanyahu coalition just announced he might remove himself from the government [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1515.92s)]
*  So things are pretty precarious tony blinkin said that should start being implemented on sunday [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1521.44s)]
*  That that would be good news, but let's hope it's right [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1526.24s)]
*  But I think there's just a lot of uncertainty in this deal currently and a lot of it could fall apart before we get [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1528.96s)]
*  To the end of phase three like you outlined phase one, which is six weeks [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1534.88s)]
*  It is the part that is the most fleshed out with this gradual release of prisoners of hostages [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1539.92s)]
*  I should say and then the israeli should could release over 1 000 palestinian prisoners the israeli troops [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1545.1200000000001s)]
*  Pull back from population centers palestinians get to go home and age gets surged into the strip [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1552.64s)]
*  But phases two and three have not been finalized yet. Um, those start getting negotiated. I think on the 16th day of phase one [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1557.2s)]
*  So phase two is likely to include, uh the return of all [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1565.2s)]
*  Uh hostages by hamas in exchange for more prisoners than the full withdrawal of israeli troops [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1569.34s)]
*  And then the third phase is reconstruction [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1575.1200000000001s)]
*  But you know joe biden views this as a deal that will permanently end the war [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1577.28s)]
*  I don't know that netanyahu thinks of it in the same way throughout this negotiation [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1582.48s)]
*  He has tried to reserve the right to restart fighting at the time of his choosing [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1587.6s)]
*  Um, and right wing lawmakers that are part of his government coalition want that to happen [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1592.8s)]
*  So a lot is up in the air right now [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1598.24s)]
*  You said that a minister has said that he might remove himself from the coalition [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1600.8s)]
*  Does that? [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1605.92s)]
*  Uh, does that screw with the deal? Like how do they need everyone? How does that work? [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1607.1200000000001s)]
*  I think netanyahu should have the votes to get it through a security cabinet and the full cabinet [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1611.68s)]
*  But um, I just don't know right now. It's sort of in flux. Is that who has to approve it? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1616.16s)]
*  It's the cabinet. Yeah, there's two different votes. I think there's a security cabinet vote and then a full sort of government cabinet vote [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1619.84s)]
*  so [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1625.92s)]
*  You mentioned biden he's taking credit for the deal [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1626.8s)]
*  Trump is also taking credit for the deal. I've read reporting that suggests both deserve some credit [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1629.76s)]
*  Yeah, uh, what do you think so in a lot of the reporting on the deal? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1634.48s)]
*  You'll see these background quotes from israeli or arab diplomat saying this deal only got over the finish line because of trump now [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1637.2s)]
*  Obviously that is a very self-serving quote if you're like a netanyahu official or a you know [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1644.0800000000002s)]
*  Someone sitting in cutter or egypt because you want to curry favor with the incoming administration not the outgoing [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1649.2s)]
*  But I do think trump deserves some credit here. Um [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1654.8s)]
*  A lot of this basic framework of this deal the three phases the sequencing etc. That was on the table eight months ago [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1658.8s)]
*  And this time in these last couple days, it seems like trump through his you know, steve wickoff [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1664.6399999999999s)]
*  His new emissary was able to apply or willing to apply pressure on netanyahu in ways that biden was not [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1670.24s)]
*  Um, and I also think that if trump had said bb stick it to biden don't give him a deal [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1677.36s)]
*  Let's not do this until i'm officially president. That's what had happened [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1682.6399999999999s)]
*  so [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1686.1599999999999s)]
*  That part I think trump really does deserve some credit for that said [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1687.04s)]
*  Biden's team negotiated this whole plan [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1691.12s)]
*  And that's not a small thing because it's the phasing and the sequencing for how the hostages get released and and [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1694.56s)]
*  Where israeli troops withdraw from and when like it's complicated stuff and getting hamas and netanyahu on the same page on anything [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1700.08s)]
*  It's going to be complicated. So [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1706.08s)]
*  Biden's team they did the diplomatic spade work. Um, I think he also deserves credit for bringing donald trump into the talks [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1707.6s)]
*  You know like biden could have said i'm going to try to like go it alone these last few weeks [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1714.1599999999999s)]
*  I want 100 credit for this [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1718.6399999999999s)]
*  Um, but he didn't do that he he I think [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1720.64s)]
*  Reportedly in that oval office meeting with trump said to him. Let's do this together [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1723.42s)]
*  Let's try to get this done and that along with pressure from trump. Um, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1727.5200000000002s)]
*  Has seems to have made the difference [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1731.92s)]
*  It's also just worth pointing out that like when biden introduced this deal in may of last year to now a lot has changed [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1733.6000000000001s)]
*  Like hamas is decimated hesbullah is decapitated [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1740.0800000000002s)]
*  Iran is weakened and then on top of trump putting pressure on the israelis to do this deal [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1743.44s)]
*  There's also just the reality that netanyahu can say to the far right. Hey, I know you hate this ceasefire [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1749.28s)]
*  But donald trump's going to give us anything we want going forward [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1755.04s)]
*  I was going to ask from netanyahu's perspective like why would he be more persuaded by trump than biden? [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1757.68s)]
*  I mean, I just think like he knows he has four years of dealing with this guy and trump's out there tweeting [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1764.48s)]
*  There will be hell to pay. Um [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1769.04s)]
*  apparently by both sides [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1771.76s)]
*  uh, and so [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1773.44s)]
*  He knows that like I I think he knows he was not in the best graces with trump when he [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1775.2s)]
*  Did the committed the mortal sin of congratulating joe biden for winning the election in 2020? [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1781.52s)]
*  Yeah, it took a while to crawl back from that [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1785.6000000000001s)]
*  um being in the doghouse [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1788.32s)]
*  and so [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1790.48s)]
*  I think netanyahu was like look [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1792.24s)]
*  He can say to his co to his right wing members of his coalition. Look, we'll give him this one [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1794.32s)]
*  If I decide to restart the war donald's not going to stop me [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1799.44s)]
*  And if we want to annex the west bank I was going to say is that uh, that's on the table now [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1802.6399999999999s)]
*  Um because you know a lot of trump's biggest supporters like miriam adelson who gave him [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1806.8s)]
*  Tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars for his campaigns want the west bank to be annexed in the next few years. So [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1811.04s)]
*  um [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1817.28s)]
*  He just knows he's on better footing with trump. Tell me why do you I mean the the closest historical analogy to this from american [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1818.24s)]
*  political perspective is the iran hostage situation [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1823.76s)]
*  Where they waited until carter left for reagan to negotiate the release [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1827.4399999999998s)]
*  He'd obviously been back channeling a little bit during the election [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1831.6s)]
*  Why do you think trump was willing to do this now as opposed to just take full credit? [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1834.96s)]
*  Five days from now. I know it's weird right like in a way he kind of split the difference [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1838.8s)]
*  Because they're announcing it now, but I think the release [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1843.36s)]
*  If it starts on sunday, oh, yeah, right that's kind of timed along with the change of power [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1847.04s)]
*  So it's it but I assumed he would do the same thing which is just wait try to try to draw the jimmy carter comparison directly [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1851.36s)]
*  I I would also imagine that trump doesn't feel like joe biden is looming largest president right now. No [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1858.08s)]
*  No, I mean, you know, it's not like he's stealing his spotlight a lot. No, that's right. And you know, he is uh trump has been dispatching his [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1865.28s)]
*  many [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1872.6399999999999s)]
*  friends in surrogates to the middle east and to all sorts of countries to have conversations about [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1873.76s)]
*  Work that should be getting done by the current president. So yeah, he doesn't mind stepping on him. Does this make you [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1878.3999999999999s)]
*  look back at biden's [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1885.2s)]
*  Record in gaza and decisions in gaza any differently [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1887.28s)]
*  It makes me feel frustrated [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1891.44s)]
*  That more pressure wasn't brought to bear on the israelis earlier [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1894.0s)]
*  Um, there are there are people who are smart who I respect who will argue with me that that never would have mattered [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1898.0s)]
*  But I don't agree. Yeah [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1904.16s)]
*  Seems like it could have tried, you know, yeah [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1906.48s)]
*  All right. Thank you. Good to see you. Good to see you. Tommy dan. You want to riffle him? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1908.72s)]
*  I think I did my riffing. Come on, man [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1912.6399999999999s)]
*  You want to do a tight five on biden's farewell address? Yeah, Tommy nogorno care back what else? Um [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1915.2s)]
*  Tech oligarchs [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1920.48s)]
*  They're bad don't like them. Um, uh tech oligarchs bad [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1921.8400000000001s)]
*  what the [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1926.3200000000002s)]
*  What we think about the wobbly? Um, uh, statue of liberty as an analogy is a runner, you know [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1927.8400000000001s)]
*  We didn't get to that. Uh dan because john decided john [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1933.6000000000001s)]
*  I both decided to just have a disquisition on communication in the modern age [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1936.8000000000002s)]
*  Yes, and I wanted to make this point though that [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1941.3600000000001s)]
*  So biden opened the speech, uh with this story about the statue of liberty where he came back and closed closed with that as well [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1944.72s)]
*  I know that john meacham has helped with biden speeches. It felt very meacham coded the statue of liberty [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1951.68s)]
*  Open and close but it also reminded me of reagan's farewell address reagan's farewell address is is famous for [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1959.1200000000001s)]
*  the story at the end with one of the [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1967.0400000000002s)]
*  Uh boat people from vietnam who says like who waves at an american sailor and says freedom man or something [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1970.08s)]
*  It's a actually beautiful story at the end of fregan's [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1977.04s)]
*  The end of reagan's farewell address and it seemed so much like that that it's like sometimes when you're and this is part of my point [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1980.48s)]
*  when you're [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1986.56s)]
*  Writing speeches only for history and so therefore you look at older speeches from other presidents [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1987.76s)]
*  The trap is and we fell into the trap as well in the obama white house of times [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1993.4399999999998s)]
*  The trap is that you write in a way that sounds like [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=1997.92s)]
*  an older [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2002.24s)]
*  Speech and a president that's like a historic president because ask not yes exactly what joe biden [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2003.44s)]
*  It is the ask it's the ask not disease. It's the kennedy cosplay. Yeah, it's the playing the democratic party for yes [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2009.04s)]
*  And you know what everyone who goes to pondahawk in uh in normandy? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2014.8s)]
*  They do the same thing because reagan gave it so there's a lot of reagan cosplay and kennedy cosplay and now there's obama cosplay [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2018.96s)]
*  And now there's obama's gonna say yeah somewhere outside of a wet market in dc [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2024.48s)]
*  Someone picked up a pangolin and it and it evolved and morphed into an obama cosplay [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2028.96s)]

*  Admittedly this nomination is unconventional the nominee is [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2078.4s)]
*  Unconventional just like that new york [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2084.54s)]
*  Developer who rode down the escalator in 2015 to announce his kennedy candidacy for president [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2088.3s)]
*  That may be what makes mr. Hegseth an excellent choice [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2096.08s)]
*  Have you been involved in discussions about using the active duty military inside the united states? [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2100.48s)]

*  Liz cheney yes or no [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2121.76s)]

*  How many senators have showed up drunk to vote at night? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2127.84s)]
*  Have any of you guys asked them to step down and resign for their job? [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2131.92s)]

*  Did you ask them to step down? [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2146.16s)]
*  Yeah, you know showing up for a vote drunk. It's uh, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2148.48s)]
*  you know commanding the [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2151.76s)]
*  Greatest army in the world and the nuclear triad [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2153.92s)]
*  He's a nuclear triad without tommy in the room [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2157.68s)]
*  Someone's gonna be like he doesn't actually command the nuclear. Yeah, did you think he used that correctly? [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2161.44s)]
*  Because i'm not so sure I don't think I know but you know what? [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2165.2s)]
*  No one's asking me to be secretary of defense. Not yet [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2167.6s)]
*  Not yet an unconventional choice pete hexeth, you know, who else would be an unconventional choice someone [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2170.7200000000003s)]
*  I just meet on the street outside the studio. I'm not gonna make them secretary defense. I can hear [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2176.0s)]
*  The hearings 48 years from now and it's like [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2180.8s)]
*  He's just a podcaster. He runs a mid-sized media company [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2183.92s)]
*  How can he how can he manage three million people including the world's greatest army, it's just [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2187.12s)]
*  Unbelievable. So all these yahoos are getting confirmed, right? It seems like that [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2192.38s)]
*  I think there if there's one yahoo who may not get confirmed and I really want to put the emphasis on may [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2196.2400000000002s)]
*  It's tulsi gabbard. I think we have to see what happens in that hearing. We have to see what's going on there [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2200.88s)]
*  But I really I read somewhere that she's been uh, she's been changing minds among republican senators [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2205.28s)]
*  She's probably if you were going to have to place money place a wager [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2210.48s)]
*  You would place a wage on on a republican being confirmed by this senate [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2213.7599999999998s)]
*  But you really should put the hexeth confirmation hearings like in a time capsule [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2217.52s)]
*  To try to explain this moment in american political history to future generations [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2222.08s)]
*  Yeah, I mean here you have the senate armed service committee is like the most august of senate committees. It's there's often bipartisanship [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2225.84s)]
*  they [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2233.44s)]
*  Of all the senate committees, they're the most willing to buck a president even of their own party mainly because they are sort of [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2234.56s)]
*  In the thrall of the pentagon [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2239.92s)]
*  So here you have this committee of all committees [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2242.2400000000002s)]
*  Just in the republican majority of that committee just greasing the skids [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2245.28s)]
*  to confirm [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2249.04s)]
*  a cable news weekend host [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2250.7200000000003s)]
*  Who has a range of reported personal conduct issues including drinking on the job? [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2253.6800000000003s)]
*  To head the pentagon. It is absolutely insane. No one's asking tough questions [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2259.2000000000003s)]
*  Even the drinking on the job allegations. This is from like like last I saw 10 sources talking to nbc [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2263.6800000000003s)]
*  And we're fox employees who were saying that they were concerned about hexeth being drunk in the morning [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2270.0s)]
*  But even let's just say let's even let's say he's never had a drink in his life [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2276.64s)]
*  None of them all like just lived a perfect life. He's still woefully unqualified for this position [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2280.64s)]
*  Yeah, and yes, he served in the military, but he didn't he he's not getting nominated for this [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2287.12s)]
*  He didn't get nominated for this because he served in the military [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2291.44s)]
*  He got nominated for this because he was on tv [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2294.0s)]
*  On the on the on the president-elect's favorite tv program on the weekend edition of the president's favorite [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2296.88s)]
*  It doesn't matter if it's week or weekend. He's watching the whole time [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2302.24s)]
*  You think you think donald trump's missing saturday and sunday fox and friends up until this [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2304.72s)]
*  moment in his media career [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2310.0s)]
*  His biggest job was to show up quickly if steve deucey got the flu [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2312.64s)]
*  Like that steve deucey's we should just refer to him. I've seen he's understudied understudied [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2317.28s)]
*  And it's just it's like so much about like polarization and negative partisanship because joey urnst [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2322.5s)]
*  At least it's not a dangerous time for the world. Yeah, I mean, that's the thing that is so [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2328.02s)]
*  Fucking galling about this is you have all these republicans who all throughout the campaign talk about how dangerous the world is [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2332.1s)]
*  Our enemies are on the march china iran or shardy ever before and it's not all bullshit by the way. It's like you've got [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2337.62s)]
*  China russia north korea iran all cooperating more than they have [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2344.1s)]
*  It's a very dangerous time in the world and [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2348.98s)]
*  It's you know, like we've been competing with china and they are like it is [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2352.1s)]
*  It's it's pretty scary out there [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2356.5s)]
*  And we're sending pete hexeth [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2358.5s)]
*  You just cannot believe all these things about how serious the threats are and also believe that pete hexeth the fox news [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2360.58s)]
*  Weekend anchor who's never managed an organization of more than 100 people with a laundry list of personal conduct [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2367.78s)]
*  Concerns should be the secretary of defense. It's absolutely absurd which also by the way is [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2374.8199999999997s)]
*  The democrats on the committee like I thought we played uh, that was elissa slotkin that you heard in the middle there [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2379.7799999999997s)]
*  That was the highlight of our highlight and lowlight reel. The rest were lowlights [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2384.8199999999997s)]
*  But uh, I thought she did a fantastic job and she talked about you know, whether he would uh, you know [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2390.1s)]
*  Whether he would follow in order to shoot [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2397.94s)]
*  Uh protesters american citizens in the leg as uh, donald trump tried to ask his last secretary of defense to do mark esper [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2400.1s)]
*  um around the george floyd [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2407.3s)]
*  protests and [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2409.84s)]
*  Uh, so she had a great line of questioning. It was sober. It was calm. It was you know, and but like [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2411.86s)]
*  They were getting into the questioning of him about the affairs and like tim kane's asking him about [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2419.2200000000003s)]
*  Uh adultery and i'm like honestly, that's not my biggest problem with pete hexeth [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2426.1s)]
*  My biggest problem is he's not qualified to run the u.s military. I think [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2431.22s)]
*  the [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2437.46s)]
*  kane's line of questioning was about his infidelity of the crossbow's life the questions around [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2438.34s)]
*  He the sexual assault allegation against him are 100 entirely different relevant to this. Um, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2443.86s)]
*  Because sexual assault military is a huge problem and it's like the salt is a problem anywhere. Yes, and [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2450.2599999999998s)]
*  so [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2455.2999999999997s)]
*  But so the question is how the democrats do I guess yeah, and I think [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2456.58s)]
*  One I think these hearings [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2461.7s)]
*  Are sort of ridiculous now. Yeah, I don't know that they matter much. They don't I mean this is it's like [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2463.3799999999997s)]
*  This is a sad depressing thing to say but like so much else in politics right now [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2468.18s)]
*  They only serve for the bread and circus like entertainment for highly engaged political [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2472.66s)]
*  Junkies who's made up their minds months ago now [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2479.3599999999997s)]
*  I do think that's only because of the the way the votes are in the senate right now if democrats had held the senate [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2482.58s)]
*  And we had 51 seats [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2488.9s)]
*  I think these hearings would be a bigger deal, right? Well, it's not it's I don't know that they're yes [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2491.86s)]
*  It would be a big if the there's if the fate of the nomination was actually in here. Yeah, then yes [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2496.5s)]
*  They would be a bigger deal. I'm not sure people would pay any more attention. They would have like right now [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2503.22s)]
*  It's like low stakes gladiator combat just for people to see [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2508.42s)]
*  Democrats beat up pete hexeth republicans beat up democrats are beating up pete hexeth and doesn't serve a huge purpose [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2511.62s)]
*  the one critique I think I would make of the democrats in this and like [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2517.3s)]
*  I'm very I used to work for the senate leadership [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2521.54s)]
*  I know how hard it is to manage these things senators have very strong views on the questions [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2523.3s)]
*  They should ask and it's not like you can whiteboard this out in chuck schumer's office and everyone's going to do the right thing [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2526.98s)]
*  That's not going to happen [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2531.38s)]
*  But they're still thinking about this in a more traditional hearing where if you can just trip up the nominee to say one wrong thing [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2532.82s)]
*  You could flip votes. Yeah, and that's just not how it works with this republican party [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2540.26s)]
*  So the better use of time [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2543.46s)]
*  is to [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2545.46s)]
*  Use your questioning to try to elicit [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2546.6600000000003s)]
*  Or to focus on one specific narrative, right? [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2549.86s)]
*  and I think that got lost a little bit and it's hard because it's like [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2553.1400000000003s)]
*  Democrats have some time you do your thing and then a republican just [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2555.86s)]
*  You know goes on about it like mark wade mullen about drunk senators for a while then you come back [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2559.14s)]
*  But if you're on a different topic, it's very hard to lay out a coherent thread [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2563.14s)]
*  so I think maybe simplifying or shortening the [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2566.9s)]
*  Topic areas of concern would be something that I would recommend at some of these hearings going forward like rfk jr [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2570.18s)]
*  Again, I don't think it works for everything [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2575.46s)]
*  But a good rule of thumb is the line of questioning or the message or whatever it may be [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2576.9s)]
*  Should have something to do with [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2582.5s)]
*  um [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2584.82s)]
*  The person's potential effects [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2585.94s)]
*  on people's lives [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2588.66s)]
*  Going forward so much, you know what I'm saying? [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2590.26s)]
*  It's like this is why the talking about how dangerous the world is and whether he is the person equipped to lead [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2592.5s)]
*  The united states military in a very dangerous world. That's something that would at least if someone was paying attention [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2599.06s)]
*  Someone was forced to watch like us. Um, we get them thinking. Oof. This is kind of scary [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2604.42s)]
*  Do I want this guy in charge of the military? [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2608.9s)]
*  Um because it might affect me, you know, and I I don't know that we've quite gotten there yet [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2611.14s)]
*  I think same thing with the pam bondi hearings by the way [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2616.7400000000002s)]
*  It's bizarre that pam bondi is now like, uh, she's gonna be a slam dunk because matt gates who is the only one? [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2619.46s)]
*  Who's gone down and that's because the [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2627.14s)]
*  Bipartisan house ethics committee concluded that he paid for sex with an underage woman [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2630.2400000000002s)]
*  Um, that's the only reason he went down. I mean she's only gonna get like three more votes than he did [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2637.3s)]
*  Right. Yeah, I know [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2641.3s)]
*  uh [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2642.7400000000002s)]
*  But so now pam bondi seems great even though she was like a they were asking her about being a registered foreign agent for the government [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2643.94s)]
*  of uh cutter [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2650.1000000000004s)]
*  Uh, she was she still wouldn't say that biden was [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2651.86s)]
*  Uh legitimately elected. She just said he is the president [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2655.7000000000003s)]
*  Uh, she you know hinted that there's fraud in pennsylvania in 2020 [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2658.9s)]

*  I'm sure we're gonna be able to find footage of her at a rally where he said that [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2681.3799999999997s)]

*  What she's you're gonna say? Hey you you believed that donald trump won the election [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2697.7s)]
*  She's gonna say no I didn't or she's gonna not answer the question and then we're gonna go back and forth [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2702.3399999999997s)]
*  What are we getting out of it now? I don't even know. Yeah, that's [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2706.42s)]

*  But he's like a legitimate like a republican wins and a republican gets their cabinet [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2716.02s)]
*  Marco rubio is a perfectly legitimate get confirmed. Yes, exactly [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2722.02s)]
*  And now also by the way, I said this to you earlier, but [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2727.3799999999997s)]
*  I was looking at the the resumes of all these people because [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2730.4199999999996s)]
*  Knowing that all the cabinet picks are getting in you don't pay as much attention to it [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2735.14s)]
*  But like chris wright this guy's gonna be the energy secretary literal oil industry ceo [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2738.74s)]
*  It's on the nose. Like it's very the treasury secretary is a [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2744.3399999999997s)]

*  What just no one here just nothing [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2752.4199999999996s)]
*  Populism champion of the working class. I was gonna say yeah, they're a workers party now. Yes, the republicans oil executives and [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2755.54s)]
*  hedge fund billionaires in the cabinet [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2763.2799999999997s)]
*  Cool. All right. We'll see. Let's see. They they've got it covered. They're gonna fix the country. That's what they promised. I'm [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2766.02s)]
*  There are selfless patriots who you know could be could be making even more money than they already have [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2773.06s)]
*  But they have decided to take a leave to help fix the country [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2777.54s)]
*  So I'm eager to see what results well [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2780.5s)]
*  I would just say that I am going to check the price of eggs bacon gas groceries and median rent in this country at [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2782.1s)]
*  1201 on monday and we should do like an update every couple weeks 100 he he owns it [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2789.04s)]
*  I mean, that's one of the questions that was asked in [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2794.34s)]
*  the scott besant hearing was do you believe that [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2796.98s)]
*  Donald trump is as responsible for prices as joe biden was he obviously did answer that question [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2800.5s)]
*  But you know that is an opera that is a central question to our political strategy going forward for sure [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2804.66s)]
*  All right before we get to my interview with ben wickler [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2808.98s)]
*  Uh, we got to talk about tik tok which is set to be banned in the u.s [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2810.74s)]
*  Unless the chinese-owned video sharing app is sold to an american owner by january 19th, which is this sunday [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2813.7799999999997s)]
*  We are recording this thursday afternoon by the time you hear this on friday [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2820.1s)]
*  It's also possible the supreme court may have handed down their decision [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2823.22s)]
*  Uh, it does not seem like the supreme court's gonna save tik tok from the oral arguments [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2826.5s)]
*  We've talked about this before but we shall see [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2830.02s)]
*  The ban which passed last year with a huge bipartisan majority does allow a 90-day extension [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2832.7400000000002s)]
*  If there's a potential sale biden administration says they're not going to delay the ban because they don't think they can because they don't see [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2839.2200000000003s)]
*  a potential sale [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2846.5s)]
*  But the incoming trump administration says they intend to find a way to extend the deadline and get that deal [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2847.94s)]
*  Uh, this is according to trump national security advisor michael waltz who said quote [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2853.78s)]
*  It's been a great platform for trump in his campaign to get his america first message out [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2858.02s)]
*  But at the same time trump and conservatives don't want the chinese communists getting their passwords getting their data [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2863.0600000000004s)]
*  And being able to overly influence the american people again horses out of the barn on that one. Um, [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2868.5800000000004s)]
*  What do you think will donald trump protect the right of every american to have chinese spyware on their phone? [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2874.98s)]
*  I think he is going to try as hard as he can to succeed here. He understands the politics here [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2880.1800000000003s)]
*  He understood it very deftly in the 2024 campaign when he after the law was passed he came out and opposed it [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2884.9s)]
*  and [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2892.1000000000004s)]
*  he wants to be the person who saved tiktok for the [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2893.3s)]
*  60 percent of voters under 30 who use tiktok. Yeah for the 170 million americans who use tiktok on a monthly basis [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2896.82s)]
*  And the tiktok ban is quite many of whom voted for him [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2904.1800000000003s)]
*  the tiktok ban is [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2907.86s)]
*  Quite unpopular it was when it when the law passed it was 50 support the tiktok ban. It's down to less than a third [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2909.7s)]
*  Of americans. It's 10 of tiktok users support it [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2915.7s)]
*  Yeah, which is a you know, as I said, uh six and ten of voters under 30 who use it the politics here are [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2919.8599999999997s)]
*  Terrible for democrats even though this was a bipartisan bill [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2926.74s)]
*  Even though it's very important to note donald trump tried to shut down the app himself when he was president [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2929.62s)]
*  the way it has played out over the last year, however, it's been is [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2933.8599999999997s)]
*  Joe biden wants to shut down tiktok [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2938.4199999999996s)]
*  And donald trump was a savant [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2940.8199999999997s)]
*  and that [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2943.06s)]
*  I don't think [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2944.1s)]
*  You know, we're on tiktok like we we look at it [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2946.8199999999997s)]
*  But we like most people particularly people in politics particularly the senators and congress people about this do not understand what this means [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2950.1s)]
*  Shutting down tiktok for a lot of younger americans would be like when we were younger [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2957.22s)]
*  A president decided cable tv was going to disappear [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2962.58s)]
*  on a random sunday [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2965.8599999999997s)]
*  It's how they get their sports. It's how they get their news. It's how they stay in touch with their friends [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2967.62s)]
*  It is how they follow. It's their entertainment completely wrong information about the world around them [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2971.46s)]
*  Well, you know what also doesn't give great information cable news [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2975.7799999999997s)]
*  So it's like cable tv doesn't either and it's just it is a much bigger deal than I think a lot of people in politics [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2978.18s)]
*  Think about because most people in politics don't actually use [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2983.38s)]
*  tiktok and the end [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2986.18s)]
*  In the passing of it the democrats and republicans involved did just an absolutely miserable job of justifying the ban [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2989.22s)]
*  Oh for sure, you can't I said this at the time you can't say it's really really bad trust us [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=2995.3799999999997s)]
*  but we can't tell you why no one trusts you and so [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3001.3799999999997s)]
*  if we're in a situation where [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3005.06s)]
*  Donald trump saves it is going to be to his political benefit. No doubt [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3007.22s)]
*  You got to hand it to xi Jinping. Yeah, you do and and the chinese communist party because if this is an op they [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3010.66s)]
*  Fucking nailed it. They created an app that has completely addicted young americans [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3017.3799999999997s)]
*  And when you try to take away something that someone's addicted to they're going to be pretty fucking pissed [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3025.0s)]
*  And that's what they're doing now and and without a reason that like you said makes sense to people [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3030.6000000000004s)]
*  um, and now what's happening is a lot of young people are like going over to um, what is it red note? [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3036.2000000000003s)]
*  Yes, which is like [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3042.92s)]
*  That's a little on the nose if you will [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3044.76s)]
*  It's like the servers are in china [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3047.48s)]
*  It's like it's like run by the party it's not just influence, you know, and uh, they're over there and then [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3050.04s)]
*  Now you're starting to see people be like, oh, you know, what's wrong with the chinese government? [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3057.32s)]
*  Anyway, like it's it seems like they're they're uh, [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3061.4s)]
*  Things are going pretty well over there and things and food is cheaper than it is here in america [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3064.68s)]
*  I mean, it's just it's wild was tnm and square. Yeah, was that real? [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3069.08s)]
*  I don't know if that was real. Are we sure that wasn't those weren't paid actors? [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3073.88s)]
*  Like that's the kind of shit that we're getting now. I mean I am willing to believe that [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3077.08s)]
*  tiktok is is as dangerous as everyone says it is even if they won't tell us why like that knowing what we know about [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3082.6800000000003s)]
*  Governments and what china the sort of things china does that makes sense to me [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3089.2200000000003s)]
*  But you really should have solved this problem [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3093.0s)]
*  Five years ago. Yeah, like waiting until yep [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3096.36s)]
*  You had 170 million americans on the app and had them using it for much of their [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3099.56s)]
*  Social media existence and then deciding to take it away was just asinine and here's where we are [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3104.6s)]
*  The saddest irony is it's too hard to communicate to people how dangerous that might be because of the information environment that has given rise to tiktok [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3109.4s)]
*  And the tiktok has been held safe. I mean it would be fucking hilarious if it weren't so scary [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3118.6s)]
*  I agree. I totally agree in the politics. You're at you're 100% right in the politics [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3125.56s)]
*  It's like if you're in the in the government and you're genuinely concerned about this [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3128.92s)]
*  I don't know what else you do [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3133.88s)]
*  But at this point but say like yeah, of course we want to ban this but you're going to play whack-a-mole with chinese apps for the rest [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3135.6400000000003s)]
*  of time [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3141.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's like the everyone's leaving take time to go to [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3141.96s)]
*  Less secure chinese apps to use [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3146.04s)]
*  And so what we're going to come back around next year [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3148.76s)]
*  We're going to ban red note and lemonade or whatever it is and we're just going to go to another app [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3150.76s)]
*  We're just going to do it until the end of time. I mean the only real solution here is to [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3156.44s)]
*  Sell tiktok us operations and open it back up again [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3161.4s)]
*  That's the only and it does seem like and it could be sold elon musk that's been floated. Yeah, I know I know [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3164.36s)]
*  Well, it doesn't like the trump administration is saying [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3170.52s)]
*  I thought they might just say, you know, they could have pam bondy attorney general pam bondy could save tiktok [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3173.88s)]
*  By just not enforcing the ban now that only lasts as long as the trump administration lasts [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3181.2400000000002s)]
*  Um, I kind of expected that they might do that the fact that they are [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3186.6s)]

*  Joining us today the chair of the wisconsin democratic party who is currently running for chair of the democratic national committee ben wickler [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3420.72s)]
*  Welcome back to pod save america pal john. That's great to be back [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3427.06s)]
*  So as a democrat I feel grateful and excited that you're running for dnc chair as a friend i'm concerned because it is a thankless job [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3430.6600000000003s)]
*  That makes you a punching bag for things that aren't necessarily your fault [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3438.98s)]
*  Uh, you and I haven't talked about this yet. But what was your decision making process? Uh that led you to run [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3442.5s)]
*  So the night of the election [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3448.98s)]
*  I felt like a punch in the gut because I had felt the energy all over wisconsin [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3450.7400000000002s)]
*  I thought we were going to win in wisconsin, which was my obsession [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3454.34s)]
*  And then we lost and I remember that night feeling like maybe none of this has had any impact [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3457.22s)]
*  Maybe this is all for nothing [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3463.2999999999997s)]
*  And then the next day I got up and started digging through the numbers [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3464.98s)]
*  And what I saw was that while democratic turnout had gone down in most states including all our neighboring states like minnesota over the [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3467.94s)]
*  Course of the election it went up in wisconsin. We actually had the highest turnout in the country and because of that [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3474.66s)]
*  Tammy baldwin won reelection. We flipped 14 state legislative seats [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3479.7s)]
*  You know trump republican turnout went up even more and that's why that's why we lost [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3483.54s)]
*  But the work had made a giant difference and wisconsin actually was to the left of the national popular vote for the first time in a long time [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3487.62s)]
*  And I that led me to start thinking like what if we could do this everywhere like how big the stakes are for people? [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3495.7799999999997s)]
*  For working people who across race and ethnicity and all over the country who are about to get punched in the face by this administration [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3502.4199999999996s)]
*  If we can if we can build the kind of strength of a party that we built in wisconsin [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3509.48s)]
*  Across the country [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3513.96s)]
*  Then we can both contain the damage and also make this the the beginning of something much better where we actually make this country work [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3515.3199999999997s)]
*  for everyone and that [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3520.8399999999997s)]
*  That sense of the impact that it can have is why i'm running for dnc chair [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3522.44s)]
*  Even though you've been one of the most frequent guests on pod save america [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3526.04s)]
*  I feel like a lot of our audience might think you emerged on this earth fully formed as the [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3529.56s)]
*  Chair of the wisconsin democratic party [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3535.0s)]
*  Can you talk a little bit about like what got you into politics in the first place and why? [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3537.0s)]
*  So my godmother is a woman named itadir [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3541.96s)]
*  And when I was 11 she ran for congress and became the first native american woman to win a congressional primary [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3544.76s)]
*  So that was volunteering on her race was my first experience in politics like stuffing envelopes and putting up yard signs [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3549.88s)]
*  And she she had led the fight to restore her tribe's recognition by the federal government [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3555.5600000000004s)]
*  It was it was terminated in the 50s and had passed a federal law to restore recognition [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3560.92s)]
*  And it just was this kind of force of nature incredible person [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3566.6800000000003s)]
*  So learning from her and from my parents who are both like belatedly believe deeply in in change and then [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3570.12s)]
*  Getting involved first as an organizer in like to fight for public school funding in wisconsin and volunteering for tammy baldman [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3576.84s)]
*  When I was in high school when she first ran for congress, uh interning for russ feingold seeing these people who were heroes to me [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3582.6s)]
*  Who got involved and actually won fights? [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3588.92s)]
*  It made me more idealistic the more I got involved as opposed to less which is often how it happens in politics for people [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3592.04s)]
*  and I I got hooked so I my [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3598.2000000000003s)]
*  My i've always had three big things one is actual electoral politics. The second is new media [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3601.08s)]
*  So my I was I wrote for the onion when I was in high school in college [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3606.44s)]
*  Yeah [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3609.32s)]
*  Starting in madison where I grew up and uh worked at air america radio after college trying to build a uh, this might sound familiar a [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3609.6400000000003s)]
*  Progressive media ecosystem to combat the dominance of the right in our and shaping political narratives and then the other is is advocacy [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3616.2000000000003s)]
*  Which is what I was doing at move on which is you know both trying to win elections [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3622.92s)]
*  But also actually fighting on the issues that affect people's lives [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3626.04s)]
*  And what led me to run for chair of the democratic party of wisconsin and to move home to wisconsin in 2018 [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3628.92s)]
*  I always wanted to raise my kid there, but it was the experience at move on of trump coming in [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3634.28s)]
*  And winning wisconsin in 2016 [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3639.0s)]
*  In my state that had been rigged by the gop for total control after scott walker came in with voter suppression with gerrymandered rig [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3641.96s)]
*  legislative maps [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3649.08s)]
*  With union busting as a centerpiece of their strategy to shut down the voices of working people [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3650.36s)]
*  the [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3655.72s)]
*  the seeing how that then played out in putting trump in the white house and [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3656.76s)]
*  Shredding the the public education system in in my state that I had like grown up fighting for [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3661.16s)]
*  uh, I wanted to move home and try to try to change the direction of all that [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3666.28s)]
*  and I [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3670.52s)]
*  The only way to protect like the the fundamental things people rely on like [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3672.76s)]
*  Being able to get to a doctor when they get sick is to win power in states across the country [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3676.84s)]
*  That's where political power actually resides [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3680.6s)]
*  And that's what led me to run for for chair in my state because all of these fights are interconnected and we need a party [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3682.92s)]
*  Strong enough to fight it at all these levels [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3688.12s)]
*  So I used to come on your show right when you launched as we were fighting back against aca repeal [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3689.96s)]
*  And the whole thing was like mobilizing people in their congressional districts and pushing u.s [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3694.28s)]
*  Senators and telling their stories and getting into the press and all this stuff [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3698.2s)]
*  It's state by state by state and I want to I want to build i'm running now for dean cichar [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3701.16s)]
*  Because I want a national party that can build that kind of strength both to limit the damage and also to build the trust [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3705.24s)]
*  From from folks who want to see someone fighting for them [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3711.08s)]
*  To build a party that earns that trust and helps elect democrats at every level you mentioned [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3714.2799999999997s)]
*  Uh the high turnout in wisconsin this time around and how it's slightly left to the popular vote [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3718.6s)]
*  Um, i've seen some post-election analysis from some folks on the left that argues harris lost because [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3724.04s)]
*  Too many voters in the anti-trump coalition stayed home [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3730.7599999999998s)]
*  It seems like that's not what happened in the battleground states. Certainly not what happened in wisconsin [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3733.8799999999997s)]
*  um [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3738.2799999999997s)]
*  I know harris got more votes than biden in wisconsin, but there were even more new trump voters than anticipated [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3739.24s)]
*  Given that what does it tell you about why we lost and what we need to do going forward? [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3747.48s)]
*  So this is the first election of my lifetime in the last half century [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3753.0s)]
*  Where republican vote share went up in every state and dc the whole country moved a little bit towards the republicans [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3756.84s)]
*  That involved a combination of more people voting who hadn't voted before and voting for trump [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3765.0s)]
*  There were there were people who crossed over in both directions [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3770.36s)]
*  But there were more people who switched over to vote for trump and there were people who stayed home who otherwise [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3773.56s)]
*  Probably would have voted for democrats [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3779.0s)]
*  And there's a lot of different pieces of why that is and we need a lot more data to get the full story [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3780.92s)]
*  But one thing that jumps out really clearly [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3784.52s)]
*  Is that the people who were hit hardest by prices going up and and no one talks about this [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3786.92s)]
*  By the pandemic era support falling away because republicans shut down things like the child care tax credit the democrats were fighting for [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3791.7200000000003s)]
*  Those programs really made a difference in the lives of of the middle class and of the poor of working families across this country [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3799.08s)]
*  Like incomes went up for a while child poverty was cut in half [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3806.12s)]
*  And then the support went away [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3810.04s)]
*  And so people you know if you're getting a thousand dollars a month because you have two kids and you make forty thousand dollars a year [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3811.72s)]
*  That's a huge huge deal for your family [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3817.2400000000002s)]
*  And when that goes away [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3820.04s)]
*  Suddenly the floor is falling out at the same time as the the price of keeping a roof over your head and filling your [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3821.64s)]
*  prescriptions and getting the food you need is going up [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3826.58s)]
*  so that's why the economy sucked for a ton of people because they had they had helped that disappeared and [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3829.16s)]
*  The the cost of getting through the day rose and those voters who had a lot of other things on their mind [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3834.44s)]
*  Were the least likely to pay attention to political news [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3839.48s)]
*  They were least likely to be you know tuning in to to this show or to or to the msnbc's of the world or reading a newspaper [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3841.8s)]
*  and they [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3848.52s)]
*  Didn't experience they felt like things were getting worse when [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3849.88s)]
*  A certain party was in charge and they didn't show up to keep that party in power [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3853.4s)]
*  We saw the same thing happening everywhere in the world [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3857.64s)]
*  The incumbent party's lost ground, you know for the first time in more than a century in every in every wealthy developed [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3860.2s)]
*  democracy and on planet earth [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3865.8799999999997s)]
*  But in the united states, it's particularly infuriating because democrats actually were fighting for the exact things that folks needed and republicans [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3868.2799999999997s)]
*  Stopped them. They blocked them and took them away if we had a couple more democratic votes in the senate [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3876.8399999999997s)]
*  We could have we could have provided long-term support for folks [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3881.08s)]
*  And what is really clear to me is that we were not communicating to people [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3884.44s)]
*  To to talk the talk to show up and show that we're fighting for working people in their lives [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3888.84s)]
*  In in places in ways that they actually heard and saw and felt and that that is an indictment on us for how we [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3894.2000000000003s)]
*  Communicate and also shows the power of the right-wing [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3901.2200000000003s)]
*  You know propaganda and organizing machine that they've been able to dominate this conversation and tell people [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3904.92s)]
*  Your lifestyle is because of some some them that democrats are on the side of against you and it's it is both [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3909.32s)]
*  You know republicans trying to divide people based on their identities [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3915.08s)]
*  But it's also a message about saying democrats don't actually care about you [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3918.36s)]
*  Whoever you might be and the way we beat that is not by abandoning parts of our coalition [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3921.2400000000002s)]
*  By people that that deserve the same freedom and respect everyone gets the way we defeat that is by showing that we are fighting for people [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3925.6400000000003s)]
*  And republicans are the ones trying to rip them off and divide and distract them in order to pick their pockets [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3931.32s)]
*  So I want to dig into that. Um, it seems like you know, there's there's like three components to a message [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3936.1200000000003s)]
*  There's what we say there's how we say it and then there's how we make sure people hear it [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3940.44s)]
*  Um put the last one aside for a second and the first two uh, what we say and how we say it [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3945.2400000000002s)]
*  I've been banging this drum since 2016. I know you have two a lot of democratic [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3950.6000000000004s)]
*  Strategists and organizers have it it seems pretty clear that the story we want to tell is the democrats are on the side of working people [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3955.0600000000004s)]
*  and republicans are for the rich and [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3962.1200000000003s)]
*  We know from talking to people that that works [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3964.84s)]
*  Well, we know from polling we know from focus groups. Everyone knows it and yet [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3967.96s)]
*  It's really hard to get that message out [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3972.7599999999998s)]
*  um, and we are now in an era where debates about culture and identity attract more attention than debates about [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3975.0s)]
*  Uh economics and economic issues like maybe back in you know, last time last time we had an election based on uh, [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3982.12s)]
*  Debate about economic issues was uh, 2012 maybe when we were able to do that [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3988.3599999999997s)]
*  And unless you would argue that that's actually part of what trump is doing and uh, [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3994.12s)]
*  Yes, he was trying to reverse that and tell a story where democrats are the party of the rich [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=3997.56s)]
*  Is it about being more creative in how we talk about economic issues? Is it? [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4002.12s)]
*  Uh, is it the language democrats are using? What do you think? So it's everything but I will put one particular [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4006.44s)]
*  Circle around something which is you have to actually have a fight [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4012.52s)]
*  That means there have to be two sides of the fight that attention follows conflict that the to me [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4015.48s)]
*  2018 was an election about health care and about republicans trying to rip away people's health care [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4020.82s)]
*  In order to give tax cuts to the ultra rich and and big insurance companies [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4025.56s)]
*  And that was the the voices at the in the forefront of that fight [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4029.56s)]
*  Were people whose health care was going to be ripped away by what republicans were doing [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4033.16s)]
*  It was electrifying and the we we organized across the country as it move on we helped to organize [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4036.7599999999998s)]
*  23,000 protests with grassroots groups with people with disabilities in the front of that fight who were whose lives were on the line [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4042.66s)]
*  Who put their bodies on the line in that fight and democrats made absolutely clear [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4048.9199999999996s)]
*  That they were they were four people being able to get health care when they needed it and republicans were against republicans started trying to copy [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4052.92s)]
*  Our message people could see who was fighting for them and who was trying to to to screw them over [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4058.6s)]
*  And and we won and that and in 2006 same thing social security privatization [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4063.8s)]
*  Republicans had this big plan that they were going to you know move social security into the stock market right before [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4068.6s)]
*  the financial crisis great idea republicans [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4073.88s)]
*  and [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4076.36s)]
*  democrats said absolutely not and went to bat and the voices of people who were going to be directly affected were front and center of [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4076.92s)]
*  the race in in the battle and you know [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4082.44s)]
*  That was a huge part of how we won in 2006 also the fight against republican corruption [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4084.92s)]
*  Which was endemic and we know there will be fights like that at this moment [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4088.84s)]
*  But there actually has to be a big battle for people to be able to see it [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4092.68s)]
*  Especially to reach outside of the bubble just having a bill that has a bunch of great provisions that you talk about [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4095.56s)]
*  It doesn't do it because republicans never publicly message that they're against good ideas that democrats have they kill [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4100.68s)]
*  our good proposals in private and then they duke it out on the the [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4106.6s)]
*  You know cultural fights that they want to bring attention to in the most public way possible which and then by the way, you know [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4110.12s)]
*  They don't believe half the stuff that they're that they're saying [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4116.04s)]
*  They know it's all bs [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4117.88s)]
*  But the but but the attacks that republicans do are centrally to try to provoke fights that bring attention to their issues [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4119.16s)]
*  And we need to fight on our issues to fight for example [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4125.24s)]
*  not just to protect social security, but to expand social security and and you know like to to [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4128.6s)]
*  to tax [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4134.84s)]
*  Higher income so we can expand the support that everybody gets in ways that put republicans on defense [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4136.2s)]
*  If we can do that kind of fight it takes building a war room. It takes [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4141.88s)]
*  It takes communicating clearly. I think using the language people use in their real life is really critical [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4145.4s)]
*  But this is this is work that we've been doing year over year in wisconsin. It takes on the ground organizing [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4150.44s)]
*  We have the biggest on the ground organizing team [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4155.32s)]
*  It takes communicating across a ton of different platforms and it means going on offense on fights that actually [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4157.16s)]
*  People have an emotional intense response to that they actually care about and then they get involved in those fights as well [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4164.12s)]
*  Because if if we can message all we want but if people aren't talking about it in their you know in baron's chat and world [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4169.639999999999s)]
*  Of warcraft then we're probably not actually [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4175.72s)]
*  Having the kind of fight that draws the country's attention and changes the conversation in terms of how we make sure people hear democrats message [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4178.68s)]
*  You laid out three steps in a in a in a post a month ago. I think [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4186.2s)]
*  Build up progressive media obviously love to hear it. That's biased on that one [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4190.76s)]
*  Number two more media appearances on shows that have you know conservative or conservative leaning audience [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4195.4800000000005s)]
*  And three figure out how to reach people who aren't consuming political news or really any kind of news at all [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4201.88s)]
*  You mentioned this earlier to me. This is the most important one and I think maybe the most difficult [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4207.88s)]
*  What are your thoughts on how to reach people who who just aren't paying attention to any of this bullshit? [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4213.72s)]
*  So the the biggest thing is to [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4219.0s)]
*  Go to places where people are talking about other stuff and talk about other stuff as well as about politics and that means [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4221.72s)]
*  It does mean video games. It means [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4228.040000000001s)]
*  Home makeovers gigantic audience people think about that all the time who have are lucky enough to have homes that they can make over [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4230.68s)]
*  uh cooking parenting [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4236.4400000000005s)]
*  sports beauty fashion like the whole world of culture the world that people actually [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4238.52s)]
*  Inhabit when they're not thinking about how they're going to vote [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4243.4800000000005s)]
*  The conversations that happened in those places are the things that are sort of you know cultures upstream from politics the places [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4245.879999999999s)]
*  Where there's non-political conversations they play shape the landscape in which political dramas play out [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4251.959999999999s)]
*  And this is something that I think trump has a particular talent and knack for but also people like roger ailes a lot of other [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4256.599999999999s)]
*  Republicans they think about how to push narratives that that [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4262.44s)]
*  affects the the broader culture [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4266.2s)]
*  And as democrats, I think we need an intentional cultural strategy and some of that can happen and should happen at the party [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4268.44s)]
*  Some of that should happen outside the party [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4274.28s)]
*  But as a democratic party we should be working to help you know [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4275.96s)]
*  Get folks to get democratic candidates and elected officials and communicators and storytellers [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4279.56s)]
*  Into places that that shape the broader conversation across the country [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4284.44s)]
*  That means you know having dinners where people can meet each other [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4288.12s)]
*  Influencers can can meet elected officials and learn about the things that they're working on [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4291.38s)]
*  For a lot of this stuff is a total black box to people that are outside of politics and you actually have to demystify it [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4295.08s)]
*  And put a human face on things and and build relationships [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4299.96s)]
*  So people make a phone call to see if something's true before they go out and say it and that's work that has to happen [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4302.84s)]
*  Before elections so you don't get to the final hundred seven days and have culture already swung away from you [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4307.8s)]
*  That's that work should start [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4313.88s)]
*  Right now and the fact you know the the dnc chair's election is february 1st [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4315.72s)]
*  So I will be on day one this very public commitment [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4319.72s)]
*  We'll start an audit of every consulting contract that the democratic party has and we will [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4322.6s)]
*  Actually choose where to spend our money based on our values on the path to victory not relationships or you know old [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4326.679999999999s)]
*  Political debts that someone incurred a long time ago [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4332.36s)]
*  but the other thing that we'll start doing is building a battle plan in each state and a [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4335.16s)]
*  Strategy around attention and communication that shifts where these conversations are taking place. It is it's just [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4339.639999999999s)]
*  You know, we don't live in [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4346.759999999999s)]
*  In the 90s or the 2000s or the 2010 like this is this is now attention's fragmented into a million different places [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4348.5199999999995s)]
*  half the electorate doesn't watch tv and we need to [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4355.88s)]
*  We need to look to where attention is going and then actually build relationships [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4359.08s)]
*  that are based on common values and shared interests and have and make sure that democrats are talking about why their values as a [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4362.76s)]
*  as a hunter and sports person lead them to want to make sure that we don't [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4371.16s)]
*  Destroy the the natural resources across the state of wisconsin to take one close to home example [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4374.6s)]
*  Across all the different dimensions because people care about a million things [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4379.72s)]
*  But they have a common set of values that are fundamentally about the idea that everyone should have freedom and dignity and respect and and be able to [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4382.6s)]
*  You know afford the basic things that everyone needs in life [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4390.360000000001s)]
*  That's universal stuff that touches just about everything that people do [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4393.08s)]
*  When you do that audit if you do that audit, what uh, what are you looking for? Like what is the [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4396.68s)]
*  What kind of consultants what kind of ad makers? [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4402.4400000000005s)]
*  Uh, do you would you think are like, okay, that's that's good. The party needs that. Uh, [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4406.04s)]
*  I won't make you say what which ones you want to get rid of but what what are you looking for from a from a positive? [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4411.16s)]
*  positive angle [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4416.44s)]
*  well, we know that [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4417.799999999999s)]
*  We we are losing ground with folks across race and ethnicity and across geography across the country [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4419.96s)]
*  And so we should be working with with ad makers with communicators with pollsters and researchers that reflect the full diversity of our coalition [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4426.12s)]
*  That understand the communities that they're trying to work in [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4433.16s)]
*  We know that uh, there's a huge generational problem and that if democrats, you know [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4435.719999999999s)]
*  We did better with older voters and worse with younger voters and we need to make sure we're working with [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4440.2s)]
*  Younger folks and new voices and people have familiarity across different new platforms [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4444.599999999999s)]
*  I also want to make sure we're actually looking at results and you know [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4448.5199999999995s)]
*  How we measure those results and what those results are I there's not a lot of budget transparency within the dnc right now [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4452.36s)]
*  and I [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4458.92s)]
*  A commitment that i've made on my platform at benwickbay.com platform is that we will both upgrade that transparency and bring [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4459.88s)]
*  dnc members in to build a [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4466.76s)]
*  Like you know a policy around how we build those consultancies and contracts and then to be able to raise money when there's not a democratic president [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4469.0s)]
*  This is and a lot of people are skeptical a lot of money was spent in the last election [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4476.12s)]
*  We didn't win it. This is not horseshoes. It doesn't count if you get close [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4479.320000000001s)]
*  Uh, if we want to be able to earn people's trust [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4483.0s)]
*  We like they're not atm's people are going to invest when they know that money is going to be spent well [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4485.96s)]
*  And so I want to basically [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4490.52s)]
*  Uh be be spending money at the dnc [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4492.52s)]
*  We'll have to raise and spend a lot in a way that we're very clearly doing all of that in a [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4495.320000000001s)]
*  Coming from our values and our path to victory and that's a battle plan in each state across all the different kinds of fights that we need [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4501.400000000001s)]
*  To fight that's understanding how different races at different levels are interconnected [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4506.280000000001s)]
*  The wisconsin has a state supreme court election april 1st [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4510.200000000001s)]
*  If republicans win that they read your amanda the state if they read your amanda the state [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4513.0s)]
*  They could rig our electoral system for the long term like north carolina [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4516.52s)]
*  There we're in a fight to retain a an election against a rogue supreme court because republicans took it over in 2022 [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4520.36s)]
*  there's so many of these fights that are all part of this this [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4527.16s)]
*  Vast maze about how you win the power to make change in people's lives [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4530.76s)]
*  and we need to be working from a battle plan not just cutting checks to to states to you know to [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4534.04s)]
*  To say good luck here you go [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4539.88s)]
*  But actually funding program that leads to winning so that we can make a change in people's lives [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4541.24s)]
*  Which is the entire point of this work and that's that's the set of principles that I want to use to inform how we spend [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4545.88s)]
*  politics it's a people have relationships and I [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4552.28s)]
*  I honor that but it's not about who knows who it should not be about who knows who and who owes someone a favor [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4555.88s)]
*  Who scratched someone's back? [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4561.64s)]
*  It should be about how we actually build a party strong enough [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4563.0s)]
*  To fight for the things that people need across this country that are going to be attacked by the trump administration [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4566.76s)]
*  How we communicate how we show up how we organize? [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4571.8s)]
*  Year-round on the ground everywhere in the country as we've done in wisconsin [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4574.44s)]
*  As we need to do across the nation that's that is the point of this work [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4577.8s)]
*  And if we do it right then we could win enormous amounts of elections and and really make change over the next four years and beyond [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4581.24s)]
*  What other changes do you want to make at the dnc and what's what specifically would you do differently than jamie harrison has over the last? [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4587.08s)]
*  Four years I want to honor that when there's a democratic presidency [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4594.04s)]
*  Some decisions aren't made by the dnc chair. That's true a lot of decisions come, you know out of out of folks at the white house and [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4597.72s)]
*  um, I think [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4604.28s)]
*  I think president biden has done has passed a lot of really critical legislation. I also think that the the dnc has not [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4606.12s)]
*  Engaged in this kind of fight up and down the ballot in the in the way that we have the opportunity to do [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4612.92s)]
*  And I also think that the work to build the kind of communications [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4617.56s)]
*  Strategy to do the non-political work the the building up progressive media ecosystem and training and deploying communicators on conservative media [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4621.14s)]
*  There's a lot of work to do there as well and you can see that in [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4629.08s)]
*  You know in what happened in the election and you can also see that in in the way that [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4632.200000000001s)]
*  If you talk to folks across the country, there's a ton of races where [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4636.360000000001s)]
*  As a national party, we haven't leaned into the fight and that's that's the thing [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4639.72s)]
*  I think we have the opportunity to change. I have great respect for chair harrison and I think there's a [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4643.96s)]
*  There's a lot of battles that simply have not been a core priority for the democratic national committee [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4650.04s)]
*  That we're going to be living with the consequences of that for for a long time to come and this is this is no shade on [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4655.08s)]
*  The people on the ground or the people who worked in the building [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4659.88s)]
*  This is about this is about having a strategy to be able to fight and win at all the different levels of the ballot [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4663.16s)]
*  recognizing their interconnected and that the dnc is a part of an ecosystem with the with [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4668.18s)]
*  Unions and the labor movement with grassroots partners and allies that we need to build a plan together to be able to fight and win [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4673.24s)]
*  Um in a way that that's happened more in the governing side than has happened in the in the political and communication and [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4679.72s)]
*  Organizing and campaign side would you be in favor of uh reinstating the ban on? [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4685.06s)]
*  donations from corporate PACs and lobbyists [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4689.4s)]
*  The core of that question is do you think that the democratic party's agenda should be controlled by corporate PACs and lobbyists? [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4691.88s)]
*  And my answer to that is absolutely not this we should be fighting for working folks [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4696.68s)]
*  And we should be fighting to win at every level of the ballot. I also know that if you [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4701.16s)]
*  if you look across the country, uh, the the [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4706.68s)]
*  the core thing that we need to do is [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4710.28s)]
*  Fight in a way that brings friends to our side and that will lead to you know various companies [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4712.44s)]
*  I'm sure investing in supporting republicans as they're doing right now in a big way [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4717.72s)]
*  Um, and that there are there are states there are different fights [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4721.240000000001s)]
*  There are places where the right has gone so far that the only way that you know [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4723.96s)]
*  The business community winds up siding with moderates and democrats against far-right republicans [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4728.04s)]
*  So I actually think that the way corporate money affects our politics is less affected by the dnc's, you know ban or not ban [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4732.76s)]
*  It's affected by the kinds of fights that we lead and the way that we fight back against people trying to break the country [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4739.64s)]
*  so I [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4745.0s)]
*  you know being in wisconsin where republicans rigged our campaign finance law to [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4746.6s)]
*  Uh officially to shut out corporate money [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4750.4400000000005s)]
*  But it's actually to shut out union money and then raise money from billionaire owners of giant corporations to to fund their campaigns through dark money [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4752.360000000001s)]
*  And and on the independent side, I think that a dnc ban is actually not an effective tool to to winning the kinds of fights [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4759.64s)]
*  We need to win to be able to change our campaign finance laws nationally [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4766.120000000001s)]
*  I asked one of your opponents ken martin the same question too, and he gave me a similar answer and also [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4769.08s)]
*  Was saying that you know, there's some [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4774.92s)]
*  People that would be classified as corporate PACs and lobbyists that are actually, you know [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4777.8s)]
*  People on our side that we'd like not just corporations that we'd like but actual like groups, right like progressive groups [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4781.639999999999s)]
*  Uh unions, right like you just mentioned this too. Yeah, i'm trying to figure out i'm trying to like read read between the lines here [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4788.12s)]
*  Is it that we don't want to unilaterally disarm in the face of republicans raising all this money? [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4794.76s)]
*  Or is it that we there are going to be? [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4799.639999999999s)]
*  Uh places with PACs [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4802.84s)]
*  You know entities with PACs and and lobbying arms that are good progressive causes that we'll want to take money from what's what's going on there? [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4805.16s)]
*  so it's one part not wanting to unilaterally disarm but the amount of like money that corporations give to the [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4813.32s)]
*  Democratic party is actually not meaningful and it's you could you could accept zero and it wouldn't wouldn't change the total amount [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4820.42s)]
*  Okay, the the the big picture is actually lots of the the state level races across the country and local races across the country where [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4826.68s)]
*  You know if you go down to state legislative races in red states a lot of times [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4834.68s)]
*  It's only the the like business community members that are you know, think that the attacks on you know [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4838.68s)]
*  Different communities are totally unacceptable [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4845.080000000001s)]
*  And finally move to defense that actually are the only way that democrats have to be able to do this work and I got it [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4847.080000000001s)]
*  So the the dnc's policy it's just it is it's symbolic and I think when democrats running for office say [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4852.2s)]
*  I'm going to take no corporate PAC contributions that often is a really powerful way to state their values and be able to fight [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4858.92s)]
*  As an institution, it's something that is you know winds up making it difficult in particular circumstances [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4864.44s)]
*  I think that the other the other big picture thing is [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4870.2s)]
*  That we should be very clear about is that democrats should be fighting against [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4874.04s)]
*  Big corporate interests that try to you know build monopolies and rip people off [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4878.5199999999995s)]
*  uh [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4882.36s)]
*  and in favor of bringing down costs for people and you know making economies sustainable and supporting unions in a way that is [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4883.24s)]
*  Crystal clear and so for example, I have said we will not accept any money from a company that's actively engaged in union busting [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4889.639999999999s)]
*  and being able to [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4895.96s)]
*  Return a contribution from a company that has uh is involved in union busting is a way to make a powerful statement in that moment [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4897.72s)]
*  in a way that uh, you know not having a [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4904.04s)]
*  the the overall policy makes possible [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4906.76s)]
*  I [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4909.88s)]
*  The fundamental thing I think in in our politics at this moment is what fights we choose and that goes to my theory of attention [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4912.36s)]
*  It also goes to my theory of you know [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4917.8s)]
*  How we rally a coalition that that represents our values and it you know [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4919.48s)]
*  Ultimately, you're going to piss people off will invest on the other side and come at you and that's fine [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4923.32s)]
*  You have to have to be ready to incur those kinds of fights [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4927.4s)]
*  um, but it's the the fights are actually at the center of this work and my my campaign slogan is unite fight win, which is [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4930.12s)]
*  Uh reflects that idea that you you unite around big fights that demonstrate your values that you're for [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4936.44s)]
*  Working people across race and ethnicity and and in rural areas and suburb and cities the big [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4941.8s)]
*  The big we in this country against the people who are trying to rig the system to rip everybody off [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4947.08s)]
*  And if you can do that, you can actually build trust and build a grassroots fundraising infrastructure [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4951.639999999999s)]
*  Like we built in wisconsin that can sustain the work [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4957.08s)]
*  Uh speaking to ken martin, uh, your your main competitor. Uh, we had him on the show [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4959.96s)]
*  Uh, and I said this to him too. I said, you know, it's I I hadn't didn't really know you from before this [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4965.32s)]
*  You and ben have you know, i'm friends with ben goes goes way back, but you guys have similar vibes. I like that [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4970.5199999999995s)]
*  What's something you guys disagree about? How are your visions different? [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4976.679999999999s)]
*  So our our visions and what we're talking about the campaign trail. There's not a huge amount of daylight [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4979.8s)]
*  I think the big difference is in our record [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4984.5199999999995s)]
*  and I have been working for the last six years in [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4986.76s)]
*  one of maybe the most hotly contested state in the country where republicans throw a wall of money every dirty trick they can a [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4990.92s)]
*  Massive owned media infrastructure to propagandize people that just the most uh blistering and incendiary dark money attacks against our candidates [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=4997.0s)]
*  And it's also a state that's been rigged by the gop for permanent control and in order to unrig our state in order to over time [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5005.08s)]
*  to to beat a 60-year curse with a dem where democrats always lose the governor's race when there's a [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5012.76s)]
*  democratic president governor evers not only [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5017.8s)]
*  Beat that and won reelection. He also expanded his vote share unlike in you know, all of our neighboring states [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5020.68s)]
*  uh in order to in order to [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5026.919999999999s)]
*  Defeat the republican attempt to get super majorities in our state legislature and then flip our state supreme court majority and then [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5029.08s)]
*  Defeat an impeachment attempt and then finally get fair maps and flip 14 state legislative seats [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5034.839999999999s)]
*  Uh, well, you know in minnesota [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5039.879999999999s)]
*  We lost the state legislative seat in this cycle and now the legislature is in chaos in order to do all that [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5041.16s)]
*  We've had to build something that is just bigger and stronger and deeper both in organizing and communication powered by more fundraising [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5045.719999999999s)]
*  Than we've had in any state party in the country and you are our size of our staff [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5052.759999999999s)]
*  Is sometimes similar to that of the dnc like we've had more than 400 staff in the final stretch in both [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5058.2s)]
*  Uh 2020 and 2024 which you know the dnc in those moments is a lot bigger [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5063.32s)]
*  But we've we've i've been leading organizations that have [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5068.759999999999s)]
*  Like deep multi-layered departments doing a huge array of work in partnership with unions and our allies [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5072.36s)]
*  And the front lines of the fight and the minnesota is [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5078.44s)]
*  You know republicans fight there, but it's more of a blue state [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5082.44s)]
*  It's the only state that's been blue since the 1970s in the country and democrats have won every statewide election [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5084.92s)]
*  They were going back to 2006 before uh, you know before my fellow candidate was chair [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5090.36s)]
*  and [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5095.24s)]
*  It's a different kind of fight that's that I think in wisconsin [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5096.12s)]
*  We've we've built something that is a bigger a closer model an approximation of what I think we need to build across the country [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5099.08s)]
*  and [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5105.72s)]
*  My, you know, I appreciate uh, ken martin has has been leading the state chairs association and he's he's fought [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5106.6s)]
*  Within the dnc for state chairs relative to other parts of the dnc [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5113.0s)]
*  But hasn't made the case to the public for why we need to go and build a party apparatus that has this kind of strength [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5116.360000000001s)]
*  And so there hasn't been more public support and fundraising and volunteering and energy for for building [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5122.200000000001s)]
*  The idea of what the democratic party should be about and I feel like i've been able to do that [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5128.120000000001s)]
*  Even for my one state in a way that that I think we need to do for the national party going forward [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5132.04s)]
*  And the last piece on the record is that when I was at move on I was working in partnership with [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5136.6s)]
*  You know with democrats in congress in the house in the senate with with allies in grassroots groups all across the country [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5141.64s)]
*  Uh on you know on progressive media and going on conservative media and non-political media to [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5147.8s)]
*  To change the conversation about a major national crisis where trump was trying [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5152.68s)]
*  To rip away protections that everyone in this country relied on and we won [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5156.4400000000005s)]
*  And we're going to have fights like that going forward and I think having a dnc chair [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5160.120000000001s)]
*  Who has the the both experience and track record and just orientation around that kind of giant battle [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5164.04s)]
*  Is going to be something that we could benefit from as a national party and I I think I bring that uniquely in this race [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5169.8s)]
*  So that's that's my contrast is that kind of fight last question. I'll let you go. Um, I don't know if you noticed but uh, [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5175.240000000001s)]
*  The vibes among democrats not great right now a lot of anger despair fatalism [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5181.8s)]
*  I've also noticed some like weird happy talk from a lot of democratic politicians [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5187.4800000000005s)]
*  It sounds like we just lost a normal election with normal stakes [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5190.92s)]
*  You just mentioned you've been in a you've been a party chair in a state where for a while it seemed like [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5194.92s)]
*  extreme gerrymandering would [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5200.360000000001s)]
*  Lead to functionally the end of democracy in wisconsin [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5202.6s)]
*  um any lessons from that and how to [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5206.2s)]
*  inspire people to move from [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5209.06s)]
*  despair to action [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5212.1s)]
*  Which is seems like what we need right now [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5214.4400000000005s)]
*  In wisconsin, we've been skating along the edge of a cliff [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5217.08s)]
*  And sometimes we've been pushed off that cliff and grabbed the branch as we fell by our our hands and pulled ourselves up by our fingernails [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5219.96s)]
*  To avoid becoming permanently rigged permanently red even though most people do not want what republicans are trying to do [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5225.96s)]
*  And we're facing that exact crisis as a country right now [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5231.879999999999s)]
*  There's a there's a real risk that trump will smash to pieces things that that that families and and [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5234.839999999999s)]
*  You know working people and the poor and people across this country [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5241.799999999999s)]
*  Urgently need and rely on that they did not vote to get smashed that they voted for for chains [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5244.92s)]
*  They voted out of frustration. They voted for all kinds of reasons [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5249.48s)]
*  uh, but what they didn't do is vote to have the the rug pulled out from underneath them and they didn't vote to [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5252.599999999999s)]
*  To end democracy and to have a country that gets rigged by the people at the very top for their benefit at the expense of everyone else [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5258.12s)]
*  And when you're in that kind of darkness [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5264.28s)]
*  tracing the path [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5267.0s)]
*  out of it being able to see the [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5268.36s)]
*  The the glimmer of light at the end of that tunnel and knowing that if you do everything you can everything in your power to take [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5270.36s)]
*  Step after step after step that there's a way out [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5275.5599999999995s)]
*  to me is is the essential thing that you have to do you have to have a north star to be able to to [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5278.44s)]
*  to continue that fight and [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5283.08s)]
*  my [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5285.639999999999s)]
*  The core of what I want to do at the at the dnc is [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5286.679999999999s)]
*  In every state to to draw what that path looks like to communicate it out to our to our activists to our volunteers to our party [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5289.639999999999s)]
*  Members to the candidates and campaigns to have a huge shared product of getting out of this darkness [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5295.48s)]
*  And building a country that works for everyone where where we show that democracy can actually deliver on its promise [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5300.679999999999s)]
*  To deliver a country that that lifts everybody up [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5306.44s)]
*  We have to we have to see that plan [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5309.48s)]
*  We have to be able to touch and feel it and then everyone needs to feel the experience of being part of that fight [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5311.24s)]
*  This can't be something where we're cheering on some politicians somewhere else for giving a great speech [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5316.5199999999995s)]
*  We all need to see ourselves in our own role and that collective action that that being part of something bigger than yourself [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5320.28s)]
*  It is what? [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5326.12s)]
*  Sustains hope and can even allow moments of joy and and relief and even when you fall just short [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5327.08s)]
*  If you know that there's going to be a next step in that chapter in that story that we build together [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5332.84s)]
*  That is how you get through and that's that's that's not a set of feelings people associate with the democratic party necessarily [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5337.08s)]
*  but I think that it has to be in this moment and i'm [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5344.28s)]
*  I'm running for chair and if you're a dnc member who's listening to this podcast right now [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5347.8s)]
*  I'm asking for your vote for chair because I think that's what we can build together [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5351.88s)]
*  And I think the country needs it and I think the stakes are real [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5355.24s)]
*  But I think that the path is there even if it can be so dark that it's hard to discern [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5357.88s)]
*  And if we take these steps, I think that we can make this the low point in an era [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5362.36s)]
*  That that is looked back on as the birth of a new era of progress in this country ben wickler [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5366.92s)]
*  I started by saying that uh as a democrat i'm excited [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5371.32s)]
*  Uh and grateful that you're running. I was a little more nervous as your friend [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5375.16s)]
*  But you know what you seem like you're really into this and now as as a friend [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5IvddYlnKg&t=5378.44s)]
