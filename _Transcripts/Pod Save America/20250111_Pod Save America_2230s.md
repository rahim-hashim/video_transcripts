Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# BREAKING: Gavin Newsom on California's Response to the LA Fires and Trump's Criticism
**Pod Save America:** [January 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw)
*  It's delusional and it's a consistent mantra from Trump going back years and years and years [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=0.0s)]
*  and it's reinforced over and over and over within the right wing. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Jon Favreau. We are driving back from the Emergency Response [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=11.44s)]
*  Command Center in Malibu where I just sat down with Governor Gavin Newsom to talk about the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=17.52s)]
*  LA fires. The governor's team reached out to us earlier this afternoon on Friday and said that [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=23.52s)]
*  the governor wanted to answer some questions and that he would have a couple of announcements. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=30.16s)]
*  He invited Donald Trump to come to California to witness the devastation and called him out in the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=34.16s)]
*  invitation for spreading disinformation from the sidelines. So we talked about that. The governor [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  also announced an investigation into the water shortage that hampered the efforts to put out the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=46.8s)]
*  fires in the palisades on Tuesday night and so we talked about that. We also talked about the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=54.64s)]
*  recovery effort. We talked about the rebuilding effort that's to come and we talked about people's [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  frustrations and hopes who are dealing with the devastation from these fires. Here's my [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  interview with Gavin Newsom. Governor Newsom, welcome back to Pod Save America. Good to be [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=73.68s)]
*  with you under difficult circumstances. Very. We are recording this Friday afternoon at the Command [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=78.08000000000001s)]
*  Center in Malibu. Just before we started recording, you invited Donald Trump to come here to Los [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=83.68s)]
*  Angeles to see the devastation. You said the hundreds of thousands of Americans displaced [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  from their homes and fearful for the future deserve to see us all working together in their best [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  interests, not politicizing a human tragedy and spreading disinformation from the sidelines. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=99.04s)]
*  So this is after Trump blamed you for the fires. He says it's the fault of water mismanagement. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=104.72s)]
*  Your initial response to that was I have a lot of thoughts and I know what I want to say. I won't. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  It seems like you're trying to walk a very fine line here, extending an open hand to Trump as you [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=116.4s)]
*  signed your letter, but also calling him out for spreading disinformation. Is that because you [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=122.72s)]
*  have concerns that he might withhold disaster assistance when he becomes president? He's been [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=128.8s)]
*  pretty straightforward about that. He's tried to do it in the past. He's not just done it here in [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=133.60000000000002s)]
*  California. He's done it in states all across the country. I mean, he did it in Puerto Rico. He did [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=136.88000000000002s)]
*  it even in Utah. He did it in Connecticut and other states. Georgia, he got upset and withheld [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=142.56s)]
*  the emergency dollars in 2018. Even before I was governor of California, he tried to withhold money [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  down in Orange County until apparently a staff member, and this has been well reported, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=153.84s)]
*  staff member said there were a lot of Trump supporters and he decided to change his mind. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=157.52s)]
*  So the rhetoric is very familiar and it's increasingly acute and obviously we all have [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=162.24s)]
*  reason to be concerned about it. What's the disinformation you were referring to in the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  letter and what is the correct information? Well, I mean, look, what the president-elect was saying [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=175.76000000000002s)]
*  about State Water Project and the Delta smelt somehow being culpable of, you know, somehow [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=182.8s)]
*  leading to some of the challenges that we face down here was, it's words. It's a salad. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=192.0s)]
*  It's the form and substance of fog. It's made up. It's delusional and it's a consistent mantra [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=201.12s)]
*  from Trump going back years and years and years and it's reinforced over and over and over [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=208.48s)]
*  within the right wing and so it's become gospel and it's so profoundly ignorant [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=214.95999999999998s)]
*  and yet he absolutely believes it. It's not an ignorance on his part. It's such, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  it's sort of an indelible misinformation that he sort of manifested a falsehood and he decided [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=225.2s)]
*  to bring it into this crisis in a profoundly demeaning and damaging way. I say demeaning to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=232.0s)]
*  the facts, demeaning to the people that were suffering and struggling, to the kids literally [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  were watching their schools burn down. I was just talking to a staff member, a good friend whose [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=245.92s)]
*  house was burned down and his four-year-old as they're driving away said, daddy, did you get my [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=253.27999999999997s)]
*  bunny? And you know, I got four kids. No empathy, no compassion, no capacity to even to understand. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=258.64s)]
*  Just a guy wants to be understood and yeah, that's hard because a lot of people were misled [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=270.56s)]
*  and it's I think led to a lot of finger pointing and consternation at a time when we're quite [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=277.76s)]
*  literally and I say literally because second before I was here, I just got the latest briefing, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=283.2s)]
*  we're bringing cadaver dogs out there in some parts of the fire where people are still [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=288.16s)]
*  potentially missing and we've already lost 11 lives. Yeah, people are just are devastated [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=292.48s)]
*  in Los Angeles. They're scared. They are angry. Some of that is directed at local officials, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=298.96000000000004s)]
*  state officials, you. Of course. We talk about how some of that anger is based on, you know, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=305.44000000000005s)]
*  inaccurate information from Donald Trump and others, but from your perspective, is there anything the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  state of California could have done to be better prepared for a fire like this? And is there [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=315.68s)]
*  anything the state could have done better or faster in responding? Well, you always have to [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=320.0s)]
*  have some humility and grace as it relates to that question and I'm very self-critical in that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=325.76000000000005s)]
*  respect and so we in every incident do an after action report and we will take a sober reflective [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=331.20000000000005s)]
*  look at that, but let's just look at the facts. Just in the last few years, I've been governor, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=339.44s)]
*  we've close to doubled the investments in Cal Fire, the state firefighting force, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=343.84s)]
*  close to double the number of personnel. We've increased the size of our aerial fleet by 16 new [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=352.0s)]
*  helicopters. We were finally able to get from the Pentagon seven C-130s. We got the first one up [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=358.15999999999997s)]
*  there. You saw it up there in the Cal Fire flag on this fire. We had pre-positioned Saturday, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=364.4s)]
*  our state office of emergency service. We all got together before this event, days before the event, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=369.92s)]
*  and we agreed to pre-position in six counties here in Southern California. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=375.52000000000004s)]
*  Hundreds and hundreds of assets. Let me be specific about that. On Sunday, we had 110 engines, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=380.16s)]
*  hundreds of personnel, specialty crews, dozers, water tenders, helicopters. We pre-positioned them [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=388.24s)]
*  strategically in multiple counties and because we had pre-positioned them, they were first on the [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=396.32s)]
*  scene. Many of these people supplementing the resources of this local fire department dealing [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=402.32s)]
*  with overwhelming winds in this overwhelming fire that I happen to be present at within its first [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=408.64s)]
*  few hours and saw firsthand the hurricane winds and the embers going as far as two miles. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=416.24s)]
*  That was overwhelming for the thousands of people that were down there fighting them concurrent, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=422.15999999999997s)]
*  not just here in the Palisades with the fire out there at Eaton and some other fires. Five current [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=428.23999999999995s)]
*  active fires as we're dealing with today. 12,000 personnel currently working, 175 engines that have [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=434.88s)]
*  come from five different states. We have people from around the world offering resources, notably [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=440.47999999999996s)]
*  from Canada and Mexico. We're putting everything we have at it. You just sent a letter telling [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=447.2s)]
*  LA and LA County officials that you're directing the state to investigate the causes of lost water [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=454.24s)]
*  supply and water pressure during the fires. I believe there was also a large reservoir in [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=459.68s)]
*  Pacific Palisades, the San Ynez reservoir that was closed for repairs during the fire. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=463.92s)]
*  Local officials have said the demand for water was just too great to maintain the pressure in [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=470.08s)]
*  the hydrants, especially since aerial water support wasn't available immediately due to the [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=474.32s)]
*  high winds. Do you not believe that explanation? No, it may be the absolute explanation, but there's [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=478.64s)]
*  so much mistrust and finger pointing. Let's just get the facts and let's get them out quickly. Let's [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=483.68s)]
*  stop the finger pointing. Let's just assess the truth. I'm not interested in who's to blame. I [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=488.0s)]
*  want to know what happened. It's a perfectly plausible analysis on the basis of personal [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=493.03999999999996s)]
*  experience with some of the biggest fires in U.S. history. The Tubbs fire, what happened at the Camp [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=499.12s)]
*  Fire, what happened in Maui, that you get systems that are completely tapped out and overwhelmed. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=504.16s)]
*  They weren't designed for these level of fires. And so that explanation is the one that's sort of [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=509.44s)]
*  almost, I won't say universally, but I bet if you talk to nine out of 10 of the folks that are out [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=513.84s)]
*  here at the command, they would subscribe to that point of view. Others are saying, no, it was the [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=518.72s)]
*  pump that went down. It's the pipes. It was the electricity. So let's just get the facts. It's [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=522.8000000000001s)]
*  DWP that ran this system. And we want to make sure this never happens again. Do we need more [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=529.0400000000001s)]
*  redundancy? Do we need a hard? I remember I was mayor of San Francisco. We did a bond to significantly [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=536.24s)]
*  upgrade our infrastructure because we're concerned about a catastrophic earthquake and how that can [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=541.52s)]
*  overwhelm our pumping and fire suppression system. So we want to determine all those facts, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=546.48s)]
*  not on the basis again of finger pointing and assigning blame, but accountability. And we want [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=552.0s)]
*  transparency. One of my best friends just lost his house in the Palisades. He just moved in a [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=558.16s)]
*  couple of months ago, was able to get his two kids and his dogs. And that was it. Lost everything [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=563.76s)]
*  else. He texted me the investigation announcement and said, what's going on here? Is he just trying [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=569.6s)]
*  to pass the blame? And just to your point about the finger pointing and the blame, so many people [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=574.8s)]
*  are so angry. And, you know, how do you, how do you see that in a moment like this, when you're [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=580.16s)]
*  trying to figure out, A, there's a, you know, governor of the largest state in the country and [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=587.04s)]
*  what happens in LA isn't always going to come across your desk, but also the ultimate, you know, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=591.92s)]
*  you're ultimately responsible as the governor of the state. Yeah, of course. I want to know the [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=596.64s)]
*  answers. So I'm the governor of California. I want to know the answer. I've got that question. I can't [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=603.8399999999999s)]
*  tell you about how many people, what happened on my own team saying what happened? And I want to [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=608.0s)]
*  get the answers. And I'll be candid when they want to get straight answers. Yeah. I watched the press [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=612.3199999999999s)]
*  conference. I met with some of those leaders. We had my team start talking to local leaders saying [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=616.32s)]
*  what's going on. And you weren't getting straight answers from the local leaders. I was getting [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=620.96s)]
*  different answers. And so for me, that's not a story. When you start getting different answers, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=623.6800000000001s)]
*  then I'm not getting the actual story. And they're assessing it. And I get that as well. You have a [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=628.88s)]
*  little bit of grace back to the point. We're in this emergency environment and everything else. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=633.0400000000001s)]
*  I just want to determine the facts, but no one has any patience anymore. In this weaponized back to [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=636.6400000000001s)]
*  the agreements of Trump, everyone else, people, there's immediacy and lies travel the proverbial [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=641.68s)]
*  world. And it's hard to get the facts out there unless you have the backing of those facts and [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=646.7199999999999s)]
*  you can communicate them soberly. And so that's what we're trying to achieve as relates to this. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=652.88s)]
*  But I'm doing, but I have 10 other things we're doing concurrently as well. I mean, across the [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=656.4s)]
*  board on recovery, disaster assistance, getting the major disaster declaration, and maybe the [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=660.7199999999999s)]
*  first one in US history over a text with the White House within literally 36 hours to get [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=665.44s)]
*  a hundred percent reimbursement for folks out here. We've been working concurrently in all of [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=672.0s)]
*  these areas. We're doing executive orders as I speak, as it relates to recovery and land use, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=675.7600000000001s)]
*  dealing with speculation and fraud and trying to address issues of the Coastal Commission here [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=681.6s)]
*  and address the issue of planning permits and how we address all of the myriad of needs for [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=686.6400000000001s)]
*  small businesses, all of this in real time. Again, as the state, even though this is not a [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=691.36s)]
*  state responsibility, are to support the city and the county that are overwhelmed at this moment. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=696.64s)]
*  As you were talking about sort of misinformation on how fast it travels, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=703.36s)]
*  one thing I was saying on the show yesterday is I feel like in this age, politicians, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=706.48s)]
*  elected officials need to almost over communicate, communicate as much as possible. You've done that [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=712.8000000000001s)]
*  throughout your tenure. Do you think that Mayor Bass should have canceled her trip to Ghana when [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=718.0s)]
*  she knew that they were going to be an extreme weather event? I literally can't judge it. I don't [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=724.16s)]
*  know when she left. I can't assess that. It's not on it. And I mean this like, at peril, my response [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=727.76s)]
*  appears to be political because I literally do not know when she left. I know when she came back. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=736.56s)]
*  I know that when I was on the scene a few hours after the original 10 acres was announced that [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=745.12s)]
*  her team was on the phone and we were coordinating and we were hand in glove in that respect. And I [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=751.68s)]
*  was grateful for that. And I felt confident in the command response and the team that was assembled [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=756.4s)]
*  at the site. That said, I was not confident on the basis of the hurricane winds that we were [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=763.28s)]
*  experiencing, that we were going to be successful in saving a lot of those homes for one reason, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=769.52s)]
*  that the firefighters were coming down saying, our focus right now is creating safety corridors. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=776.4s)]
*  Our focus right now is saving lives and making sure people get out. Then we focus on property and [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=781.6s)]
*  then we'll get to perimeter because of the acuity, the extreme unprecedented hurricane force winds [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=787.68s)]
*  and how they were swirling in every conceivable direction. This is not a big deal at all, but we [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=794.48s)]
*  went up to one of the canyons on the fire sitting there feeling we're a good quarter mile away. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=800.88s)]
*  I'm not making this up. Video to bear it out. All of a sudden we see an ember hits the tree. Tree [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=807.1999999999999s)]
*  goes on fire. Hundred seconds. God is my witness. May have been 90 seconds. The house is in flames. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=812.64s)]
*  I have embers of flames. They're taking it off my hair and we're running back into the car. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=818.0799999999999s)]
*  Winds are swirling around. Garbage cans were in the air and we were getting the hell out of there. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=822.56s)]
*  That's how quick and we were with experts. We were the leaders with the force who said, we're good. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=827.3599999999999s)]
*  We just want to take you close, keep you safe. All of a sudden they all said, never experience anything [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=832.8s)]
*  in January. I don't want to remind people that drought. Everybody, how dare you bring up drought? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=838.56s)]
*  Well, it's real, but plenty of water down here. All the reservoirs more than full, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=846.0799999999999s)]
*  though this one reservoir, this local reservoir, that's part of the inquiry. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=852.16s)]
*  That was something that wasn't communicated originally. That was one of the reasons to answer [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=855.84s)]

*  I used to. I used to bounce back a lot. You were great at bouncing back. I was great. And you know what? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=875.6800000000001s)]

*  you drink alcohol gets converted into a toxic byproduct in the gut. It's this byproduct, not [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=902.08s)]

*  emergency alerts, evacuation alerts that are wrong. And most people in LA now have downloaded this [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1164.48s)]
*  this watch duty app which is sort of up to the minute evacuation orders and people are relying [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1171.84s)]

*  some small, some you read about, some you never know about, some you experience, something someone [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1199.8400000000001s)]

*  and there were a lot of good lessons learned from that. Of course we had a fire we we had fires in [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1213.04s)]
*  November down here, fires in December, went so far the Franklin scar that actually was we were able [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1217.6000000000001s)]
*  to hold the line. That's around the Franklin star right there that was because it was burned [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1223.3600000000001s)]
*  just recently in December. So all those things are analyzed but let me say this on the technology. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1227.04s)]
*  We have people all around the world coming to California because we're leaders in technology, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1231.28s)]
*  on artificial intelligence. We did a procurement sprint called RFI 2 where we're literally doing [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1236.4s)]

*  cameras, thousand plus AI alert cameras that are calling before 911. Someone calls 911 to get to [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1262.0s)]
*  early suppression. As I say double traditional workforce as relates to boots on the ground. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1268.32s)]
*  We have 2000 more firefighters that are in the budget for the next few years. We put out a forest [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1273.68s)]
*  management plan with 99 specific actions to address vegetation management, forest management, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1278.56s)]
*  four billion dollars to back that up. 2.5 billion that's been spent, 1.5 billion that's in this [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1285.12s)]
*  year's new budget and on that 100% I'm not making this up. We had a big press conference a few months [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1289.92s)]
*  ago on this. 100% of those 99 actions are either adopted or are being adopted. We waived CEQA and [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1295.6s)]
*  environmental rules as it relates to getting defensible spaces. We've tried to move heaven [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1303.68s)]
*  and earth as it relates to forest fire, forest management, vegetation management, etc. To support [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1307.76s)]
*  locals and to address the anxiety people have. We had the National Guard doing hand crew work [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1312.96s)]
*  here on day one. We call them the rattlesnake teams. I got 855 National Guard as we speak [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1319.04s)]
*  working not just the lines on the fire but also offline doing traffic management and supporting [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1325.6000000000001s)]
*  and supplementing a lot of the police force. But again technology is a big part of this. We're not [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1330.8s)]
*  just running the old fire strategies. We're leaders in adaptation and adoption and a lot of that [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1335.52s)]
*  at scale at the state level not fully implemented to your point at the local level but that's [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1343.28s)]
*  starting to change and we're seeing a lot of the private sector not just the public sector begin [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1350.32s)]
*  to advance some partnerships that maintain a state-of-the-art mindset. I want to ask about [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1356.16s)]
*  the rebuilding effort. The legislature just began a special session on Thursday to prepare [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1361.28s)]
*  the state for legal battles with the incoming Trump administration. Have you thought about [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1365.84s)]
*  calling a special session focused on recovery and rebuilding? Yeah I was just talking to both [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1369.6s)]
*  legislative leaders today. We were text exchanging because we were at Lousy Cell Service up there [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1373.92s)]
*  and we're going to get together on whether we need to do that. I'm already working on the [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1379.04s)]
*  executive orders. We're looking to codify some of the executive orders through legislative action. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1383.28s)]
*  Do we need a special session to do that or we can do it in a regular session? I'm open to either. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1388.16s)]
*  Happy to do whatever moves the needle forward. We already have tracks on insurance in the state's [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1393.0400000000002s)]
*  fair plan. Reinsurance, I got a track on utilities, what this means to the utility sector more broadly. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1398.0s)]
*  Obviously we're investigating responsibility, culpability. Is it arson? Is it a public power [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1404.72s)]
*  agency? Is it a private power agency? All those things are being determined in real time. We're [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1410.24s)]
*  working on a recovery procedure as it relates to atmospheric river comes here in the next few [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1414.88s)]
*  weeks. Floods and mitigations as it relates to hazardous waste, traffic management. All teams [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1419.2800000000002s)]
*  are running these parallel tracks in real time as again we're trying to suppress these five fires. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1425.6000000000001s)]
*  Palisades alone has something like six billion of insurance exposure under fair California's [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1430.8000000000002s)]
*  insurance program. Not nearly enough to rebuild those homes. Should the state step in and help [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1435.3600000000001s)]
*  finance the rebuilding of these homes or do the homeowners have to do it themselves? [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1440.3200000000002s)]
*  There was an estimate of 5.9 billion which I think you're referring to. These are back of [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1445.5200000000002s)]
*  the envelope estimates. Wall Street Journal did some 57 billion. I mean people haven't even been [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1448.64s)]
*  in. I just got an area that no one, trust me, had been in. I don't know how the hell you've assessed [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1453.2800000000002s)]
*  all the damage. It's some aerial assessments and there's damage happening in real time. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1458.3200000000002s)]
*  But they're catastrophic. The number of buildings still estimated. It's well north of 10,000, 12,000, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1462.5600000000002s)]
*  15,000. I mean it changes by the hour. Structures and what's the structures? Is it a full home [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1468.5600000000002s)]
*  or is it an ADU? What is exactly? All that's going to be stress test. Here's the concern. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1473.6s)]
*  You've got a market, insurance market all across the country, not even unique to California, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1478.9599999999998s)]
*  that has been stretched and impacted by climate change. Let's just be candid. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1483.6s)]
*  And the inability in some states like California to do climate modeling [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1487.76s)]
*  as it relates to rate structures as well. We made reforms in the last year to include [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1491.84s)]
*  climate modeling. We made some reforms ironically that just last week [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1496.9599999999998s)]
*  led to, and this is not my words, led to, they announced because of the reforms, led to an insurers, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1501.12s)]
*  to a new insurer going into Paradise, California to reinsure people there that have already recovered [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1506.8799999999999s)]
*  and moved back in. So we're finally making progress on that. And obviously this is going to set us [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1512.56s)]
*  back. That said, Fair Plan has a reinsurance plan. It reimburses anywhere from 30 to 90% depending on [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1517.36s)]
*  the size of the claim. There's a socialization as it relates to the Fair Plan. It's not a [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1524.2399999999998s)]
*  state plan. It's not a public plan. It's run through this insurance, this pool of which the [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1531.28s)]
*  current insurers market participate. And so there may be a bleed into the pockets of those. And [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1537.2s)]
*  we'll see the impacts more broadly, the rates across the state. You have a lot of higher end [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1546.08s)]
*  homes that were insured, not by your traditional California insurers, but by international insurers. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1551.52s)]
*  That's also being assessed. All of that is happening in real time. Like I said, we have a [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1557.28s)]
*  whole team just on the insurance market looking at utilities. Remember in Paradise, it led to the [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1561.12s)]
*  bankruptcy of PG&E, the largest public utility or investor owned utility, excuse me, in the United [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1566.08s)]
*  States of America, where we created a new fund under SB 1054, a wildlife fund, which we're also [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1571.76s)]
*  stress testing right now. All of these things again in real time. What's the future look like [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1580.48s)]
*  on insurance though? I mean, thousands of people had their insurance policies canceled even in the [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1585.12s)]
*  weeks before the fire. I know the insurance commissioner came out and said moratorium for a [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1589.52s)]
*  year on any place that's been impacted by the fire. So, you know, policy- [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1593.6s)]
*  Well, this legislation I just signed and I'm glad he exercised it. And he also called for a voluntary [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1598.32s)]
*  extension of that for an additional six months. We want to get into the commercial sector as well. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1602.4799999999998s)]
*  So that was timely that we at least were able to do that. So anyone that did lose their home, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1606.9599999999998s)]
*  they cannot cancel your insurance, legally cannot cancel your insurance for a minimum of a year. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1611.84s)]
*  But again, we'd love to see that extended and we may need to look at legislation. Again, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1615.84s)]
*  trying to find the balance between market pressures, realities and costs, meaning the [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1619.9199999999998s)]
*  burden on the monthly plans. So the people were pulling back senior across the country, rates here. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1624.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's ironic California has, and trust me, I'm on the receiving. I lost one of our homes, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1633.1999999999998s)]
*  which is in the WUE. We're on the fair plan because we lost private insurance. We pay more [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1638.08s)]
*  than the mortgage on the property just for insurance and it's significantly underinsured. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1642.1599999999999s)]
*  WUE is wildland urban interface. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1646.6399999999999s)]
*  You got it. So I intimately understand the challenges of this. That said, the market was [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1648.6399999999999s)]
*  beginning to stabilize again, farmers made an announcement they were moving back in. So all of [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1653.4399999999998s)]
*  this we need to unpack and figure out what it's going to do in the market. But adjustments will [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1658.08s)]
*  need to be made. And again, we'll move quickly since we're back in session, be it a special [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1662.8s)]
*  session or regular session and drive this. Down the road though, how do you make sure [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1667.9199999999998s)]
*  that insurance companies will even insure people in places in California that are vulnerable to [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1673.6s)]
*  fight that will be more vulnerable as climate change worsens? And the executive board I did a [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1679.84s)]
*  year ago where we talked about the prospect of allowing forward thinking climate modeling for [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1682.96s)]
*  the first time to allow for rates to be established. And also working the insurance [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1688.4s)]
*  commissioner led this effort. It requires if you're entering the market and you're going to [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1693.52s)]
*  increase rates a certain percent that you have to insure within these WUE areas. So there's an [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1699.0400000000002s)]
*  actual prescriptive requirement that requires in return for any rate increases, a comparable [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1706.8000000000002s)]
*  commitment to actually insure and not just run out of the market. So again, this is the balance. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1713.44s)]
*  You've seen it all throughout the United States, obviously in the South, the impacts of these [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1719.28s)]
*  hurricanes, place like Florida, the rates are off the charts. California is ironically a little [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1723.44s)]
*  below the national average. No one feels that way. I certainly don't as a rate payer. But this [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1728.16s)]
*  obviously is going to impact all that. Look, it's going to impact, we have tax collection issues, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1734.56s)]
*  property tax issues. We're putting our budget together. Clearly the IRS under major disaster [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1738.32s)]
*  declarations can extend taxes. We'll have to conform with that appropriately in the state [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1744.0s)]
*  of California. So you go into budgeting a little differently with economic. This is a ten-pole [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1748.08s)]
*  economy in the state among the temples. And which in a state that's a ten-pole the US economy, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1752.72s)]
*  the fifth largest economy, $3.86 trillion a year economy, where by the way, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1758.1599999999999s)]
*  the economy is starting to boom again. Our revenues we just announced today of $16.5 billion [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1762.56s)]
*  from what we projected just six months ago that was announced today in terms of the top line. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1768.88s)]
*  And so this comes at an inopportune time. And obviously with the transition and power in [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1774.32s)]
*  Washington, DC. So a lot of challenges. Do people in Los Angeles need to think twice about living in [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1780.48s)]
*  the hills and canyons and people and places that are vulnerable to fires and other climatization? [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1786.4s)]
*  Well, it's the new reality. I mean, we say it all the time, the hots are getting hotter, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1792.72s)]
*  dries are getting drier, wets are getting a lot wetter. These atmospheric rivers, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1796.0s)]
*  just these rain bombs that we're all experiencing. We've changed everything. I mean, I've put out a [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1800.3200000000002s)]
*  new water management plan in the state of California. We fund it with billions and billions [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1808.0800000000002s)]
*  of dollars in investments in infrastructure. In that space, got to change conveyance, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1812.08s)]
*  got to change the way you capture water, not just above ground, but below ground. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1817.4399999999998s)]
*  We got to change some of our environmental rules, which we've been proactive about. And that's [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1822.3999999999999s)]
*  constant challenge. And that's again, what Donald Trump was speaking to specifically. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1827.28s)]
*  We may have more in common than he thinks. We may have a lot less in common in other ways than he [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1832.32s)]
*  thinks on that. More in common in that there are some regulations and environmental rules. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1837.12s)]
*  I mean, the simplicity to which he marks this, it's a deeper dive, though. I think you did a [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1841.92s)]
*  master class on this. I think it was yesterday. Oh, yeah. We learned all about the smell. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1854.24s)]
*  Yeah, no. So I would refer to the previous podcast, which went off to trot on all grounds here. But [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1858.24s)]
*  that's what Trump's doing. And these are golden old. He's going back decades and decades and [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1866.16s)]
*  California. But it's not a binary. I want more flexibility. I'm ready to work with anyone in [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1871.04s)]
*  terms of modernization. Back to the point, not just on infrastructure as it relates to capturing [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1875.36s)]
*  water, but recognizing we have to change the way we design and build our communities, ingress, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1880.1599999999999s)]
*  egress, redundancy systems. Perfect example, what that letter represents to understand what's going [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1886.1599999999999s)]
*  on. By the way, that letter wasn't just for this. It was for every other community. And what's going [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1891.84s)]
*  on? What other similar situated communities are there? I mean, if there's no one denies this, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1896.88s)]
*  there is no fire season. If someone says that, it's become laughable. I just said, I reminded [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1903.68s)]
*  everyone we just had the Franklin fire in December with the mountain fire in November, just down here [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1908.88s)]
*  in Southern California. There hasn't been any meaningful rain since last May. And here we are [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1914.72s)]
*  in January with the prospects the next 10 days. It's dry. It's 72 degrees out here. And so that's [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1919.3600000000001s)]
*  reality. You deal with reality. And so you're going to rebuild. You got to rebuild, as the [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1925.36s)]
*  president said today, better in the context of materials. And we need to reward better [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1929.1999999999998s)]
*  construction with lower rates for insurance. We've got to design our communities with public safety [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1937.36s)]
*  in mind. And that's what we learned in Paradise, which had a PO box to your question of should we [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1944.32s)]
*  move into the wooey that goes back to the gold rush who came first. And so you tell communities [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1950.64s)]
*  that have been around since the beginning of this state being around, you've got to vacate because [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1957.3600000000001s)]
*  now you're too proximate in a world of climate change to the beauty and the majesty of the state. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1963.0400000000002s)]
*  So it's tough. But obviously land use has to radically be rethinking. We have an affordability [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1970.16s)]
*  crisis as it is. How do you make sure that people can rebuild their homes as fast as possible without [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1976.0s)]
*  dealing with the usual red tape bureaucracy? How do you make sure this doesn't lead to California [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1981.12s)]
*  becoming an even more expensive state to live in? Well, we've been hammering, hammering the last six [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1986.8s)]
*  years on reforming housing and reforming our regulatory system. I created a housing accountability [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1991.6s)]
*  unit because I wasn't satisfied. 540 actions, tens of thousands of units we've unlocked, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=1996.64s)]
*  we're suing cities because they're not zoning. They're not building housing fast enough, [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2002.24s)]
*  not even market rate housing, let alone workforce housing and low income housing. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2006.56s)]
*  And so we're going to continue to drive accountability. We, in fact, we strengthen [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2010.32s)]
*  our accountability rules and regulations last year. We're reforming our environmental rules. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2014.48s)]
*  As I said, 42 secret reforms, but specific to your question around this rebuild, the executive orders, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2018.56s)]
*  we run executive orders. I want to work with the legislature, codify those executive orders, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2025.68s)]
*  time value to construction, get the permits, state deal with all of those, create a specific [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2030.16s)]
*  timeline, making it up. We're working on the exact date. So don't hold me to it. 120 days, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2039.04s)]
*  get the permit and do it in a way that we've done it with the experience at hand in other [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2044.0s)]
*  communities that have been severely ravaged by wildfires. I remind you, tubs 5,600 units impact. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2051.2000000000003s)]
*  And we rebuilt, we're rebuilding that community, 18,000 in paradise. So we know how to do this. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2059.04s)]
*  We've done it in the past. We learn, we iterate, but the scale of this is going to require us to [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2065.92s)]
*  be better and do better. And I'm not waiting back to doing everything at once. We are going [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2071.36s)]
*  to be making announcements quite literally in the next few days to specifically answer that question [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2076.72s)]
*  through the executive authority that's vested in me and then get to work with the legislature in [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2082.64s)]
*  this legislative session. Last question. Do you have a message for people who have lost everything [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2086.64s)]
*  in these fires and who are scared and angry and frustrated and concerned that the state's going [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2094.0s)]
*  to forget them or leave them behind or they're not going to be able to rebuild? That's not in our DNA. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2101.68s)]
*  It's just not in our DNA. Look, maybe it's nature nurture five generations. I grew up in San [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2106.96s)]
*  Francisco. The flag of San Francisco is the Phoenix, Phoenix rising. I mean, the San Francisco [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2113.68s)]
*  pre 1906 versus San Francisco today, we built back stronger, better, more vibrant, more dominant in [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2120.16s)]
*  every category, every way, shape, or form our spirit, sense of pride, purpose, mission. And [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2127.7599999999998s)]
*  that's exactly what's going to happen down here. I mean, I told you that campfire, there was no way [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2134.0s)]
*  that was ever going to be repopulating. The fact that kids are back in school, we never turned our [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2141.28s)]
*  back on those folks. We'll never turn our back on the folks down here, not just here on the coast, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2146.4s)]
*  but those folks and that very diverse community near Pasadena and Altadena and those communities [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2151.36s)]
*  have been impacted by the Eden fire. We will be back. We have their back. I was with the FEMA [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2161.36s)]
*  director today. I want that disaster assistance.gov at disaster assistance.gov. Anyone that's been [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2166.16s)]
*  impacted, go to that. We've got this major disaster declaration. I said to the FEMA, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2173.3599999999997s)]
*  no one's going to turn, you're not turning your back in the short run. We want you back. I don't [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2179.2s)]
*  care what the administration is. They still have, by the way, a FEMA office from 1994 related to [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2182.7999999999997s)]
*  impacts here in disasters from 1994. And we're actually expanding that office in Pasadena [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2190.96s)]
*  for being the new FEMA office today. They never left. We're not going to turn our back. We're not [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2197.36s)]
*  leaving. Governor Newsom, thank you. Thanks for joining Pod Save America. Thanks for having me. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2202.48s)]
*  It's a busy day. Thank you. Sorry about everything happening, man. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2206.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdioEFwQZw&t=2220.96s)]
