Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Kamala Harris Takes Fight To Donald Trump In New MSNBC Interview and Trip to Border
**Pod Save America:** [September 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro)
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Jon Favreau. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Dan Pfeiffer. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2.0s)]
*  On today's show, Kamala Harris does a big sit-down interview about her economic plan [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3.0s)]
*  and heads to the border as she tries to neutralize Donald Trump's advantage on two big issues. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=6.8s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump wants you to know that he thinks Iran is trying to kill him and [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=11.84s)]
*  that you can buy a new Trump watch for the low, low price of $100,000. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=16.16s)]
*  And Strict Scrutinies Melissa Murray stops by to talk with us about what she heard from some [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=22.16s)]
*  undecided black women voters in her new MSNBC special. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=25.84s)]
*  But first, Kamala Harris has had another busy week with less than 40 days left [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=30.4s)]
*  in a campaign that could not be closer. She's headed to Arizona to visit the southern border. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=35.2s)]
*  On Thursday, she spent the day in D.C. being vice president, first at an event with Ukrainian [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=41.04s)]
*  President Vladimir Zelensky, then at an event with President Biden to announce some new steps on gun [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=45.44s)]
*  safety. On Wednesday night, she sat down for an interview with MSNBC's Stephanie Rule to talk about [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=50.56s)]
*  the economic plan she laid out during a big speech in Pittsburgh. Here she is talking about [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=56.88s)]
*  price gouging and responding to Trump's claim that she didn't really work at McDonald's. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  How do you go after price gouging without implementing price control? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=69.2s)]
*  Just to be very frank, I am never going to apologize for going after [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=74.0s)]
*  companies and corporations that take advantage of the desperation of the American people. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=81.76s)]
*  And as attorney general, I saw this happen in the midst of an emergency, whether it be an extreme [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=86.24s)]
*  weather event or even the pandemic, we saw it where those few companies, not the majority, not most, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=92.16s)]
*  but those few companies that would take advantage of the desperation of people and jack up prices. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to go after them. Yes, I'm going to go after them. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=105.91999999999999s)]
*  I just want to ask you yes or no. At any point in your life, have you served to all beef patties, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun working out at McDonald's? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=115.19999999999999s)]
*  Yes or no? That's it. I have. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  Okay. Now the other job. Now the other job. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=122.08s)]
*  But it was not a small job. I do the fries. I mean, I, you know, yes, but I did. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=124.08s)]
*  Okay, for a small period of time. But then let me ask about a big job. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=128.48s)]
*  But to your point, if you don't mind, before you get to the big job, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=130.64s)]
*  it's a, there's a, part of the reason I even talk about having worked at McDonald's is because [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=134.72s)]
*  there are people who work at McDonald's in our country who are trying to raise a family. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=141.92s)]
*  I worked there as a student. I was a kid who worked there trying to raise families and pay rent on that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=146.64s)]
*  And I think part of the difference between me and my opponent includes our perspective on the needs [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=153.52s)]
*  of the American people and what our responsibility then is to meet those needs. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=161.36s)]
*  She did fries. That's, you know, that's a, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=167.36s)]
*  do you know, I'm not to derail this thing, but do you know the origin, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=172.0s)]
*  the conspiracy theory that she didn't work at McDonald's because Trump says it all the time. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=175.44s)]
*  Yes. He, there was a, one of those dumb, blue checked right-wing accounts that [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=178.48s)]
*  pretends to be news said that McDonald's step forward and said that they have no record [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=185.28s)]
*  of Kamala Harris ever working there. And that's just not true. It was just completely made up. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=190.48s)]
*  So he took McDonald, he took the fake rumor or the fake news that McDonald's said that she never [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=194.56s)]
*  worked there to mean that she was lying, but that just never happened. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=201.35999999999999s)]
*  But okay. Also what sort of records do we think McDonald's keeps about [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=205.04000000000002s)]
*  an Oakland franchise from 40 years ago? That's the best part. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  And then they like long ago, they accused her when she first said it, they accused her of like [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=212.88s)]
*  not having it on her resume when she like sent her resume out after law school. Cause like, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=216.56s)]
*  yeah, it's like, you know what? I don't put fucking CVS on my resume. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=222.56s)]
*  Although I don't send a resume around in quite some time. Anyway, how do you think she did in [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=226.32000000000002s)]
*  the interview? Great. That was great. I was so many thoughts on this interview. One, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=232.08s)]
*  not an easy interview. No, I think the thought is MSNBC, it's Stephanie Ruhl, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=237.36s)]
*  that it'll at least be a friendly interview. And it wasn't unfriendly, but those were, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=241.52s)]
*  she asked tough questions. And it was all about the economy. It wasn't, I mean, she, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=244.48000000000002s)]
*  she asked one question on reproductive rights at the very end, but most of the interview was [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=248.16000000000003s)]
*  all economy and economic policy and details and all of that. And it's like, it took her like one [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=253.12s)]
*  question to warm up. And then she was just throwing fastballs the whole time. It's just, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=258.56s)]
*  it's when she asked the question about why people trust Donald Trump more, she got, you could see [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=262.0s)]
*  like a little fire in her eyes. And she went like right hard at the contrast and it was really good. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=265.44s)]
*  And I have two takeaways from this. One is more interviews. Like she's, she's really good at it [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=270.88s)]
*  when it's an issue that she, when it's about something real, right? A bunch of like the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=276.24s)]
*  marginalia, stupid bullshit that comes up in a lot of like horse race stuff and interviews. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=280.48s)]
*  That's hard for any politician when they ask you to be pundit. But when she's talking about [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=284.8s)]
*  something she cares about, she's excellent. Second, I kind of think that if Trump is unwilling [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=287.6s)]
*  to agree to this CNN debate, they should challenge him to an economic debate. It could be on CNN, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=293.6s)]
*  can be another network, but like think about, she just has, he has the advantage and perception, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=298.48s)]
*  but it's like a mile wide and inch deep. And she has the better message, the better policies. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=304.0s)]
*  She's the better messenger. The contrast is it moves vote share. We've seen that in message [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=309.76000000000005s)]
*  testing and polling. And so finding opportunity to go back and forth with Trump only on the, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=314.48s)]
*  like he'll obviously do insane stuff, but primarily on the economy for 90 minutes, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=318.96000000000004s)]
*  I think could be a huge advantage. I was watching this interview. I agree. I thought it was [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=323.12s)]
*  excellent. I thought it was her best sit down interview yet since becoming the nominee. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=329.28000000000003s)]
*  I realized she hasn't done a ton. Everyone's going to say best of four, right? Yeah. But I [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=336.24s)]
*  think it was the best one. And you're right that she always takes a, like the first question to [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=339.84s)]
*  warm up and she always answers the first question by like thinking. And she's like looking, she can [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=344.88s)]
*  tell that she's like trying to figure out what value statement to start with. It's very clear [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=349.52s)]
*  that she has been through debate prep and we know this because we've done this with Obama and he [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=355.28s)]
*  hated this, but they tell you in debate prep, no matter what the question is, your answer should [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=360.79999999999995s)]
*  start with a topic sentence that just communicates your values about the issue. It doesn't matter [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=365.6s)]
*  what the actual question was. Right. And she did that very well during the debate. And I think that [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=371.36s)]
*  for questions that you don't really want to answer or the answer would be too politically tricky or [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=377.76000000000005s)]
*  whatever, it's a good thing to do. I noticed that as we got into the meat of the interview, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=383.6s)]
*  she just sounded, she sounded wonkier and more detailed, but I liked it. It sounded less like [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=390.88000000000005s)]
*  a politician talking in cliches and more like someone who just really knows the policy and [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=396.8s)]
*  knows the issue. And I think it just came across oddly since it was wonkier, but it came across more [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=404.0s)]
*  informal and colloquial and just real, you know, than some of the, like I'm, it's very good that [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=411.36s)]
*  she's talking about her middle-class upbringing, very good that she's talking about how she sees [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=416.96s)]
*  the economy. But I would just like dial it a little, I dial it down just a little bit, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=421.2s)]
*  which she did in this interview and just answer the questions and start talking about the policy. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=426.32s)]
*  Yeah. You almost have to deprogram candidates after debate because what is good for debate is [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=431.52s)]
*  generally terrible for an interview. Cause you're told to not answer the debate question or you're [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=436.48s)]
*  supposed to answer it with the answer you want. Now the question was asked that can work in a [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=440.48s)]
*  press conference. It can't really work in a one-on-one sit down interview. And so that first [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=445.44s)]
*  question was, let me go big picture and do all of this. And then everything else is just like, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=449.12s)]
*  I'm just going to answer the question. And it just comes off more authentic and real. And it was [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=453.52s)]
*  very, very good. And the further she's gotten away from the debate, I realized I just proposed [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=457.12s)]
*  another debate, so I could be screwing us here. But, um, her, in each subsequent interview, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=460.88s)]
*  her questions, her answers have been more on point to the question, which I think is to her benefit. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=466.72s)]
*  Yeah. I think it's always the questions that she typically gets tripped up on are questions about, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=471.68s)]
*  like they're hypotheticals, which are always annoying ones to answer. But like Stephanie [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=479.2s)]
*  Ruhl asked her, like, what's going to happen if, uh, you can't get Republican votes for your tax [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=483.52s)]
*  plan, you know? And then she didn't want to answer that question. But I do think even, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=488.08s)]
*  even on something like that, it's like, well, what I'm going to do is I'm going to propose a tax plan [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=492.08s)]
*  and I'm going to negotiate. And what I hope is also that I have, uh, members of Congress who [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=496.32s)]
*  are going to work with me to lower taxes for middle-class Americans and raise them on the [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=501.76s)]
*  rich. And that's what I'm going to try to do. You know, like it's pretty. Or we're just going to, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=505.04s)]
*  we're going to win the Senate, right? Or we're going to win. Yeah. That's why we're going to win [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=509.2s)]
*  the Senate. Like I just, some of the, I think some of these answers are easier than, um, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=511.92s)]
*  than she's making them out to be, or maybe she thinks that like, she's not supposed to say it. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=516.88s)]
*  Anyway, I thought she was great through like 95% of the interview and like the best she's been on [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=520.8s)]
*  this and she should do more. Um, what'd you think of the big Pittsburgh speech? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=525.6s)]
*  My take away from watching the speech was good speech, poll tested through the roof. Like it [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=529.84s)]
*  had the policy proposals are popular. It wasn't just a litany of a bunch of like economic white [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=535.52s)]
*  paper vomit, uh, on stage. It was like an, it was, it was thematic. It spoke to the broader theme [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=541.76s)]
*  of her as someone with a middle-class background is going to fight for middle working-class people [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=548.08s)]
*  while Donald Trump's going to fight for the wealthy. So that was very good. I do watch these [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=551.76s)]
*  speeches now and so sort of wonder what the impact of these big set set speeches are in this day and [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=555.12s)]
*  age. Um, obviously it's in Pittsburgh. If you're going to do it, do it someplace where you're going [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=562.08s)]
*  to get lots of local coverage. I'm sure we're going to see ads that take, um, parts of that [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=566.96s)]
*  speech and put it together for an economic message. There will be some social media stuff, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=572.4s)]
*  but how many outside of the ads are going to run for it later, or maybe the people watching [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=576.32s)]
*  Pittsburgh TV, how many people who don't know about her economic plans or want to know more [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=580.24s)]
*  about economic plans will actually consume that speech. I think that's sort of a fair question [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=584.24s)]
*  in this day and age. Yeah, I think it's, you know, she hasn't given because she hasn't had the time [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=587.84s)]
*  to give a lot of like major policy addresses. So you want to give your big economic major policy [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=592.96s)]
*  address. So that totally made sense for that. It was a good speech. Um, I would love to see her do [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=597.28s)]
*  a version of that speech, basically cut it down so that it's a punchy stump speech on the economy [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=604.48s)]
*  and have a few more contrasts with Donald Trump, or basically she had a lot of contrasts with [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=610.8s)]
*  Donald Trump, but just kind of whittle the speech down to just her plan contrast with Donald Trump, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=615.76s)]
*  her plan contrast with Donald Trump and, and make it punchy for rally events. Um, because I agree, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=620.8s)]
*  like, I don't know exactly who's going to consume all of that other than the fact that you're right, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=628.0s)]
*  it could end up in some 30 and 62nd ads. Um, but it was, it was, uh, it was a good speech, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=632.64s)]
*  you know? And like you said, it wasn't, it wasn't wonky. Again, there was a few times in that speech [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=638.4s)]
*  where she would, she seemed like she was ad-libbing, she was joking a little. And I really liked those [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=643.4399999999999s)]
*  parts because it seemed, she was more authentic. She seemed like hers. She seemed like she was [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=649.12s)]
*  having a good time. She seemed like she was connected with the material, with the audience, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=653.12s)]
*  with what she was talking about. Like, I think she just needs a little more of that on the trail in [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=657.4399999999999s)]
*  interviews, um, because it's there and you know, I've seen her do it. Um, but I think that's going [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=661.84s)]
*  to help with connecting with voters who are still undecided. Um, there's obviously a lot to say about [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=667.04s)]
*  her economic plan campaign also released an 82 page booklet titled A New Way Forward for the middle [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=673.76s)]
*  class. Um, but for the people who may not have had the chance to skim through that book, uh, what do [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=680.3199999999999s)]
*  you think the campaign wants to convey about her economic agenda? Like what are the big things they [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=686.8s)]
*  want voters to remember? I think they want people to know that she has a plan. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=692.4000000000001s)]
*  Right. This is like a classic tactic for a candidate who's new on the scene. Obama also [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=697.5200000000001s)]
*  released a plan. We had a book in fact, an actual published book. I remember editing the book, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=702.48s)]
*  long book. I remember you enjoying that process thoroughly and thinking what a great use of your [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=707.12s)]
*  time or while either writing or editing three rally speeches a day. Well, I know so many people [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=711.9200000000001s)]
*  read it, you know. I think it was the best seller, John. Yeah, of course. Honestly, anyone can do [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=716.8800000000001s)]
*  that these days as we know. Um, so it's just like having a plan, right? She has a plan. That's one [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=721.28s)]
*  the bit. It is just notable in that speech that she's she announced she's a capitalist. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=728.24s)]
*  Yeah. What she said during the convention speech too. Yes, she did. And I think there is a argument [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=732.72s)]
*  here is that she is a mainstream middle class Democrat who's going to fight for middle class [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=737.68s)]
*  people. Like that is all the policy undergirds that that's what it's all about. They really want [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=741.76s)]
*  the footage of her standing up there saying she's going to fight for middle class people and that [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=747.52s)]
*  she's a capitalist. And it is to push back against the caricature of her that is showing up on all [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=750.0s)]
*  these ads. The Trump and the Trump super backs have a bunch of ads up. They're pretty tough on [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=754.56s)]
*  the economy. They blame her for what people aren't happy about the economy. Unfairly blame her, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=759.84s)]
*  obviously. And they have this audit. They have this video footage of her saying that Bidenomics [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=764.72s)]
*  is working. So they're trying to make her the candidate of the status quo in which you don't [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=770.96s)]
*  like. And they're trying to sort of push back against that in a pretty aggressive way. And [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=773.84s)]
*  that's ultimately the political purpose of the speech. There's a headline in the New York Times [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=779.2s)]
*  that the Harris campaign was understandably and excitedly sending around, which was [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=783.2s)]
*  Harris makes a new tries a new pitch capitalism for the middle class. I was like that. That's [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=790.24s)]
*  that's it right there. That's for the class. Where are we these days? I know it gets them [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=794.6400000000001s)]
*  away from by dynamics, which was clearly not the best branding. But yeah, capitalism for the middle [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=801.2800000000001s)]
*  class. She both gets the like I'm mainstream and not the comrade Kamala. And also like I care about [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=807.2s)]
*  the middle class and what I really liked both in the speech and in the MSNBC interview is that [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=812.96s)]
*  you like when Stephanie Ruhl asked her about price gouging, she was like, I'm going to make and she's [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=819.2s)]
*  like, oh, you know, there's price gouging, but also how do you convince people that it's not price [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=823.76s)]
*  controls because they get nervous? And she's like, I'm not going to make any apologies whatsoever [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=828.72s)]
*  about going after big companies who take advantage of America, the American people. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=832.72s)]
*  And I didn't look at my record when I was a G. I did the same thing I took. I went on after big [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=837.76s)]
*  banks. So it was great. So it's like it wasn't she's not like shying away and trying to be like a [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=842.08s)]
*  mushy centrist on the economy. But she you know, she's basically saying she's a capitalist and [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=847.6s)]
*  capitalism can work, but it doesn't it has to work for everyone in this country, because that's how [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=853.2s)]
*  the economy is strong. And, and big corporations shouldn't be taken advantage and they should pay [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=856.48s)]
*  their first share. Great. I'm sort of curious about the polling that led them to have that line [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=860.8s)]
*  within the convention and here it's not something I've seen show up in any polling that this is a [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=867.12s)]
*  real issue for her. She obviously has an economic deficit. We can talk about how she has narrowed [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=871.52s)]
*  that deficit pretty significantly, significantly narrowed it over where Biden was. But even over [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=875.3599999999999s)]
*  the course of the campaign and the Echelon insights poll, she's actually up one on the economy. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=880.7199999999999s)]
*  And she's only down four on the economy in the Pennsylvania poll that the Times put out last [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=886.64s)]
*  week. So she's made she has made gains there. And I think that's one important thing, like when you [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=891.2s)]
*  sit up and say, I'm a capitalist, that sounds like you're doing from a defensive crouch. And I don't [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=896.96s)]
*  think that's what this speech was not a defensive speech. It was an offensive speech. It was [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=901.12s)]
*  an economic bet. I don't know. I don't know how much the campaign cares whether they actually [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=904.8000000000001s)]
*  win on the economy, but that they can make gains with the voters they need to make gains with on [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=908.5600000000001s)]
*  the economy by being aggressive. And they sort of showed that in the tone and tenor of the speech [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=913.36s)]
*  in the interview. I think there's like two different groups of voters here. There's the [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=918.24s)]
*  sort of center right Indies, maybe Nikki Haley voters that they're trying to go after. Also, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=924.5600000000001s)]
*  some young men to who I think her saying that she's a capitalist and she's no CEOs in his work with [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=931.12s)]
*  them and all that kind of stuff that's going to reassure those voters. And then there's the sort [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=937.92s)]
*  of low propensity, don't always vote younger voters tend to be disproportionately black and brown [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=943.36s)]
*  women to non college women that they're going after, who I think that the more populist middle [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=950.7199999999999s)]
*  class, here's what I'm going to do for you middle class tax cut child tax credit. And some of the [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=957.12s)]
*  homeowner stuff like that. That's who they're targeting with that message. So I think it's [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=963.52s)]
*  probably both those groups with all due respect to our green eye shade wearing economic policy [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=967.52s)]
*  nerd friends. It's all about advocacy. Yeah, everything. It's who are you going to fight for? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=972.88s)]
*  That's the whole thing. It's all these policies, these tax credits, all these things they can [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=977.4399999999999s)]
*  talk about in the campaign are just a way to answer the question. Will this politician fight [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=982.0799999999999s)]
*  for people like me or they fight for corporations or wherever else? And that that's the thrust of [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=986.8s)]
*  and that works. And what is so appealing about that and so important is it works with everyone. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=992.32s)]
*  It works for those Nikki Haley, we're talking about it and it works for younger, younger, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=997.6800000000001s)]
*  younger voters, more progressive voters, everyone else and everyone in the middle. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1002.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. So this week, she gave a serious policy address, stood next to a foreign leader [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1005.0400000000001s)]
*  who's at war, Zelensky at the in Washington, she announced a policy with the president at the [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1011.12s)]
*  White House. She's going to the border. I don't know if all this was intentional or just how the [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1017.68s)]
*  schedule turned out, but do you think they're trying to sort of burnish her strong leader, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1022.16s)]
*  commander in chief credentials with voters with some of these events? [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1028.56s)]
*  I imagine just by the having been involved in the challenges of scheduling presidential candidates [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1032.0s)]
*  who are also in office at the same time, that this was more a quirk in scheduling that just [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1038.72s)]
*  happened to be this was the best time to give this economic speech and Zelensky was going to [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1044.64s)]
*  be in town and he wanted to meet with her. Trump announced this just now that he is meeting with [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1048.16s)]
*  Zelensky tomorrow or today if you're listening to this on Friday. And so I think something you did, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1052.3200000000002s)]
*  I think broadly speaking, they want to do two things. They want to show her that she's a strong [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1057.92s)]
*  presidential leader. Whenever you're trying to elect someone who looks unlike all the other [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1062.96s)]
*  presidents who came before them. Yeah, it's important to put them in situations that seem [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1067.6000000000001s)]
*  familiar. It's why Obama went on that foreign trip in 2008 and met with world leaders so that [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1072.64s)]
*  people can imagine him doing the things that presidents have done. So I think that's part of [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1077.68s)]
*  the Zelensky meeting and going to the border as we talk a little bit about politics of that, but [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1081.8400000000001s)]
*  it's also just she is trying to show that she is a mainstream Democrat with policies and values [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1086.24s)]
*  that are well within the center. I don't mean center like centrist, just that they're not radical, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1093.2800000000002s)]
*  she's being portrayed as this San Francisco radical. She's a black woman, open borders, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1100.64s)]
*  letting people in. She has the burden of being part of the Biden administration, which has [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1105.68s)]
*  been present, which has been in office through these border surges. And this is an opportunity [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1110.64s)]
*  to go to the border and speak about her actual policies and push back against the characters. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1115.68s)]
*  It's all of a piece, but I don't think there were a bunch of post-it notes on the message calendar [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1119.8400000000001s)]
*  with this like three weeks ago and then kind of came together. Yeah, I do think that and we've [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1128.16s)]
*  seen this in some of the ads too, because they have images of her on foreign trips with foreign [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1132.16s)]
*  leaders, walking by all kinds of world flags. I think they are trying to, what you said, show her [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1138.0800000000002s)]
*  doing what presidents do. And she's been vice president for the last three and a half years. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1146.0s)]
*  So that's a helpful job. It should be sufficient. It should be sufficient. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1150.5600000000002s)]
*  But yeah. All right. So she's going to the border. She's reportedly going to give a speech about [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1154.96s)]
*  border security and her record prosecuting cartels and human traffickers as a border state attorney [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1160.0s)]
*  general. So obviously an issue where Trump has a big advantage and he tried to pre-but the visit [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1167.6000000000001s)]
*  with a long and rambling press conference we're going to talk about in a little bit today. But [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1176.16s)]
*  basically the line he's been using for the last week is when she tells you about the border, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1181.76s)]
*  ask her just one simple question. Why didn't you do it four years ago? And he says that's true [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1186.56s)]
*  about every issue. So Harris campaign clearly believes it's important for the VP to take on [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1191.92s)]
*  this issue directly and go right at one of Trump's apparent strengths. There's also an argument to be [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1197.36s)]
*  made that whenever the campaign is about the border and that's where the media focuses, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1203.36s)]
*  it's better for Trump. What do you think? I think this is the right thing to do. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1208.56s)]
*  She's being aggressive. She's willing to take on risk. She understands that for some segment of [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1214.96s)]
*  voters, this is a real question. It's not just far right Fox News watching MAGA voters who care about [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1220.24s)]
*  immigration. It's a huge issue in Arizona and Nevada, two states that are absolutely critical [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1226.56s)]
*  to one of her past 270 electoral votes. And so going there is important because she actually [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1233.12s)]
*  has a good message. Now I hope when she goes there, she mixes it with a message about a broader [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1239.04s)]
*  comprehensive solution to all of our immigration problems. So it's not just border security. It's [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1245.6799999999998s)]
*  also dealing with finding a pathway to citizenship and dealing with people who have been in this [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1248.8s)]
*  country for a long time, dealing with the dreamers and pushing back also on Trump's proposals, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1254.1599999999999s)]
*  his mass deportation proposal and all of that. So it should be of a piece. If it's just border [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1259.68s)]
*  security, then I think you are playing on Trump's territory. If it is going to the border to talk [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1264.0800000000002s)]
*  about border security, what you would do to secure the border and the broader proposals about [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1269.44s)]
*  comprehensive immigration reform. I think that is a very good thing to do. Yeah, I'm a big believer [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1275.28s)]
*  in when a voter has a concern instead of saying, well, I know you might have that concern, but [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1279.68s)]
*  let's talk about this issue instead, where you agree with me. It's like not a good strategy. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1285.44s)]
*  Alex Wagner's show this week, she was in Michigan and she talked to a bunch of union workers. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1289.6000000000001s)]
*  And it was interesting. Some of the older union workers were very pro Harris and the younger ones, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1297.8400000000001s)]
*  especially the younger men, were a little more pro Trump. And a lot of them were talking about [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1305.44s)]
*  immigration as the reason why. And they were saying some of the things you hear directly from [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1311.28s)]
*  Donald Trump and a lot of the right-wing media that there's all these illegal immigrants coming [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1318.48s)]
*  in and it's an invasion and it was much more they're taking our jobs than anything else [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1322.56s)]
*  or driving down wages or making housing more expensive and all that. And I was watching that [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1329.2s)]
*  thinking like she, I'm sure the campaign knows they need to be doing better with men and young [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1335.28s)]
*  men and in the Midwest and like you said, in the border states as well. And I kind of think that [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1341.52s)]
*  you've got to be able to answer the mail on that. And there's a lot of people who haven't even heard [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1349.36s)]
*  Kamala Harris's position on the border, even though she talked about it at the debate, talked about [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1354.16s)]
*  convention speech, talks about it all the time. And if you can have an image of you at the border [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1360.32s)]
*  and delivering a few solid lines and then that ends up in an ad, then I think it's probably useful. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1368.16s)]
*  Soterios Johnson I think you're exactly right about that. And it is just interesting going back to [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1373.44s)]
*  the question about these speeches is back in the day, the speech used to be the end in of itself. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1376.64s)]
*  You'd give the speech, it would get the coverage, it would drive the political conversation. And now [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1381.36s)]
*  it's the initial piece of content that maybe people see, but they probably don't that you then use [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1385.44s)]
*  throughout the rest of the campaign. Like she's going to do this at the border. So I assume there [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1390.24s)]
*  are going to be images you can use that will be in these ads because she's getting hammered with [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1394.32s)]
*  immigration ads in her at the border with the image of the border. Talking about her policy is a much [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1398.96s)]
*  better response ad than your sort of typical voiceover response ads that no one really believes. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1404.72s)]
*  Adam Backman And I'm sure she's going to kick the shit out of Trump there too, right? And talk about [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1409.92s)]
*  how he killed the border deal, which also gets it more attention because then they can get in the [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1413.6s)]
*  back and forth. Speaking of Trump, Trump did his own economic event on Wednesday in North Carolina [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1418.16s)]
*  where standing in front of a giant banner that read jobs, jobs, jobs, he went on a long rant [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1424.16s)]
*  about how he thinks the Iranians are trying to kill him. And he's mad that Joe Biden and Kamala [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1430.8000000000002s)]
*  Harris aren't doing enough to stop them. Here's how it sounded. As you know, there have been [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1435.52s)]
*  two assassination attempts on my life that we know of and they may or may not involve, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1441.12s)]
*  but possibly do Iran. But if I were the president, I would inform the threatening country, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1452.0s)]
*  in this case, Iran, that if you do anything to harm this person, we are going to blow your [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1459.6799999999998s)]
*  largest cities and the country itself to smithereens. We're going to blow it to smithereens. You can't do that. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1465.92s)]
*  Adam Backman It may or may not have to do with, but possibly yes. Yes, I would like to. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1474.72s)]
*  Adam Backman It may or may not have to do with literally anything. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1480.72s)]
*  Adam Backman I am floating a completely unverified rumor that may or may not be true, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1482.8799999999999s)]
*  but you should believe it's true. So the backdrop here is that there's some actual intelligence [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1487.6s)]
*  about Iran fucking with Trump's campaign. I believe right before we started recording, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1494.72s)]
*  the Department of Justice indicted several Iranians in trying to hack the Trump campaign, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1500.4s)]
*  successfully hacking the Trump campaign. The Trump campaign also asked for an intel briefing [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1507.52s)]
*  that they then read out to the press as containing, quote, real and specific threats against Trump's [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1513.6000000000001s)]
*  life. There is, of course, no evidence that no one's seen any evidence, no one's put forward [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1519.44s)]
*  any evidence that either of Trump's would-be assassins has any link to Iran. We also know that [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1525.92s)]
*  Iran has, we have known for some time that Iran has been interested in assassinating former [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1532.8s)]
*  President Trump, as well as various Trump administration officials in retaliation for [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1539.1200000000001s)]
*  the Trump administration killing Soleimani. And so that's true. They also, I think intelligence [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1544.56s)]
*  also says that they were, they've been trying to assassinate current members of the Biden [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1551.44s)]
*  administration. So that's all out there. Why is Trump doing this at a rally? This wasn't even [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1555.84s)]
*  like an ad lib kind of thing where he just went off. It was in the prepared remarks. His team [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1563.12s)]
*  previewed it to the press. What is he doing? [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1568.6399999999999s)]
*  There is a part of his remarks, it was not in that clip, where he talks in some probably not [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1571.6799999999998s)]
*  totally accurate detail about the FBI's inability to access the phones and the foreign messaging [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1578.0s)]
*  apps used by both of the individual who, in Butler and then in Florida, which is the kind of thing [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1584.08s)]
*  that if you are just watching, it's the kind of stuff that is very good at making people [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1593.1999999999998s)]
*  buy into conspiracy theories. Like, that's weird. Why can't they own it? Oh, it's a far known one. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1598.72s)]
*  Maybe there's a lot more questions to answer here. It's like QAnon, anti-vax, if it's like textbook [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1602.8799999999999s)]
*  conspiracy theory spreading. And they want to spread this conspiracy theory. And I know it is [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1608.6399999999999s)]
*  crazy. And it's weird to do it at a economic speech. But this is straight out of the playbook of [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1613.9199999999998s)]
*  tin pot dictators all over the world, is to make themselves a victim that's powerful forces [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1623.04s)]
*  somewhere are trying to take them out because they're such a threat to the system. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1629.04s)]
*  Foreign sources whips up some nationalism. Like they're trying to get the USA and I am the USA. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1632.8s)]
*  Right? Like that's the... I mean, this is why so many people on like online liberals [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1640.0s)]
*  spouted very irresponsibly that this was a false flag. This is why you would have a false flag is [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1649.2s)]
*  for this purpose. There's no evidence there's a false flag. But he's basically like six weeks late [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1654.1599999999999s)]
*  into running the second half of the play here after this. And so it's crazy. It's poorly delivered. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1659.6s)]
*  It seems bizarre, but it's not... It fits with how Trump has and people like Trump have sought [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1666.56s)]
*  power in the past. This is the way I'd say it. I think they're also just trying to squeeze all [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1673.6s)]
*  the political advantage they can out of the two assassination attempts, just to be perfectly [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1679.28s)]
*  honest. We know that the campaign and the Trump believed that after the first assassination attempt, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1684.0s)]
*  they thought they had basically put Joe Biden away, that they saw Trump's approval ratings increase. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1691.04s)]
*  I think they're mad that that didn't last. Right? Because then there was the switch and Kamala Harris [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1696.7199999999998s)]
*  was the nominee and so everyone sort of the coverage of the first assassination attempt [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1701.12s)]
*  faded away and then the second one happened. And so they believe there's sort of a rally around [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1705.36s)]
*  Trump effect and that he was getting some goodwill, not just from his base voters, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1711.52s)]
*  but from other voters. And they want to keep that in people's minds. They're going back to Butler, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1714.9599999999998s)]
*  Pennsylvania, where there was the first attempted assassination on October 5th for rally. He keeps [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1719.12s)]
*  saying he's going to go finish his speech. I'm sure they're going to make a big deal out of that. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1724.4799999999998s)]
*  I just don't know. I don't know how much that that gets you. I think it's a little it's a little weird [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1729.1200000000001s)]
*  to keep talking about the assassination attempt, especially after the after the convention speech, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1736.4s)]
*  the RNC convention speech, his acceptance speech, where he said, I'm only going to tell the story [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1742.16s)]
*  once because it's too painful to ever talk about again. I'm not sure we can stipulate that Donald [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1746.3200000000002s)]
*  Trump's campaign is better in 2024 than it was the other two times. But I don't think it's that good. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1752.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Does it just think about just this is the smallest point on this, but this is the kind of [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1758.24s)]
*  stuff that I obsess over. Why is he speaking in front of a banner that says jobs, jobs, jobs? [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1762.56s)]
*  Because someone in the campaign, someone in the campaign knows that that's the better message. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1768.64s)]
*  Well, yes. But even if you let's say you're just doing an economic event, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1774.0s)]
*  the unemployment rates at historic low. The when you look at all this, the [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1777.36s)]
*  you can say like prices, prices, prices. Yeah, exactly. It's just concerns about jobs are way [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1782.24s)]
*  down because the unemployment rates at historic low. So prices, wages, there are all these other [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1788.16s)]
*  things, lower taxes, all those things. And so you pick jobs, jobs, jobs. It's just very amateur. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1793.6000000000001s)]
*  That's what I'd say. Well, let me tell you, if you thought that that event was weird. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1799.04s)]
*  See, this is my segue. The press conference at Trump Tower on Thursday. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1803.6000000000001s)]
*  Whoo. We tried to grab some clips from it. We're going to do like a supercut. Honestly, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1808.8000000000002s)]
*  though, most of it was too hard to follow. We couldn't even figure out clips. He spent over an [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1815.6000000000001s)]
*  hour rambling and lying about Kamala Harris's trip to Arizona and her record on the border. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1821.2s)]
*  One point he accused her of losing three hundred and twenty five thousand children [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1827.3600000000001s)]
*  to sex trafficking. I couldn't even follow how or why he promised to liberate the city of Aurora. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1832.64s)]
*  OK, he also demanded an apology from ABC News for the debate. He attacked [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1842.96s)]
*  moderators David Muir and Lindsey Davis. He came back around to David Muir after the first time, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1848.8000000000002s)]
*  like 30 minutes later, came back around to attack him again. He called on Nancy Pelosi to be [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1854.5600000000002s)]
*  prosecuted for insider trading and for January 6th. And he talked about Nancy Pelosi because [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1859.28s)]
*  he talked about her trying to push out Biden. And he said that they that Biden only stepped down [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1866.6399999999999s)]
*  because they were threatening him with the 25th Amendment. It was long tangent. He started talking [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1872.16s)]
*  about how he owned property in San Francisco. He said that Caracas, Venezuela had become a safe and [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1878.24s)]
*  wonderful city. Then he took a few questions. This was all before he took the questions. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1883.44s)]
*  And then we took a few questions. He took one about the news that New York City Mayor Eric [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1889.92s)]
*  Adams was indicted Thursday on five federal charges of bribery, fraud and soliciting illegal foreign [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1895.8400000000001s)]
*  campaign donations. And here's what he said. I will say this. I watched about a year ago [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1902.0800000000002s)]
*  when he talked about how the illegal migrants are hurting our city and the federal government [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1909.2800000000002s)]
*  should pay us and we shouldn't have to take him. And I said, You know what? He'll be indicted [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1915.1200000000001s)]
*  within a year. And I was exactly right because that's what we have. We have people that use the [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1920.8000000000002s)]
*  Justice Department and the FBI at levels that have never been seen before. So I wish him luck. I [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1928.4s)]
*  don't know anything about what he did. But so there it is. There it is. Donald Trump [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1935.68s)]
*  defending Eric Adams, the Democratic Mayor of New York, because, hey, if you've been indicted, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1941.6000000000001s)]
*  then you're on Donald Trump's side. Doesn't matter. Party doesn't matter at that point. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1948.0s)]
*  And of course, it was because of and he defended him because he said he was indicted because he [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1953.04s)]
*  was tough on immigration. We had our morning call to talk about the podcast. And we said that Donald [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1959.52s)]
*  Trump had a press conference scheduled for the day. And we said, I wonder if it's about Eric [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1965.28s)]
*  Adams. And John Favreau predicted almost to the word what Donald Trump would say here. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1969.6s)]
*  Knew it. About Eric Adams. I knew that's what he would do. I think it's time. I know you [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1976.32s)]
*  really make some reevaluate some life choices. I've really I've spent too long with this man, [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1981.28s)]
*  but it was like it would it's just it was so obvious. Well, you could sort of see it online [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1985.6s)]
*  too, because all of the like right wing accounts and the blue check marks and the idiots that [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1991.2s)]
*  follow Elon Musk and Silicon Valley, all those dumbasses, they were all starting with the like, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=1996.48s)]
*  oh, the Democrats did this. They had their conspiracies, right? Because what they don't [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2001.2s)]
*  want to admit is that the Biden Justice Department, which they have accused of, you know, weaponization [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2005.8400000000001s)]
*  and going after his political opponents, has indicted the president's son, Hunter Biden, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2013.92s)]
*  Democratic Senator Bob Menendez, Democratic House member Henry Quayar, and now the Democratic [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2020.56s)]
*  mayor of New York, Eric Adams. So did not do a great job of going after Joe Biden's political [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2027.76s)]
*  opponents. No, it does not seem that way at all. Quite an odd conspiracy that they're like, well, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2034.56s)]
*  we got to if we're going to go after Trump, we got to pick five or six Democrats at random, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2039.76s)]
*  including the president's own son to also go after. That's it seems like a real complicated plot. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2044.4s)]
*  But their answer is basically anyone that they've indicted, it's because they haven't done [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2050.0s)]
*  they haven't done what the Biden administration wanted. Right. So Mayor. So Eric Adams was too [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2055.2000000000003s)]
*  tough on immigration. I just I knew Trump would go there. Plus, he just gave a press conference [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2059.6000000000004s)]
*  about immigration. And I figured, oh, there's a perfect it's a perfect confluence of events, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2063.6800000000003s)]
*  Dan. I think the listeners can decide whether this is a positive thing or a negative thing [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2067.84s)]
*  for you. But you absolutely nailed it. What was that press conference, by the way, you and I were [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2071.6000000000004s)]
*  both were like texting while we were listening to that was fucking nuts. I know we say that I have [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2075.84s)]
*  had a press conference, but it in the history of time, I'm not sure any man has been that crazy [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2080.7200000000003s)]
*  and that boring at the same time. Yeah, it is. It's like it was hard to follow. It got really boring. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2088.7200000000003s)]
*  And he had no energy, no energy. And the fact that it was so boring sort of dulled like the [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2096.1600000000003s)]
*  extreme shit he was saying about migrants, like he was doing a lot of the like the the migrant, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2103.2s)]
*  like the gory stories about like rape and murder and all. It was just it was it was it was both [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2110.0s)]
*  disgusting and boring. If that's a if that can be the yeah, it's not just yeah, just terrible, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2118.3199999999997s)]
*  just absolutely terrible to listen to. Not interesting. Alarming that this man is a pointer [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2126.16s)]
*  to away from me, President of the United States. It's just truly terrible. And it was I don't he [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2131.12s)]
*  was looking at notes the whole time. So did someone write that 55 minutes of remarks? [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2136.16s)]
*  I think he would like read a line and then sort of go off on a tangent. I have like a smaller [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2142.88s)]
*  strategic question, which is like, why did he do a press conference at Trump Tower the day before [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2147.7599999999998s)]
*  she goes to the border? Why didn't why not like do something quick after she goes and like get in [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2154.3199999999997s)]
*  the news that it was just very weird? It's just he's not doing very much. He's not even leaving [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2159.6s)]
*  his home. So why is he in Trump Tower to begin with? We just walk downstairs and does this as [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2165.44s)]
*  opposed to why does he go to the border today and preempt her there? I mean, he's he's old and lazy [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2170.0s)]
*  and he his brain is melting before our eyes. It was also amazing to me that he goes on a long [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2176.48s)]
*  defense of Eric Adams, even though he doesn't know much about the case or doesn't know Eric [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2182.24s)]
*  Adams well because in this long thing, the last shouted question he gets is about Mark Robinson, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2187.44s)]
*  lieutenant governor of North Carolina, nude Africa poster, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2192.7200000000003s)]
*  self-proclaimed black Nazi says he wants to bring slavery back. You remember that guy? [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2199.52s)]
*  Hitler. You mean Martin Luther King Jr. on steroids, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2204.4s)]
*  Martin Luther King Jr. on steroids, which is what Donald Trump calls him. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2206.32s)]
*  Interested in his wife's sister in law is interested in his wife's sister. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2211.04s)]
*  I'm not sure. According to nude Africa. Anyway, asked him like, have you are you [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2214.64s)]
*  reconsidering your endorsement of Mark Robinson? Donald Trump's response. Donald Trump, who just [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2221.04s)]
*  went on who just had time to talk for 55 minutes and give a long and rambling answer where he's [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2225.68s)]
*  defending Eric Adams. This is what he said about Mark Robinson. I don't know the situation. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2230.7999999999997s)]
*  I just, I couldn't believe. How can he not just like throw Mark Robinson to the wolves at this [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2235.68s)]
*  point? It's not like Donald Trump has any kind of loyalty. Like it never throws people like that to [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2244.88s)]
*  the wolves though. Yeah. I guess he doesn't want to lose his. He doesn't want to lose the Mark [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2251.04s)]
*  Robinson voters. Are there Mark Robinson voters? I think, I think he'll get 40%. Yeah, I bet. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2254.88s)]
*  But are they Mark Robinson voters or they're just people who vote for any Republican? That's true. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2260.7200000000003s)]
*  That's true. Yeah. Yeah. So then why, then why not? Why not? I don't understand it. I don't [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2264.24s)]
*  understand it. Yeah. I mean, it's hard. We're going to lose a lot of sleep trying to understand this. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2268.64s)]

*  40 days before an election. What is happening? What are we doing? I think, I think that Kamala [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2371.12s)]
*  Harris should speak about this. I think she should like next time she's in an interview, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2378.96s)]
*  she's at a rally. I would do an insert in the rally speech in the stone speech. She should mock [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2384.08s)]
*  the $100,000 thing. She should paint him as this rich guy who doesn't give a shit about people. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2389.28s)]
*  She's already doing that now. Now she's got something that's going to make news. I would [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2394.16s)]
*  put it in an ad that he's doing this. Like this is insane, insane. I agree with all that. She should [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2397.68s)]
*  hammer it. The crypto thing is weird and kind of hard to explain to people. It's hard to make [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2405.76s)]
*  fun of someone for selling Bibles. The trading card thing is weird and hard to understand. NFT's. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2410.2400000000002s)]
*  You left out the sneakers. Sneakers you could do. The sneakers you could do. Yeah. The gold, [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2416.32s)]
*  the gold sneakers. But the $100,000 watch. Obama wanted to do the sneakers in his convention [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2421.44s)]

*  So the sneakers you could do. But the $100,000 watches, I would be doing this. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2437.2000000000003s)]
*  I imagine our friend David Plouffe is salivating over this. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2441.12s)]
*  This is not the biggest point here, but I think my takeaway from this is that Donald Trump has [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2448.56s)]
*  fully become Fox News. His speeches- He's going to be selling Trump catheters soon. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2452.32s)]
*  Our Hannity and everything else is just one long Fox commercial. It's the sort of thing. So an [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2457.84s)]
*  gold sneaker. Don't say that's going to happen. I know. Somewhere, Dodd Jr. is working on that. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2463.12s)]
*  I don't know, man. I don't know. If you can't, like, if we're going to, if we elect this, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2475.04s)]
*  I mean, who knows where it's a tie race. It's a tie race. And he's got an advantage on the economy [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2480.32s)]
*  is he's out there selling $100,000 watches. People are most upset that costs are too high. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2484.48s)]
*  They can't afford a home, can't afford groceries, $100,000 watches. Who's buying that? [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2491.04s)]
*  Reid wants everyone to know- I want to listen to the people who do. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2498.56s)]
*  Reid, who produces this show and writes this show, wants us to know that the fighter watch [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2500.96s)]
*  can be yours for as little as $500. That it's not, there is a low price point for folks who don't, [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2505.92s)]
*  who can't afford the $100,000. So I guess just to be fair. Did Reid just Daniel Dale us? [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2511.68s)]
*  He was very concerned that, you know, we just want to make sure that the $100,000, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2521.6s)]
*  that's the top, that's the top echelon. That's the high price point. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2525.3599999999997s)]
*  Reid Reid is remote, but I'm going to take a close look in the next couple of weeks to see [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2528.48s)]
*  if he's got a fighter watch on his wrist. It does come with a handwritten letter from [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2532.72s)]
*  Trump. So I do think that that's, that's cool. All right. I'm sure he personally signed all of [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2538.0s)]

*  to 2024. Welcome back, Melissa. Thanks for having me. Great to be back. So I want to start with a [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2737.6000000000004s)]
*  clip from the special where you and Simone are sitting down with some young black women at a [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2742.8s)]
*  nail salon who have contemplated sitting out this election. Let's listen. How are folks feeling [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2747.84s)]
*  about this election season? It's crazy to say the least. Yeah, I'm feeling a little iffy. The [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2753.68s)]
*  first time that I was able to vote was for Hillary Clinton. That was my first and last time because [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2759.04s)]
*  I felt like, okay, I felt hope that Hillary would win. I felt excitement from the community around [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2764.8799999999997s)]
*  me. I just had so much hope and then look what happened. And so now I'm like, did my vote really [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2771.12s)]
*  matter? I don't know. Were you excited to vote before the switch or were you just going to sit [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2777.04s)]
*  it out? I was probably going to sit it out as well. Oh, I agree. I was definitely setting it out. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2783.52s)]
*  I was not voting at all before the switch. I'm still up in the air. Obviously I'm a Muslim woman. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2790.56s)]
*  So it's very nerve racking and very scary for me. It's already hard wearing hijab in public. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2796.8s)]
*  So when you talk about things like Project 25, it's kind of scary. So I love hearing from [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2806.0s)]
*  undecided or persuadable voters, even if what they say is frustrating or frightening, which it often [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2812.64s)]
*  is. How many did you guys talk to? Where and what else did you hear? Was that typical of what you [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2818.0s)]
*  heard? So we talked to a lot of women. I mean, these weren't focus groups in the way that you [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2825.7599999999998s)]
*  and Sarah Longwell have done on other shows, but we did talk to a pretty broad cross section of [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2830.0s)]
*  women. So there are women who were older, like in their forties and fifties, and they had very [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2835.36s)]
*  distinct views. This group of women were true millennials, like 28 years old to 32 years old. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2839.92s)]
*  And we met at this nail salon, the Cosmo Beauty Bar in Washington, D.C. And I have to say, [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2847.04s)]
*  I've never felt so old. When they asked me, what would you like to do with your nails? I was like, [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2853.04s)]
*  I would like them short and finger colored. And they're like, we haven't done anything like that [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2857.12s)]
*  since 1994. So I got a true education in all of the new nail techniques that are available. But I [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2861.7599999999998s)]
*  also got a real education about what younger women are thinking. And one of the things that [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2869.68s)]
*  struck me is that we are hearing constantly in the media that black women are just ride or die for [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2874.24s)]
*  the Democratic Party. And I just don't think that's true. It's not true for these women. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2880.3199999999997s)]
*  They feel overlooked. I think all of the black women that we talked to felt overlooked by the [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2886.08s)]
*  traditional political parties, that their votes were either taken for granted or were overlooked [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2891.2s)]
*  entirely. But for these younger women, they really felt that no one was sort of speaking to them. And [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2896.48s)]
*  to be really clear, some of their complaints didn't strike me as being entirely plausible. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2904.48s)]
*  And that's not because they're wrong. I think it is a failure of messaging. So, you know, there was [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2910.56s)]
*  this one really interesting discussion about how much they were invested in student loan relief. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2915.12s)]
*  And student loan relief actually did happen. And then it was sort of withdrawn by the United States [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2920.4s)]
*  Supreme Court. And, you know, they hadn't really heard about it. No one that they knew had gotten [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2925.8399999999997s)]
*  student loan relief. And in their view, the administration was not talking about their [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2931.6s)]
*  successes in having student loan relief go forward. And then the failure of having that [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2936.08s)]
*  eradicated by the Supreme Court in one fell swoop. So there are a lot of really interesting [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2941.52s)]
*  questions here, some of it about messaging, but also some of it about really appealing to these [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2945.7599999999998s)]
*  voters where they are. What are what were some of the issues that they spoke most about and [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2949.52s)]
*  some concerns they had with with the administration? So one issue that was a particular concern, they [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2956.64s)]
*  lived in Washington, D.C. Most of them did. Some were from other states like North Carolina. But [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2962.8s)]
*  police violence was a big issue. And again, it was hard to sort of understand where they were [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2967.2s)]
*  coming from on this. Like, you know, they wanted the administration to do more and be more proactive [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2973.6s)]
*  about addressing police violence. But, you know, I think there was a misunderstanding about what [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2978.64s)]
*  any presidential administration can do about the 18,000 police departments that are actually under [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2983.7599999999998s)]
*  local and municipal control. And in fact, the Biden administration did a really big effort with an [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2988.8799999999997s)]
*  executive order that provided lots of funding to local and state offices to track police violence, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=2994.72s)]
*  to do better training, things of that nature. They weren't really clear on that piece of it. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3001.04s)]
*  And I think that is actually a failure of messaging from the administration, maybe also a failure [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3005.2799999999997s)]
*  on the part of those of us in the media, because, you know, for the last year and a half, we all [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3010.3999999999996s)]
*  we've talked about is Donald Trump and his criminality. We haven't talked about some of [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3015.12s)]
*  the other things that the administration has done to address really pertinent and entrenched [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3020.08s)]
*  problems like police violence. So that was one thing they talked a lot about. Student loan relief, [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3026.08s)]
*  reproductive rights was a big issue. And they all recognized that it was salient, but it still [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3030.88s)]
*  wasn't enough to ensure that they were going to the polls. You talked about messaging. What do you [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3036.88s)]
*  think Kamala Harris needs to do to sort of close the sale with some of these voters? So we spoke [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3041.52s)]
*  with these young women after the switch had happened. We spoke with another group of older [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3048.08s)]
*  voters right after the debate. And that was actually a very interesting conversation. But [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3051.7599999999998s)]
*  even after the switch had happened and Harris was the nominee going forward for the Democratic Party, [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3057.04s)]
*  they wanted real specifics from her. What are you going to do? So I think this was a little [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3063.04s)]
*  bit before she started articulating some of the particulars of her plan, certainly on the home [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3066.4s)]
*  ownership piece. But they wanted to know what she was going to do specifically about reproductive [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3071.2799999999997s)]
*  rights. And again, not a ton that a presidential administration can do without having a congress [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3075.84s)]
*  and work being done in other branches of government. But they wanted more particulars. How are you [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3082.6400000000003s)]
*  going to shore up Roe versus Wade? What is that going to look like? Can I get behind this? And so [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3087.44s)]
*  that was really important, I think very, very particular to her. They just felt she was a bit [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3093.52s)]
*  of a cipher at that point, and they wanted someone to fill it in. Democrats' struggles with young [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3099.52s)]
*  black men have been a major topic of conversation this cycle. So I'm very excited to have something [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3104.0s)]
*  entirely new to worry about. So thank you for that. Do you have a sense of whether it's similar [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3106.96s)]
*  dynamics going on with young black women? Is there something different going on? Is there something [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3112.96s)]
*  specific Democrats should be doing to address these concerns? Sure. I actually do think there [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3117.76s)]
*  is a difference here. And I too have heard all of the discussion about how Trump curious young black [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3124.16s)]
*  men are. I did not get the sense that these women were Trump curious at all. The woman who [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3129.68s)]
*  previously spoke who was in the hijab, she was just very clear, I am not voting for Donald Trump. I [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3135.6s)]
*  don't like him. I think he's a criminal. They were very clear. This was really more a question of, [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3141.2799999999997s)]
*  am I even going to get out of the House on Tuesday, November 5th, to vote at all? And so this is really [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3146.56s)]
*  more, is there anything that's going to animate me to get on board with Kamala Harris and the [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3152.8799999999997s)]
*  Democrats, not what is pushing me towards Trump. So I think it's a different kind of conversation. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3158.0s)]
*  I think one of the things the Democrats really need to think about is how they message what [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3163.76s)]
*  they've done and also how what they've done is being received. And we talk a lot about low [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3170.32s)]
*  information voters. I think it's unfair to talk about them in that way, because it sounds as though [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3175.92s)]
*  they are purposefully disengaged. And that's not true. But it did occur to me when I was talking [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3181.12s)]
*  to them that these are young women who came of age after 9-11, after No Child Left Behind, when [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3186.88s)]
*  we as a country systematically stripped public education of superfluous things like P.E. and music [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3195.6s)]
*  and art and civics education. So it's not surprising, perhaps, that they don't understand that [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3202.48s)]
*  the police departments don't get dictated to by a presidential administration. It's not surprising [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3209.76s)]
*  that they may not understand precisely that the president has to work with Congress to pass a [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3216.4s)]
*  domestic agenda. So we have really made them ill-equipped to understand how government works [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3222.64s)]
*  in a very particular way. And that's a real problem. I mean, an electorate that doesn't [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3228.96s)]
*  understand how government work is an electorate that can be preyed upon with misinformation. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3234.56s)]
*  And that's exactly what we're seeing. There is a conversation we had about how Democrats [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3238.8s)]
*  talk about their accomplishments, what we say, how we make it matter to people. There's also [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3242.8s)]
*  brought a question of how do we reach these people? Because I agree with you, low information voters [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3246.16s)]
*  it's a pejorative way of discussing it. But most voters, most people in this country do not engage [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3250.48s)]
*  with news in a real way. The distribution mechanisms of news are sort of broken. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3255.92s)]
*  Did you get any sense of where these people are getting their political information, platforms, [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3260.72s)]
*  or media outlets that maybe the Harris campaign or other Democrats should go on to actually [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3264.08s)]
*  inject themselves in front of these voters? So they talked about getting a lot of their [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3267.36s)]
*  information from social media and podcasts and sort of YouTube shows. So Hot Ones was mentioned. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3272.32s)]
*  And I think those are really important platforms. It's not traditional news media. It's not even [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3278.7200000000003s)]
*  cable news, which I think for a lot of them, that seemed like my parents' media. They're getting it [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3285.92s)]
*  from a bunch of different sources. And I think it's important for her to sort of meet them where [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3292.0s)]
*  they are. And it's non-traditional media. But I also think, again, it's worth thinking about [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3295.84s)]
*  is it the case that we can only understand what the government does and how they do it if we go to law [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3302.96s)]
*  school, if we took constitutional law? There's a real gap here and we are going to have to address [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3308.2400000000002s)]
*  that going forward. I mean, it's all of a piece with these book bands and preventing people from [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3313.6800000000003s)]
*  having certain kinds of curricula. It's all of a piece. Like you make it harder for people to [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3318.6400000000003s)]
*  understand what's happening. You don't give them the tools to be able to critically assess it. And [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3323.84s)]
*  I think it's a lot easier to sort of put one over on them. I know you guys talk to some voters and [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3329.6000000000004s)]
*  other black women in politics and leadership roles. What was your main takeaway from the [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3336.56s)]
*  entire special? Like what did you walk away with? So black women are deeply engaged with the issues. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3345.6800000000003s)]
*  They understand that this election is probably unlike other elections. All of them seem to [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3353.44s)]
*  understand the kind of existential crisis that undergirds this election. I think some of the [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3359.6s)]
*  older women were just much more explicit about it. But even the younger women were like, this is the [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3365.04s)]
*  election that I'm voting on because if I'm voting, I'm voting for my kids. That was very palpable and [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3370.3199999999997s)]
*  very clear. They are engaged. Their levels of engagement are different. But to a person, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3377.04s)]
*  they all feel a little misunderstood by those who are power. The women we talk to in the suburb [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3383.2s)]
*  say that when they talk about suburban women, they're not talking about me. And the younger [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3390.08s)]
*  women feel like they've been completely overlooked. The attention we're spending on young black men [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3393.68s)]
*  talking about what animates them. We're not spending the same kind of attention talking about [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3398.24s)]
*  what is animating young black women or what is keeping them at home when they might be out there [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3402.0s)]
*  voting. So this is a sector of the electorate that's regarded as reliable and diehard. But in [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3406.8s)]
*  fact, they're more wobbly than you think. Yeah. Well, I'm really glad you guys did the special. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arVctepfro&t=3413.1200000000003s)]
