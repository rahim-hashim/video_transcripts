Video Description: And so it begins—again. In front of an audience of adoring billionaires, Donald Trump takes the oath of office, delivers a speech promising a return to American greatness, and vows to make drastic changes to federal policy on immigration, gender identity, energy, and more. Meanwhile, Joe Biden ends his presidency with preemptive pardons for Liz Cheney, Anthony Fauci, and members of his immediate family. Jon, Lovett, Tommy, and Dan react to Trump's big speech, his planned executive orders, and Biden's final moves. Then they offer their thoughts on how we can all survive the next four years with our sanity intact.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

# Donald Trump is President Again and Announces Slew of Executive Actions
**Pod Save America:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4)
*  Welcome to Pod Save America. I'm Jon Favreau. I'm Jon Lovett. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Dan Pfeiffer. We did it guys [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=0.0s)]
*  We did it. It's Monday afternoon East Coast time and in the words of Florida Congressman Byron Donald's daddy's home [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  The lame-duck presidency of our oldest and first criminally convicted chief executive has begun its former president [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=15.4s)]
*  Donald J [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Trump just became current president Donald J Trump during a ceremony held in the very place the mob he incited four years ago [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=22.8s)]
*  Tried to overturn the election. He lost [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=29.72s)]
*  What a country [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=33.0s)]
*  Tommy Lovett and I are here at the Sirius XM studios in snowy, New York [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=35.2s)]
*  Dan is joining us remotely from rebel-held San Francisco [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=39.96s)]
*  Obviously lots to go through here [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=45.84s)]
*  But yeah, let's just start with the speech the inaugural address was moved inside the Capitol building because of extreme cold and maybe as a result [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=47.4s)]
*  Of that the whole thing felt a little bit more like a State of the Union address than a traditional inaugural [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  Let's listen to some of the clips. My recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  betrayal and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=66.64s)]
*  all of these many betrayals that have taken place and to give the people back their faith their wealth their [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=68.16s)]
*  democracy and indeed their freedom [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=77.47999999999999s)]
*  from this moment on [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  America's decline is over [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=83.8s)]
*  January 20th 2025 is [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=87.32000000000001s)]
*  Liberation Day [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=91.88000000000001s)]
*  As we gather today our government confronts a crisis of trust [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=93.68s)]
*  For many years a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens while the pillars of our society [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  Lay broken many people thought it was impossible for me to stage such a historic political comeback [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=106.76s)]
*  But as you see today here I am the American people have spoken [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=115.16s)]
*  Here I am the American people have spoken can't argue with that Dan let's start with you thoughts on the speech [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=121.0s)]
*  I mean it's just the whole thing was so surreal [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=126.96s)]
*  Right as you pointed out in your opening you have here of Donald Trump standing in the Capitol the building that four years ago [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=130.04s)]
*  He incited a mob to [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=135.0s)]
*  try to assault [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=137.24s)]
*  He delivers this speech which in some ways feel like you you say it feels like state of the union is in the capital [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=139.0s)]
*  also felt like a state of the union in the sense that it was a laundry list of [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  Policy ideas sort of weaving together woven together in a very incoherent fashion [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=147.52s)]
*  But just you take the words if you just read the like the transcript of speech [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=152.36s)]
*  It reads like the words of a fascist dictator [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=157.34s)]
*  But delivered with the energy and cadence of a middle manager at a sales conference. You're just very [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=159.84s)]
*  low [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=166.52s)]
*  Energy and which we would look we would soon learn why because then he would go give a second speech [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=167.96s)]
*  Moments later where he just did the full shtick all the things he wanted to say did the whole Trump routine [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=173.68s)]
*  This was the the speech for [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=179.54000000000002s)]
*  The AIDS who told him to be disciplined, I guess but you know not a great speech. Love it [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=182.08s)]
*  What do you think as a speechwriter yourself? Oh, well, yeah as a speechwriter. I was disappointed [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=187.32s)]
*  There was a moment when before Trump even get up there when [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=194.76000000000002s)]
*  Franklin Graham got up there to give I don't know what it's technically called invocation convocation and he said [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=200.0s)]
*  The last four years have been very dark, which is just not what you would typically say in a moment like this [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=206.4s)]
*  Especially since the Joe Biden is [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=211.24s)]
*  Sitting right behind him that woke him up. It did and and you had just kidding. I did know he was up. He was up [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=213.76000000000002s)]
*  He was focused [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=221.28s)]
*  but [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=223.08s)]
*  It's very look like the inaugural [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=224.20000000000002s)]
*  Address is meant to be I mean he he like kind of tilts at it being this unifying event [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=227.8s)]
*  But first of all, this is a speech taking place in a weekend of political [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=232.76000000000002s)]
*  rallies and [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=237.76000000000002s)]
*  was immediately [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=239.84s)]
*  politicized by the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=241.56s)]
*  Reverend meant to be doing a kind of religious invocation [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=243.08s)]
*  and so he gave basically a version of a stump speech and yes, it was the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=246.76000000000002s)]
*  The the one the stump the stump speech version when he takes out all the stuff that they begged him to take out which they [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=250.48s)]
*  Successfully got him to take out which he does later [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=255.95999999999998s)]
*  But it was still a stump speech still a deeply political and small speech for inauguration [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=257.76s)]
*  Tommy January 20th 2025 is Liberation Day is just a giant Bill Pullman ripoff from Independence Day. Yeah, no aliens [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=261.92s)]
*  How dare you yet? First of all, it's funny also that Dan criticized Trump for being too wonky to policy focused [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=269.24s)]
*  Didn't expect that I like I sort of it is some reaction [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=275.52s)]
*  Like it was sort of remarkable in how unremarkable it was like my memory of the 2017 inaugural address is all that one line [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=278.72s)]
*  About American carnage and then I rewatched that speech after I watched the 2025 version [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=284.88000000000005s)]
*  And it's actually amazing how similar the two speeches are. He we're gonna make America great again [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=291.40000000000003s)]
*  We're gonna protect our borders some hand waving about unity [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=297.72s)]
*  He updates this one with new more modern grievances like the judicial system being weaponized the battle against inflation and the need to invade [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=300.20000000000005s)]
*  Panama, but there's like verbatim lines at the top like in 2017 [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=308.24s)]
*  He said for too long a small group in our nation's capital have reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=312.1s)]
*  2025 for many years a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens while the pillars of our society lay broken [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=317.48s)]
*  And seemingly in complete disrepair. So it was you know, it just kind of like stump like the same thing. I did note though [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=323.64s)]
*  for all Joe Biden's [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=331.24s)]
*  Attempts in efforts to be a decent person and have a dignified transfer of power Trump still [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=332.8s)]
*  Took a dump on his entire presidency in existence right next to him. So that was um kind of him cordial of him gracious gracious [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=339.56s)]
*  it does feel like [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  this speech [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=349.6s)]
*  As much as I didn't care for the content that much of the speech [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=351.48s)]
*  I kind of like the trend overall of getting away from the sweeping rhetoric of an inaugural address [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=354.54s)]
*  That's like meant for the history books and just like getting right to business [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=361.42s)]
*  He didn't quite do that completely like half of it was the Stephen Miller. Yeah, of cliched fascism [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=365.06s)]
*  I'll call it. That's the sort of Stephen Miller style. It's like proud boys crossing the Delaware [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=372.02s)]
*  It's a phishistic rhetoric that's not like we've all heard before and it's not a lot of creativity behind it [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=376.58s)]
*  It's just sort of lame [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=381.38s)]
*  And then it just got like very specific very very quickly [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=382.82s)]
*  But to me that's like a little more modern, you know, like I'm the next Democratic president [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=386.02s)]
*  I'd like them just to get to business just talk to just talk about what they're gonna do for the country [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=390.74s)]
*  Yeah [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=394.1s)]
*  The what I was really feeling when I was watching him speak is oh eight years ago when Trump addressed the country [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=394.5s)]
*  He did it really kind of unsure of what it was what it meant to be president and what rules he had to respect and [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=399.66s)]
*  What rules he didn't what customs he believed in and had value in which customs he didn't and now I do think he like these [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=405.94s)]
*  Speeches that are for everybody. He doesn't give a fuck about them. He doesn't care what the media says [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=412.54s)]
*  He doesn't care other covered [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=416.64s)]
*  He doesn't really see much of the value of it [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=417.74s)]
*  Donald Trump gave two speeches he gave his inaugural and then he went to this overflow his speech of the overflow was longer than [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=419.66s)]
*  the one he gave [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=425.34000000000003s)]
*  At the inaugural that was the real Donald Trump. This is the the Donald Trump he has to do [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=427.34000000000003s)]
*  Once in a while for the squares not for nothing. It was also the most like self-involved self-referential [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=432.22s)]
*  Inaugural of all time maybe I think that beats his first but I don't know Tommy [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=438.98s)]
*  You just listen to the first one again [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=442.82s)]
*  So you you tell me if I'm wrong, but like talks about the assassination attempt fine [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=443.78s)]
*  But then you know [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=448.65999999999997s)]
*  It is my hope that our recent presidential election will be remembered as the greatest and most consequential [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=450.14s)]
*  Election in the history of our country first inaugural reference swing states [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=454.46s)]
*  They tried to yeah, so talking about swing states his election results [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=459.5s)]
*  So they tried to take away my freedom and my life again [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=462.94s)]
*  he's confound, you know conflates him breaking the law and then people trying to investigate him with a [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=466.02s)]
*  Assassin that had apparently no political leanings really that just that just tried to take his life. So it's very [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=472.06s)]
*  You know, he's focused on what's important, which is him. He said he's on a mission from God to save America [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=478.9s)]
*  You know you think yeah, so there's a so you want to say there's a dose of humility in this, right? Yes. Yes [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=484.71999999999997s)]
*  Speech wasn't the only component of the weekend's big celebration [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=490.74s)]

*  He gave to the overflow room which is longer than the 29 minute inaugural address [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=524.52s)]
*  Which also by the way, I guess is the longest inaugural address since Roosevelt in the modern era, which is wild [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=529.4s)]
*  There were also a lot of balls big parties [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=535.4s)]

*  There's though the vibes the vibes in Washington this weekend. Anyone have any thoughts? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=550.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, I think moving all the events inside and only doing things with tech CEOs and billionaire donors while the MAGA faithful [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=553.8s)]
*  Nothing to do or go to some giant arena where they get ignored [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=561.04s)]
*  That's kind of a perfect metaphor for how I imagine this whole thing is gonna go and look at history is any good [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=564.4399999999999s)]
*  You want to keep those folks busy? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=568.5999999999999s)]
*  Marching through the streets idle hands [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=572.4799999999999s)]
*  Devil's playground, but I mean I do think this is why you're seeing like the Steve Bannon [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=574.8s)]
*  Fight against Elon Musk and the tech oligarchs because they are worried that their [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=579.0799999999999s)]
*  Populism is erasing the minute the votes were counted and they're not wrong [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=583.9599999999999s)]
*  Yes, this weekend is the the you know, he's about to take office [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=588.1999999999999s)]
*  It's his final chance to do open corruption before he's actually president so that the corruption he can do well president begins [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=592.04s)]
*  But it felt like the end of any pretense that he's not going to just be openly corrupt and basically sell access [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=600.76s)]
*  To the White House to these people. I mean, that's what this weekend was. It was a big sale and [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=607.44s)]
*  I was thinking like like oh like maybe he's [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=611.76s)]
*  maybe he's sort of [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=615.72s)]
*  Empathetic to people who like waiters and servers who work for tips because he's gonna be the first president [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=617.5600000000001s)]
*  That does work for tips, which I think is some shit that is exciting [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=624.1600000000001s)]
*  You know, don't forget to tip your president. Yeah, which is I think the motto of this weekend. That's right [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=628.5200000000001s)]
*  He did he just wants he wants to be a host. Yeah [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=633.0400000000001s)]

*  Workshopping that idea workshop in that [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=643.8000000000001s)]
*  One other notable moment to that to that end in the speech [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=646.8000000000001s)]
*  He he referenced the fires in Los Angeles at one point. Apparently he's going to Los Angeles on Friday [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=650.96s)]
*  and [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=657.72s)]
*  You know, he brought up the fires. He also brought up Hurricane Helene because he wanted to basically show that [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=658.84s)]
*  Leadership that's not him is incompetent and all that kind of stuff [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=664.88s)]
*  But he also said this when he was talking about the fires or more recently Los Angeles where we're watching fires still tragically burn [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=668.5600000000001s)]
*  from weeks ago without even a [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=677.4000000000001s)]
*  token of defense [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=680.1s)]
*  They're raging through the houses and communities even affecting some of the wealthiest and most powerful individuals in our country [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=682.1600000000001s)]
*  Some of whom are sitting here right now [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=689.5400000000001s)]
*  They don't have a home any longer [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=692.5s)]
*  That's interesting. That is interesting. Who was he talking about that doesn't have a lost a home that was on the dais [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=694.9s)]
*  I did not know that natural disasters could harm rich people. That's news. I mean that is this point to me [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=701.52s)]
*  Yeah, exactly what he's in [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=707.56s)]
*  Legitimate shock that the rich and powerful could be affected by something like this [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=709.62s)]
*  Yeah, it is [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=712.98s)]
*  I mean [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=713.54s)]
*  I guess it's somewhat reassuring to know that we have oligarchs in Los Angeles because at least that means we'll have to get some [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=713.8199999999999s)]
*  Some protection from the federal government if we need it. Yeah, someone's summer house in Malibu probably got hit. I don't know [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=717.9000000000001s)]
*  Oh, I don't think we're getting protection from I don't think I think they're gonna hire their own protection. No, that's right [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=722.86s)]
*  But yeah, I just sort of there's a weird line. Well, just a reminder like what it is [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=727.22s)]
*  Seriously, it sounds like oh, maybe someone started it to target them. Like that was my takeaway in the moment [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=732.74s)]
*  what I took away from it was [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=737.1s)]
*  there's some rich person there who [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=738.7800000000001s)]
*  may have lost their house, which is terrible and [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=741.0200000000001s)]
*  We this is how Donald Trump governs someone nearby him told him this story and now he is recounting it and the literally thinks [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=743.86s)]

*  I wonder if people lost their homes flipping on tik-tok or any other policies that are gonna come out of this administration [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=755.34s)]
*  They are gonna run through a gauntlet of rich people talking to Donald Trump directly about them [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=760.78s)]
*  Casually in the places Donald Trump hangs out with his biggest backers and that's what that's what I took from this [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=765.62s)]
*  He also said that in the overflow speech that maybe Nancy Pelosi wanted January 6 to happen and that's why she turned down the [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=771.58s)]
*  10,000 troops he says he offered [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=779.14s)]
*  And noted that she's guilty as hell. So that that was said in the Capitol where the insurrection happened four years ago [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=781.1800000000001s)]

*  They can try what are they gonna do? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1046.8600000000001s)]
*  What are they gonna do do a lot? Do a lot of eggs go through the Panama Canal? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1049.8200000000002s)]
*  I'm just wondering is that the price of eggs? What's what's that? Is that how we're lower? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1054.18s)]
*  Is that how we're lower inflation? I guess more things through the Panama Canal a huge chunk of American [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1058.0600000000002s)]
*  Shipping goes through the Panama Canal [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1064.74s)]
*  It has gotten more expensive, but that's mostly because of drought people usually attribute to climate change not China [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1067.14s)]
*  Listen Donald Trump is pretty clear about this [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1073.1s)]
*  He is very comfortable with the Chinese government controlling the brains of America's young people [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1075.18s)]
*  But not the canal do you see the tick-tock CEO sitting next to Tulsi Gabbard the future director of national intelligence [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1079.78s)]
*  What a country what a country what a time Dan. What do you think just from a public opinion perspective? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1084.7s)]
*  How do you think you think the country is? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1090.14s)]
*  clamoring for [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1093.14s)]
*  New name for the Gulf of Mexico. He also said he's gonna mount mount. It's gonna be Mount McKinley again [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1094.9s)]
*  It was Denali Mount Denali for a while. We're saying Mount McKinley again saying Mount McKinley saying Merry Christmas again [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1099.9s)]
*  We're saying Gulf of America for the first time [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1106.18s)]
*  We're seizing Panama hopefully not by force if necessary, but we're not ruling it out [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1108.3400000000001s)]
*  But we're not ruling it out Greenland Greenland got the shaft in this speech [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1113.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, no mention of Greenland nothing about the 51st state either and just Justin Trudeau [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1116.74s)]
*  Outgoing prime minister Dan. What do you think of these all is this what people wanted when they voted in November? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1122.94s)]
*  Well, fortunately for us John we have polling that shows a 57% of Americans oppose [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1127.22s)]
*  Donald Trump using [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1132.5s)]
*  coercion either military or economic to seize the Panama Canal back [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1134.26s)]
*  So Trump and love it on the wrong side of that one wimps say similar numbers on Greenland [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1138.9s)]
*  American people are not interested in Greenland or pay at the Panama Canal. I heard if I heard a talk once [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1143.94s)]
*  About Greenland and how the harsh and unforgiving climate there obviously [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1149.6200000000001s)]
*  It is it isn't green and I hope someone tells Trump that soon [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1154.8600000000001s)]
*  But that the person in this sort of Danish accent said [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1158.6200000000001s)]
*  Describing the mile-high glaciers and the impossible conditions and it was asked what would happen if someone invaded Greenland? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1163.14s)]
*  And he said if someone were to invade Greenland, we'd immediately rescue them [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1169.6200000000001s)]
*  Another kind of foreign policy Jason one is he said he's gonna immediately or not immediately he's gonna designate [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1176.02s)]
*  Drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1181.5s)]
*  I'm just very interested to see what that means in practice because there's lots of reporting about connections between the Mexican government and the cartels [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1183.96s)]
*  elected officials or the Mexican military and these cartels [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1190.1000000000001s)]
*  I want to know are they gonna get tagged with providing material support? [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1193.66s)]
*  Are we gonna go back to the campaign rhetoric where we all were talking about? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1196.6200000000001s)]
*  Using the US military to bomb Mexico bomb the cartel drug manufacturing [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1200.5s)]
*  So kind of a pincer move [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1206.8200000000002s)]
*  I mean I guess my like we'll talk about this later [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1209.1399999999999s)]
*  But my modus operandi for Trump 2.0 is to take it all literally and assume he's gonna do these things [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1211.9399999999998s)]
*  So if we're gonna call them terrorists presumably then you kill the terrorists because that's usually what you do with terrorists [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1218.74s)]
*  If you're an American government, so stay tuned. I would just say Tommy [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1223.78s)]
*  This is the entire plot line of special ops lioness season 2. What was it? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1227.4399999999998s)]
*  It doesn't it well for anyone. Is that a video game is a TV show that is it's on Paramount Plus [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1231.34s)]
*  Sheridan show it's also the makers of Yellowstone. It's also [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1236.18s)]
*  Jason Tommy Vitor just watching his press TV. Sorry [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1240.54s)]
*  Severance you elite prick [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1245.62s)]
*  We're watching you Dan and I are watching Yellowstone [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1248.26s)]
*  Lioness to what was it called special ops lioness to it is also the plot of clear and present danger [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1252.46s)]
*  That's a great movie, which is a movie where the the whole plot revolves around once the American people find out [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1257.7s)]
*  There'll be hell to pay which is a simpler time [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1263.02s)]
*  Put a button on the whole Panama thing. How [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1266.62s)]
*  How does this work? Like is it they just what are the options here outside of military force? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1269.62s)]
*  He like tries to levy tariffs on Panama economic pressure. I don't understand. I think that Greenland [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1275.02s)]
*  He really does want the territory [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1281.02s)]
*  I think with Panama is probably just getting trying to get a better deal a better rate [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1282.34s)]
*  But I'm as far as I can design I looked into this a couple weeks ago when he started talking about it again [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1286.36s)]
*  I think that they are charging us the same rate as everyone else this this yeah, I see the Panama Canal Authority [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1290.96s)]
*  There's a company based in Hong Kong that won a bid [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1297.5200000000002s)]
*  To control some aspect of shipping. Yeah, and they charge everybody [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1301.3600000000001s)]
*  I think this is all kind of a bullshit way of describing what it's ultimately a commercial debate, right? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1305.48s)]
*  I think the the big big picture on this is [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1311.5600000000002s)]
*  Trump's brain was frozen in the 70s and he remembers when Reagan used to attack Jimmy Carter over the Panama Canal all the time [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1314.8799999999999s)]
*  And it was a huge political issue and he's just bringing it back [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1321.96s)]
*  Yeah, and there was there was a mention of manifest destiny in the speech again. That was about [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1325.3999999999999s)]
*  We're going to Mars sick. You know, I'm was very excited behind him. We're going to Mars. We're taking Greenland [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1331.48s)]
*  We're taking Panama. You can tell that he is serious about all right. I'm a lame duck president [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1337.62s)]
*  What's my legacy gonna be I want it? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1342.24s)]
*  I want to name I've named buildings Trump my whole life and I want to name large land masses Trump [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1344.32s)]
*  And take take them over for America. That's it seems like that's a vibe that he's yeah quite serious about [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1349.84s)]
*  I think it's the kind of thing where like like a studio during a studio during pilot season [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1355.1200000000001s)]
*  He's gonna throw a couple pitches out there and hope hope one becomes a hit much like lioness [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1359.8s)]
*  Yeah, much like lioness season two Tommy. What's the process for renaming the Gulf of Mexico? I don't know [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1364.92s)]
*  I think love it was googling this [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1370.04s)]
*  I believe don't tell people all the magic [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1373.08s)]
*  As I said to that professor on the phone beforehand [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1378.12s)]
*  It seems like he can unilaterally name things but other countries don't have to recognize him [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1382.2s)]
*  He can just order the federal government's maps and so forth to identify the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1386.56s)]
*  But that doesn't mean other countries are gonna suddenly print Gulf of America [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1391.24s)]
*  Well, and what was that and they'll be and then they'll be pretty sorry once they're invaded, right? Right? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1394.68s)]
*  What when we were laughing at what it Claudia Shane bomb that the new president of Mexico [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1399.08s)]
*  Threatened to call the United States like greater Mexico or something Mexico Mexico America [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1403.28s)]
*  Mexican America something like that. Yeah, a little nationalism meeting nationalism good for her [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1407.3999999999999s)]
*  Trump did spend a lot of the speech laying out his plans for signing a slew of long rumored executive orders [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1411.6799999999998s)]
*  Which he described this way today. I will sign a series of historic [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1417.3999999999999s)]
*  executive orders [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1422.36s)]
*  with these actions we will begin the complete restoration of America and the [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1423.72s)]
*  Revolution of common sense. It's all about common sense. I [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1429.56s)]
*  Think Biden chuckled at that one that the common sense which good for him he should [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1435.1599999999999s)]
*  So here are just a few of the ones he talked about [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1439.6399999999999s)]
*  And the ones that have been reported that some he has already signed some he's in the process of signing hard to tell [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1442.48s)]
*  11 executive orders on the border alone including ending birthright citizenship for the kids of undocumented immigrants [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1448.1599999999999s)]
*  Reinstating the remain in Mexico policy laying the groundwork to send troops to the border [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1454.6399999999999s)]
*  as Tommy mentioned designated drug cartels for as foreign terrorist organizations and [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1458.92s)]
*  Also invoking the alien enemies act of 1798 to expedite the removal of foreign-born criminals. That's immigration [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1464.56s)]
*  He also is gonna sign an executive order to quote declaring that there are only two genders [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1471.12s)]
*  aiming to end trans protections and the idea of gender identity [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1477.44s)]
*  Within any kind of federal government office service, etc. So for example [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1482.32s)]
*  passports [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1489.0s)]
*  Will only be two genders [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1490.28s)]
*  He'll also require the prisoners in the federal system be housed according to their sex at birth [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1492.56s)]
*  It'd be declaring a national energy emergency [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1498.12s)]
*  Whatever that means in order to expedite more drilling and fossil fuel production and ending the electric vehicle mandate [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1501.12s)]
*  That wasn't really a thing that he says is killing America [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1508.7s)]
*  He's signing an EO creating the Department of Government Efficiency or as we've all come to know and love it as Doge [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1513.3s)]
*  Which by the way the vague Ramaswami he's out at Doge because he's running for governor of Ohio. Good luck, Ohio [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1520.7s)]

*  He's dying to be an elected there's been a ton of leaks out of the Doge people that this guy they don't like him [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1548.98s)]
*  That is also B team the whole time. Yeah, and also he was telling ya [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1553.34s)]
*  Well, I'm sure the people is also begging to wine to make him the senator. Yeah, that didn't work out either [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1555.66s)]
*  Ending all allegedly [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1560.6599999999999s)]
*  Ending all federal government DEI initiatives including in the military [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1563.46s)]
*  There was also an order saying in order to to bring down inflation [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1568.5s)]
*  It's a whole of government approach to bringing down inflation because that's how it works [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1572.7s)]
*  You just have to send a yo and then the inflation comes down inflation is quivering in its boots inflation is quivering in its boots [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1576.78s)]

*  What's just for show? [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1589.1s)]
*  What do you think Dan? I mean much of the immigration stuff is real like there are really horrible stories [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1591.54s)]
*  You're hearing right now from people who had [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1598.5s)]
*  Appointments with CBP people who are seeking us out of that appointments for 1 p.m [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1601.3799999999999s)]
*  Today we had them canceled at 1201 the app that the Biden administration set up so that people could set up their appointments [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1604.82s)]
*  They shut that down at 1201 today [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1611.4599999999998s)]
*  the birthright citizenship is [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1614.6599999999999s)]
*  Potentially fake but maybe not like I mean most legal scholars believe you cannot the Constitution is pretty clear on this and you cannot declare it [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1617.5800000000002s)]
*  But the Trump administration can start thinking about it in that way and up until it gets goes through the court system [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1624.8600000000001s)]
*  The people can be affected by it a lot of this stuff is all as you point out [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1630.22s)]
*  It's just it's like Trump creates this fake reality [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1633.9s)]
*  And then he creates a series of fake solutions to solve the fake problems from the fake reality like the the electric vehicle mandate [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1636.18s)]
*  Just declaring the government will stop censorship will stop censoring things all of that is really fake [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1641.98s)]
*  But the immigration ones I think are quite real Trump says it's liberation day, and then you look at this [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1646.8s)]
*  Swath of Eos and yes, there's sort of these fake censorship ones, but for the most part [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1652.86s)]
*  There's nothing you weren't free to do yesterday that you're free to do today. There's nothing [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1658.02s)]
*  I know I love to see the list of things that Trump MAGA people [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1661.96s)]
*  Would like to be free to do that they're not currently able to do under the under the yoke of Joe Biden [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1664.86s)]
*  And so really what liberation day and by a Trump shit coin and a Melania shit coin, right? [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1670.42s)]
*  But you those are for sale before Trump even took office, but but it's more that like well, what does it really mean? [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1675.46s)]
*  What does liberation day mean? It means you get to watch on television all the people Trump has said are your enemies finally get there, too [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1681.02s)]
*  It's sort of a it's like you're it [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1687.3400000000001s)]
*  You're nothing good is happening to you. Nothing better is happening for you. You're not free to do anything different [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1689.66s)]
*  It's that Trump is targeting the enemies [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1694.42s)]
*  He's promised he was gonna target and that gives you a wonderful I guess [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1696.36s)]
*  Liberated feeling yeah, you could have saved a lot of time by just signing one EO on liberal tears [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1700.56s)]
*  Just right. Yeah, just watch the libs cry can't spell liberation day without lib. That's right [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1705.6799999999998s)]
*  That's right. You can't I'm saying can't spell a lot of things [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1710.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I do. I don't I mean [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1713.76s)]
*  Like the doge thing [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1716.36s)]
*  I know they're trying to do like shock and awe like a ton of executive orders a lot of the birthright citizenship [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1717.8s)]
*  I do even conservative legal scholars don't think this stands a chance. It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1724.34s)]
*  It's ridiculous very the 14th amendment is very clear [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1730.02s)]
*  And the only reason we're even entertaining it is because the Supreme Court has lost its mind [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1732.58s)]
*  But it is a ridiculous it is it is completely blitheringly obvious that this does not make sense that birthright citizenship is not [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1736.1s)]
*  Something the president can eliminate with the stroke of a pen the 14th amendment is crystal clear. Yeah [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1743.3s)]
*  I mean who knows because it's the supreme the supreme court they can always surprise you [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1747.2199999999998s)]
*  But I'm watching more like what do we get three votes for this do we get two votes for this? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1752.5s)]
*  Do we get one vote for this? Like I don't think Roberts goes with this [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1758.4199999999998s)]
*  I don't think Barrett and Kavanaugh go with this but Alito Gorsuch and Thomas you never know and who knows maybe maybe [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1761.5s)]
*  We also we also thought this on the fucking criminal immunity case [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1767.62s)]
*  And got surprised there. So who knows but it seems this one is pretty clear [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1771.6599999999999s)]
*  Kevin I was there today and was looking rough. I think he and Hegseth had a night [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1777.16s)]
*  That's a joke could have been a night of just dancing revelry fell a chair might have danced a lot [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1783.92s)]
*  Trump did not mention the tick-tock ban in his speech [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1790.84s)]
*  But he previously said he would sign an executive order delaying enforcement of the law banning it in the US [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1793.6s)]
*  This after tick-tock users spent the weekend with access only to messages from the app praising President Trump [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1799.24s)]
*  Even though he wasn't president yet for his valiant efforts to save the service [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1805.0600000000002s)]
*  Trump truthed [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1809.3000000000002s)]
*  Save tick-tock. Of course, he was once for the ban now. He's trying to save it then tick-tocks now back for people [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1811.94s)]
*  It's it's all in limbo right now [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1818.9s)]
*  but basically the law says you it gives the president the authority to [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1821.5400000000002s)]
*  Delay the implementation of the ban by 60 or 90 days if there is a potential deal in the offing [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1827.5s)]
*  It doesn't seem like there is a potential deal, but it seems like they're just going with us [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1833.58s)]
*  Anyway, the Biden administration had said in their final days [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1836.9399999999998s)]
*  We're not going to enforce the law so tick-tock can can remain operational. Which is a cool by the way cool [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1841.1799999999998s)]
*  Right, like great and then tick-tock being like we don't want Biden to say that we can be [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1847.62s)]
*  Operational and not get people's attention. So we're gonna do a stunt and shut down and it worked [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1853.9399999999998s)]
*  Because everyone then it got everyone's attention everyone in tick-tock who had been paying attention about that [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1859.5s)]
*  What do we think about this this the Trump being the savior of tick-tock Dan? I know you wrote a you wrote a box on this [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1864.98s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't think this is gonna be the thing that defines his presidency [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1870.82s)]
*  But we can talk about the national security concerns we can talk about the dangers of tick-tock but from pure politics [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1874.3s)]
*  He played it exactly right and I think I do think the Democrats and so to tick-tock and the many Republican and Democratic [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1879.46s)]
*  Lobbyists they hired and have been working full-time for them [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1886.5s)]
*  I mean, it's really not that complicated that if you are we're doing pure politics here [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1889.54s)]
*  Yeah [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1894.3799999999999s)]
*  that if you're gonna take something of tremendous value from six and ten voters under 30 and [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1894.6599999999999s)]
*  Then you never talk about why that should happen from the moment you pass the law in the dark of night until the day it disappears [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1899.4199999999998s)]
*  Like no one ever made the case for it [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1906.3799999999999s)]
*  You know Biden could have tried to make a public show as Trump did in the first administration of trying to facilitate [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1908.62s)]
*  A deal it's like they all passed this thing. They passed it without really thinking about it. They didn't sell it [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1914.62s)]
*  They didn't make a case for it and Trump understood right away. I mean for entirely [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1920.24s)]
*  cynical ridiculous reasons [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1925.46s)]
*  we understood the politics of it because at the time a lot of these Democrats voted for it and then Republicans to because your choice was [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1926.86s)]
*  Anger the youths or look soft on China and they defaulted to what was always theoretically better politics being tough on China and [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1933.78s)]
*  There's just a real difference between taking something that matters a lot to a group of people like you and I use the example with you [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1941.66s)]
*  on Friday [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1946.9s)]
*  for [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1948.0200000000002s)]
*  Voters of a certain age taking my tiktok is like taking away cable TV from us in our 20s [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1949.26s)]
*  Like it just disappears one day and that is all taking something away from someone's always gonna be worse politics than [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1954.3000000000002s)]
*  Generically being tough or soft on another country in a way that doesn't really affect people and so I mean from a political perspective [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1959.6200000000001s)]
*  Trump did very well here. This is he got a the probably the [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1966.18s)]
*  Most expensive free ad in American history to have a you know push notifications [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1970.6200000000001s)]
*  That's 170 million Americans first begging you to save the app and then crediting you for saving it all within a 12-hour period [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1974.7s)]
*  It's like yeah profoundly frustrating 24 hours [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1982.1000000000001s)]
*  I mean I thought Dan's piece on this in message box his newsletter which you all should subscribe to was excellent Tommy [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1985.98s)]
*  There was lots of less thoughtful commentary on Twitter about how once again Dems suck in [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1991.5s)]
*  Republicans rule because we give to Trump this political win [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1996.74s)]
*  And I just wish and while that is true we the politics of this did not end well for Joe Biden or the Democratic Party [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=1999.98s)]
*  I wish people were pointing out though that the vote in the house [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2006.82s)]
*  To ban was 360 to 58 so like 186 Republicans voted for banning this for banning tiktok or divesting tiktok [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2010.9s)]
*  It was 79 18 in the Senate. So you had 31 Republicans in the set. This is a [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2018.98s)]
*  overwhelming bipartisan [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2024.1s)]
*  decision [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2026.02s)]
*  The reason they did it was national security concerns, which they've done an absolutely terrible job explaining to anyone [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2027.3s)]
*  So no one understands why this happened [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2033.76s)]
*  but I also think part of the story of how Trump went from [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2035.8s)]
*  Wanting to ban tiktok and trying to do it on his way out the door to getting to saving tiktok is also that he met [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2039.7s)]
*  With a big donor named Jeff. Yes, or Jeff Yas [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2045.26s)]
*  Who said something to him that led him to flip-flop on this issue? [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2047.86s)]
*  And I think Jeff Yas owns 15% of ByteDance the parent company of tiktok [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2051.7s)]
*  So there was a big money angle here and then you know, tiktok wasn't shut down. They shut themselves down [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2055.98s)]
*  Preemptively so they could put up this little please save us. Mr [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2062.2599999999998s)]
*  Trump that they shouted from their tall tower and then they gave him the win and they're like, oh mr [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2065.8599999999997s)]
*  Trump saved us to suck up to the incoming administration [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2070.3399999999997s)]
*  so it was like it was so obviously a stunt and people were like [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2073.2599999999998s)]
*  The the commentary on Twitter particular was just so fucking credulous [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2077.02s)]
*  There's I think that they I don't even think it's I mean, I'm sure there could be a money angle to it [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2080.82s)]
*  But like I'm sure Kellyanne Conway like talked to Donald Trump and was like [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2085.42s)]
*  Hey [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2089.98s)]
*  One of the reasons you won is because a tiktok and they love you on tiktok now and tiktok is a great place to get [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2090.54s)]
*  Your message out and he's like really what's a tiktok and they're like, well, here it is and he's like, you know what? [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2095.46s)]
*  Sure. Yeah, I'm into it now [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2099.54s)]
*  Yeah, probably but Jeff Yas bought like a ton of shares of truth social [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2101.46s)]
*  Yeah at the time and like put a bunch of money into the Trump team's pocket [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2106.42s)]
*  So I think it could be a why not both situation [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2110.62s)]
*  I mean my like it really is to me is like just the as Joe Biden goes out the door [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2112.94s)]
*  It's like just these three big problems one of them being that like the reason they did this was never communicated and Joe Biden could never [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2118.06s)]

*  So it was on the dais [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2240.88s)]
*  So there was a time when people had a certain amount of dignity where you might not if you lead a company [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2241.84s)]

*  Which is not a really brilliant idea to come up with but again, they have had [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2280.48s)]
*  Republican and Democratic consultants lobbyists. They're all worse [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2284.7400000000002s)]

*  Just say thank you Donald Trump [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2296.54s)]
*  so then the third piece of it though the third piece of it which is I think about like the difference between what it is [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2298.34s)]
*  like to be a Democrat online versus a Republican online is [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2302.54s)]
*  when Democrats do something bad or [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2306.6200000000003s)]
*  Republicans criticize Democrats when they when they achieve something when Democrats achieve something [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2311.1000000000004s)]
*  Republicans attack Democrats when a bipartisan bill like this happens, right the the the online left attacks [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2315.82s)]
*  Democrats and it's not oh, this is actually Donald Trump. There's no one making that argument [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2323.34s)]
*  It's a bunch of people declaring this is why Democrats are terrible. This is why Democrats are terrible and I agree [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2327.6200000000003s)]
*  They're terrible, but if we want like I like I agree with all of that [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2332.42s)]
*  But like so much of the time that you see these two things side-by-side [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2335.7000000000003s)]
*  Which is how do Republicans get away with this stuff, right? How do they do it? [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2338.2200000000003s)]
*  How do they do it? [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2342.1800000000003s)]
*  And then you look at our media and it's a bunch of people that are much more interested in being part of the discourse of strategy [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2342.86s)]
*  Then actually doing the attacking right? [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2349.1s)]
*  There's a lot of people saying oh [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2351.1s)]
*  Donald Trump's gonna get credit for this as opposed to a bunch of people saying Donald Trump doesn't deserve credit for it [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2352.54s)]
*  And here's why right? [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2357.02s)]
*  Like we don't have there's like Republicans have so many more soldiers in the social media wars than we do we have analysts and we [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2358.1s)]
*  Have observers and and like if you want to talk about how Donald Trump managed to change politics so much over the last eight years [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2364.62s)]
*  And how things are possible now that weren't possible for it was that slow and steady work of those people [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2370.74s)]
*  Making acceptable things that weren't acceptable. We just don't have those people fixed bayonets. Love it. Yeah, so [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2376.42s)]
*  Internet social listen. Yeah, I think I will I'm ready. I [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2382.14s)]
*  To [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2385.7s)]
*  Digitally, it's actually Steve Bannon thing. You always is we're fixed bayonets. We're going after the lingo [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2386.9s)]
*  But I'm also somewhat like I'm in complete agreement with [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2391.54s)]
*  Dan's message box that the politics are what they are for Democrats and also I'm for the ban [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2394.14s)]
*  I think the ban is a good idea. I think that I think that having the CCP control [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2398.86s)]
*  One of the largest media platforms that 170 million people in the United States are on [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2404.1s)]
*  That is like melting their fucking brains our brains [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2408.58s)]

*  The the broader context is the Chinese have hacked into basically every single telecom company in the United States [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2425.34s)]
*  We've been unable the United States government's been unable to get them out [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2431.22s)]
*  We've learned over time that this op that's called salt typhoon [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2434.22s)]
*  They've managed to get audio and text messages of calls from Donald Trump JD Vance senior political officials [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2437.2999999999997s)]
*  So there's this ongoing hacking war happening and the idea that the Chinese National Security State wouldn't use [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2442.8599999999997s)]

*  Collecting the content of private messages on tik-tok [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2458.14s)]
*  It is also collecting the email and contact info of anyone in your contacts if you're using tik-tok and [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2461.3s)]
*  Their emails to send out the Chinese government when they want to can have the names [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2469.1000000000004s)]
*  Location data like what you're buying email of every single American so like again, maybe you're fine with that [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2474.5s)]
*  But it's also a legitimate [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2480.6600000000003s)]
*  Concern to address right but this to me is so I this is the problem, right? [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2483.5400000000004s)]
*  And all of that would be okay if it were in the hands of an American and to me like [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2488.14s)]
*  That what I take away from this where a nation that's why we have borders [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2492.98s)]
*  Right, but if we're talking about it, yes, it is worse when China does it right? [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2497.3399999999997s)]
*  But we have accepted an incredible level of invasion by these companies, which also should not be allowed [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2501.66s)]
*  What I like we went through a cycle of this with Facebook [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2506.98s)]
*  in 2016 and then out and then [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2510.7799999999997s)]
*  Elon Musk Twitter and how that's changed and misinformation on tik-tok and whether it's [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2515.06s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk or the Russians or the Chinese communist? [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2521.02s)]
*  What all these people have learned is that like if you throw a bunch of? [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2526.3399999999997s)]
*  throwing stars and numchucks and [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2531.42s)]
*  Bayonets and knives into the center of a digital circle Americans will pick them up and kill each other with them [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2534.22s)]
*  and [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2539.2599999999998s)]
*  That to me is still the problem right and so like I like whether people go from tik-tok to fucking reals like I don't [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2540.06s)]
*  like that this like [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2546.5s)]
*  The problem the law remains the law right Donald Trump's allowed to extend it [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2548.02s)]
*  But they have to put it in other people's hands [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2552.2999999999997s)]
*  But like the problem of misinformation and the way in which these technologies are fucking terrible for us continues [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2554.18s)]
*  And by the way, you know, no one has Joe Biden to kick around anymore and the people who are now [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2559.9s)]

*  You're buying nothing because you like the thing [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2908.3s)]

*  You can see the value go way up [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2926.14s)]
*  And if you bought a million of them for one cent and it goes to a dollar you make a ton of money [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2927.66s)]

*  That's what seems to have happened here. They're a company [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2934.22s)]
*  Connected to Trump owns 80% of these Trump coins. They also get a fee on the sale of these coins [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2938.14s)]
*  I saw a guy named Connor Grogan who is a director of Coinbase [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2944.78s)]
*  Estimated on Saturday that Trump's team had made 58 million in fees from all of the Trump coin sales [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2948.6800000000003s)]

*  And then they launched the Melania coin [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2962.34s)]
*  And it seems like a bunch of people saw that happen and maybe they sold their Trump coin to buy Melania coin [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2964.34s)]
*  They had one of each, you know [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=2970.0600000000004s)]

*  one [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3233.16s)]
*  She's getting a different something from Donald Trump right by major that too [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3235.68s)]
*  What'd you guys think of the last minute pardons I like the ones for the people that tried to protect democracy [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3241.12s)]
*  I'm confused by the ones for his family members. I know there are people that I didn't even know they were on Donald Trump's radar [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3246.32s)]
*  I think cash pretzel is gonna find out some about these people existing via these pardon. What did you think Dan? [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3251.64s)]

*  It's hard to the Republican Congress. So I think if you're doing that, I guess you're doing the whole family to make next year's Thanksgiving less awkward [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3261.92s)]
*  Do you think those are the stocking or something? How do you give these out? [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3268.16s)]
*  Stocking stuffer. It was one of those things that you pull it and it [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3272.36s)]
*  The [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3275.72s)]
*  Gender reveal yeah, the preemptive pardons fine [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3277.72s)]
*  Right. I mean, I think it's weird. He didn't do Jack Smith. Yeah, I know why I know why he didn't do Merrick Garland [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3281.68s)]
*  Well, maybe he shouldn't prosecuted by the Sun right? Yeah, but like a lot or just like everyone who was involved in investigating Donald Trump judge Mershon [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3286.68s)]
*  Cassidy Hutchinson. Did she get one? [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3295.16s)]
*  That's a good question. I don't think so. I don't know if they said not the witness [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3297.9199999999996s)]
*  I think the witness is something they did for the Capitol police officers that testified right? [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3300.68s)]
*  So I don't know about Cassidy. I mean I would like to be I would love a little more specificity if I were her [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3304.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's very true [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3309.4s)]
*  I think the people who got it know like there are names out there [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3310.92s)]
*  I think with them people in DOJ people like Alvin Bragg with tish James like all those [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3313.96s)]
*  Line somewhere, you know, he should have put something up by the auditorium [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3320.36s)]
*  Like like everyone's finding out if they made cheer squad. Oh, yeah [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3324.4s)]
*  Yeah, what do you open the things like commutation? Come on [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3328.7999999999997s)]
*  So much better but like back to Cassidy Hutchinson, I mean, I don't know her she's been on the show [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3332.48s)]
*  She was a witness. She was someone that Republicans accused of committing perjury [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3337.36s)]
*  before the committee and [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3342.4s)]
*  Also someone who was at the lowest level right? She was an assistant in the White House has no resources [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3344.72s)]
*  Is not gonna be able to hire like the fanciest lawyers out there. So I would be a little nervous if I were I will just say because [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3350.7999999999997s)]
*  In trying Trump called her out at his overflow speech. Yeah, he did he went after basically by name [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3358.12s)]
*  I will just say though that when we when he did the hunter pardon [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3362.84s)]
*  I said then that if he does the preemptive pardons, it will at least put the hunter pardon in a better light [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3367.94s)]
*  I still disagree with it, but I am good for Joe Biden [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3375.34s)]
*  I think the preemptive pardons it is sad that he has to do preemptive pardons for a bunch of people who committed no crimes [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3378.4s)]
*  But when you have a person who just became president who literally almost every day of his campaign [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3385.0s)]
*  Threatened to prosecute people for no reason because he was mad that he was being investigated for his lawbreaking [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3390.48s)]
*  Then you know, I would have I probably would have done the same thing. Oh [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3397.48s)]
*  like [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3402.2s)]
*  It's a it's an umbrella if [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3404.3199999999997s)]
*  Better to need it and not have better to have it not need it than need it not have it [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3406.68s)]
*  It clearly annoyed Donald Trump and we'll get to that speech, but you know, Donald Trump is pissed about these pardons [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3410.54s)]
*  Yeah, it is. It's just of a strange [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3415.74s)]
*  List and it is funny to also throw in your whole family. It's gonna do the hunter one in advance [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3418.02s)]
*  It though I mean just it's the other thing is like they released him at like 1158 [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3422.92s)]
*  like as his final act was to release Leonard Peltier from prison to [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3427.1s)]
*  pardon the [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3432.62s)]
*  pardon Jerry Lundgren a who was in prison for who's a [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3434.02s)]
*  Kentucky politician who's in prison for campaign finance violations and his whole family like it [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3437.7000000000003s)]
*  Doing it like in the sort of dark of night like that just makes it seem worse [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3443.86s)]
*  Yeah, just do it do it all and this is it's it's the same thing with the hunter Biden partner [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3448.7400000000002s)]
*  It's just like do this do them and defend them make the case for every personal political decisions [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3453.34s)]
*  Joe Biden makes he tends to make [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3458.6200000000003s)]
*  only with his family and like one or two aides and then just roll it out right away and it creates a political nightmare, right? [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3460.3s)]
*  I mean, this is the [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3465.98s)]
*  Family influence has its fingerprints all over this one, right? [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3468.1s)]
*  I mean, there's all this reporting about how he decided to run for reelection without really running it by staff [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3470.7400000000002s)]
*  Clearly there's reporting that the hunter pardon was made in concert with you know [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3477.02s)]
*  It's like a family meeting and then they kind of rolled it out [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3481.1s)]
*  Weeks and weeks ago and then did the rest of them this week. So yeah, I mean I think the the [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3483.46s)]
*  Timing the communications plan wasn't really there. Well for a lot of these [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3488.38s)]
*  I do think it's gonna really hurt Joe Biden's reelection chances [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3492.46s)]
*  But the it hurt like how he was talked about for months [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3494.82s)]
*  He could have put heart punter in this last batch and buried it all I guess there was kind of the questioning [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3497.82s)]
*  issue of sentencing the complicated things timing wise I [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3503.7400000000002s)]
*  Guess I know I know and I still don't get that because it's like say hunter was sentenced [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3507.94s)]
*  Then the silver pardon is the pardon or the commutation the computation, you know, the Leonard Pell C. A1 is interesting though [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3511.78s)]
*  He's a Native American activist who's been in jail since 1977 for allegedly murdering two FBI agents [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3516.1000000000004s)]
*  But it's been very controversial and I think [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3522.54s)]
*  You know people have been trying to get him released for years and years and years now [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3525.26s)]
*  I mean the Amnesty International called him a political prisoner, etc [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3529.42s)]
*  And I think he's not completely free to think he's now on a home confinement and moved into home confinement [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3533.1400000000003s)]
*  I'm glad Fauci got one. Yeah, our boy Fauci can rest easy [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3537.38s)]
*  Yeah [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3541.3s)]
*  but also like there's this [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3541.7400000000002s)]
*  Presumption of guilt and you see shitty people like Rand Paul tweeting about how now we know [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3543.2200000000003s)]
*  Fauci is guilty for his actions during the pandemic and maybe that maybe who cares I don't care about the only reason this matters is [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3548.8199999999997s)]
*  Chip Roy was out of the gate saying okay. Well now that they're all pardoned [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3556.58s)]
*  we can haul them all before Congress and they can't take the fifth and [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3560.06s)]
*  So either they tell us the truth or they lie and then we can get them on perjury [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3563.94s)]
*  Well, look the part the joke we can't stop the fact that they've taken over the government [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3570.22s)]
*  Can't stop them from abusing their offices on a going-forward basis [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3574.86s)]
*  But and and we can't stop them from in bad faith interpreting this however [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3579.46s)]
*  They want but I think I would rather have I would rather have a pardon in my hand and Rand Paul yelling at me [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3583.2200000000003s)]
*  Than neither I think you know what else we can't do [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3589.2000000000003s)]
*  Fake declare a new amendment to the Constitution. No now now now Jonathan [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3592.1400000000003s)]
*  You can you go outside and you say I declare the Equal Rights Amendment is the law of the land [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3598.42s)]
*  This happened on Friday Biden declared that the Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution was now the law of the land [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3603.42s)]
*  Even though basically no one else agrees love it. You want to unpack this one for us? So [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3609.6200000000003s)]
*  The Equal Rights Amendment the original draft had a deadline. I believe of 1977. It was extended to [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3614.42s)]
*  1982 [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3622.2200000000003s)]
*  It was passed by almost enough states to become a constitution amendment. It was won away [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3623.38s)]
*  Then in the years that followed several states rescinded their ratification and then Virginia became [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3629.14s)]
*  No take backs of it and then Virginia became the 37th state to ratify the eRA and [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3636.2599999999998s)]
*  There was a movement to say that Congress [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3642.46s)]
*  Setting a deadline is not constitutional because the Constitution doesn't make any provision for deadlines for ratification of amendments [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3646.54s)]
*  and therefore that part of the amendment doesn't matter and [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3653.8199999999997s)]
*  The National Archivist who is somehow for whatever reason very important in this process should declare it part of the Constitution [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3657.5s)]
*  They said no that she prints all the pocket Constitution. So [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3664.42s)]
*  Right. Yeah, and the big ones and the big ones and the big ones got all of them all sizes. Yeah [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3668.78s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah, you can do get all this. Yeah, you just do a PDF [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3673.84s)]
*  Biden could have ordered her to do it and he did not well, right? [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3677.46s)]
*  he could have ordered her to do it was not clear then it was not clear what happens after that and [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3680.0s)]
*  It would then end up before the Supreme Court the court has found that setting deadlines is a reasonable thing to do under the Constitution [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3685.36s)]
*  at the heavy right to [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3692.4s)]
*  Do it it does like to me like what I was comparing it to is like, okay [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3694.84s)]
*  so Joe Biden is doing this kind of vaguely extra legal thing on his way out the door and [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3698.1600000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump is doing this extra legal thing coming into the door of declaring that [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3702.6000000000004s)]
*  undocumented the children of undocumented immigrants are not citizens and it's just I [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3706.44s)]
*  Feel like we were like, you know, Joe Biden is the institution guy [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3709.72s)]
*  And there's a bunch of critiques of Joe Biden from the left saying he defends the institution [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3712.72s)]
*  But he should use his power and he should go further and then he does something like this and it's like he does it and the [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3716.64s)]
*  Archivist says no and then he's out of office and it's fucking dead and it just felt like a strange [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3721.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't know like kind of statement of principle or a fuck you out the door. It didn't lead to anything. It was purely [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3726.48s)]
*  Ceremonial it was very strange [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3735.2s)]
*  The substantive case for [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3737.3599999999997s)]
*  Trying to weigh in on this let's say would be that [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3739.8799999999997s)]
*  the supporters of [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3743.8799999999997s)]
*  The view that the amendment has been ratified say that that the president [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3745.8799999999997s)]
*  Putting his weight behind it lends some credence to the legal case. Should it go before the courts, right now? [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3751.12s)]
*  Fine, but in that case [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3758.8399999999997s)]
*  Maybe Joe Biden goes up and gives a statement that says like while I I don't know what to do [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3761.12s)]
*  I believe it is and and actually explains this what made it sort of [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3764.88s)]
*  mocked [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3769.96s)]
*  What led to it being mocked is you know, just like a graphic that he tweeted that is like I declare the amendment is the [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3771.48s)]
*  Declared bankruptcy once again the way they went about it was just sort of like what? [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3780.4s)]
*  It was it was very typical [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3786.12s)]
*  It's like enough to please the groups who are who've been pushing very hard for the amendment [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3787.84s)]
*  Groups who are who've been pushing very hard for the White House to do this but not enough to actually [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3792.8s)]
*  Go all the way like yeah [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3798.4s)]
*  Let's say he had ordered the archivist to do it and the archivist had printed a bunch of [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3799.6800000000003s)]
*  New constitutions with more amendments before you go out the door one [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3803.36s)]
*  Those would be worth a lot of money when it's eventually struck down. I mean cool [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3806.48s)]
*  It's just it was pure symbolism, right to and with no also with no other communications plan around it [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3809.1600000000003s)]
*  Why they did it why they couldn't do what was going on just nothing right off or by all the alternative by the way [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3817.28s)]
*  He's right the other door. He orders the National Archivist to print to do it. The archivist is like no [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3822.12s)]
*  And then where then where are we? [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3827.44s)]
*  Beaten up on Joe Biden as he goes out the door that this was a weird thing to do [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3829.8399999999997s)]
*  It's like this is a good lesson for the future for Democrats. Don't do shit like that [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3833.88s)]
*  Don't just declare stuff because like you it's [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3839.44s)]
*  symbolism [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3843.2799999999997s)]
*  Performance of stuff like it just doesn't doesn't matter [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3844.2799999999997s)]
*  What matters is like explaining to people why you can do something and then actually getting the power to do it whether it's the [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3847.72s)]
*  Pardons whether it's tick-tock whether it's this we have paid so last time I'm gonna say it for a while [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3853.64s)]
*  we have paid so dearly for having an empty bully pulpit for a long time and [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3858.52s)]
*  That is the that is the sad end to the Joe Biden presidency despite a lot of good that he did [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3864.2s)]
*  Well poor Phyllis Shafley [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3871.12s)]
*  You should everyone should listen to strict scrutiny this week they go deeper on this was very interesting speaking of someone who really knows how [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3873.12s)]
*  To command the bully pulpit Donald Trump even though he gave the longest inaugural address in modern history decided [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3878.8399999999997s)]
*  He was not done yet went to the overflow room and spoke to that crowd in Emancipation Hall [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3885.96s)]
*  33 minutes and basically it was like it was the it was the directors cut [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3893.68s)]
*  From the inaugural address all the things he wanted to say is the drunk DVD commentary exactly all the things he wanted to say [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3900.44s)]
*  But couldn't say in the speech. Let's listen and between JD and Melania and [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3908.0s)]
*  Anybody else that her police sir. It's such a beautiful unifying speech. Please sir. Don't say these things [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3914.6s)]
*  I was going to talk about the j6 hostages [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3921.28s)]
*  But you'll be happy [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3926.68s)]
*  Because you know, it's action not words that count [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3928.68s)]
*  And I was going to talk about the things that Joe did today with the pardons of people that were [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3932.24s)]
*  Very very guilty of very bad crimes. Why are we doing Millie? He was pardoned what he said [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3939.48s)]
*  Terrible what he said. Why are we helping some of the people? [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3945.68s)]
*  Why are we helping Liz Cheney? I mean Liz Cheney is a disaster. She's a crying lunatic and crying [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3949.56s)]
*  Crying Adam Kinzinger, he's a super crying. I never saw the guy not crying [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3956.3199999999997s)]
*  He's always crying and I think this was a better speech than the one I made up stands [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3960.36s)]
*  It certainly was a [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3970.12s)]
*  Truer speech to who Trump is. Yeah, this is that sort of the moment. I think we all we all heard this was going on [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3972.56s)]
*  We're like, this is this is the next four years. This is what we're in for. Yeah, it's a rally speech [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3978.12s)]
*  one after the other [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3983.3199999999997s)]
*  Did you catch that Dan? Did you catch the the overflow speech? I did and it's exactly exactly you described it, right? [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3985.08s)]
*  It is the director's cut. It's just and this I mean [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3991.04s)]
*  it's just like sometimes I can never stop looking at these things from perspective of [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3993.7999999999997s)]
*  Communications staffer, but you do this whole speech. This is your message you have I mean [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=3998.48s)]
*  it's poorly written but someone did write it and you have it out there and you've decided these are the things you're gonna do and [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4003.64s)]
*  then he just [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4008.24s)]
*  Calls Nancy Pelosi a criminal and talks about and calls Liz Cheney a crying psychopath [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4009.48s)]
*  Minutes after your speech is over. It's just it's like a truly wild choice. I also [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4015.6s)]
*  Everyone should go watch this just to see the look on JD Vance's face at the top before he starts talking about all the things [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4021.2400000000002s)]
*  He didn't want them [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4028.16s)]
*  He looks like so pained and kind of constipated and speaker Johnson is like [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4028.8s)]
*  Twitching and looking around and staring into the middle distance. It's it's well [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4033.6s)]
*  Well part of it also like this was supposed to be ten minutes and [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4037.88s)]
*  And so, you know, it's it's a little bit like they're like, okay [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4041.48s)]
*  So Trump's gonna be a little toast to say thank you to all the people in the overflow because we couldn't do this outside [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4044.28s)]
*  And then we'll go do the parade and and whatever other and the heinous executive order ceremonies and all the other things [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4048.08s)]
*  We've got big plans for the day. And so they're just standing behind him [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4053.1600000000003s)]
*  They wouldn't have stood behind him if he was gonna speak for 30 minutes [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4055.6600000000003s)]
*  So part of it is a sort of like can I shuffle to the fucking side here? I'm standing behind [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4057.92s)]
*  I'm supposed to be a greeting [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4061.76s)]
*  He's doing he's doing a tight 15 on how the border wall was gonna be made of cement [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4062.88s)]
*  But there's acid that goes through cement and I didn't think it was gonna be pretty. I thought it was gonna be ugly [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4067.0s)]
*  There's Greg Abbott. There's this guy. There's that guy and they're standing behind him and Melania and her big goofy fucking hat [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4070.56s)]
*  It's just hiding her eyes and looking down and it's the soap hiss the whole time and then Trump starts talking about how her feet hurt [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4075.92s)]
*  And how she wanted to go home, but he made her come here. It's so weird [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4082.08s)]
*  Yeah, and but it was like to Dan's point about the communications piece of it. He basically, you know [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4086.4s)]
*  Takes us all behind the scenes because he gets up there and he said these are the parts [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4092.04s)]
*  I really wanted to say but they told me I couldn't say today that I should save it for tomorrow [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4095.2s)]
*  But I'm not gonna save it for tomorrow. I'm gonna do it right here right now [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4100.0s)]
*  And and you know what he was right doesn't matter it. Well, that's his he said I was right [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4103.36s)]
*  He said I don't think it's gonna affect the coverage because they're the coverage of my main speech is already out there and it's looking [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4108.08s)]
*  Pretty good, but maybe I'll get in trouble. Well, you know what it will affect some of the coverage [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4112.96s)]
*  We're gonna talk about it [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4116.46s)]
*  MSNBC is probably flipping out about it New York Times will mention it right and then it won't fucking matter because most people [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4117.44s)]
*  That voted for him don't pay any attention to any of those media sources [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4124.5199999999995s)]
*  And so it's like they just pay attention to Donald Trump what Donald Trump says [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4128.719999999999s)]
*  So if he wants to do his fucking tight 33 on on his his stump speech revised one last time, you know [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4131.48s)]
*  That's that's what he's here for four years for right and I assume all the headlines even the mainstream headlines [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4138.099999999999s)]
*  That'll be slowly that people will catch and see disperses or things like America's decline are over America's golden age [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4142.88s)]
*  They are the headlines that Donald Trump would want it to be and by the way [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4149.44s)]
*  That's not a criticism of them when the president gives an inaugural the headline should be the headline line from the speech [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4152.2s)]
*  That is what it should be [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4156.72s)]
*  So, of course, he's free to fucking do this and by the way all of his he's gonna do all of his biggest fans are gonna [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4157.48s)]
*  See this they're all gonna see don't worry. The real Trump is still there. We're gonna get exactly what we want from this guy. Yeah [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4162.04s)]
*  Just to end Dan you you brought a message box on Monday today this morning. Is it Monday? [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4167.48s)]
*  We're recording this day is my day as you all know because we're talking about the inaugural [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4173.4s)]
*  But how to survive the Trump presidency? [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4177.16s)]
*  What are some highlights what are some tips for everyone on how to survive the Trump presidency and then we can ask [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4180.04s)]
*  Tommy and love it what they think too. I'll do a few and then for all of them subscribe but [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4185.0s)]
*  I think there are just a few things I would you know, I've is [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4193.04s)]
*  There are gonna be after today [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4196.96s)]
*  1460 more days of the Trump presidency and we got to get through all of them [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4200.24s)]
*  Right and we've got to try to get through them by states [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4203.48s)]
*  Let's get through them with our faculties intact and so just a couple things that I've been thinking about is one [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4205.68s)]
*  Yes, Trump won a really big victory [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4211.6s)]
*  Like he won as he pointed out in his inaugural dress. He won all the swing states the country did move to the right [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4214.04s)]
*  He did win the popular vote [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4219.240000000001s)]
*  But he also only won the presidency by about a hundred thousand votes in three states and that's just worth keeping in mind not to tell [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4220.400000000001s)]
*  Ourselves some story about how we don't make huge changes the Democratic Party. We absolutely do but just that [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4228.04s)]
*  Victory is that much is much closer than it appears right at this moment [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4233.320000000001s)]
*  Just like keep that in mind [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4237.8s)]
*  Second, I think this is a lesson we've all learned from the Trump years [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4239.96s)]
*  Now is we don't have to follow him down every rabbit hole. Mm-hmm, right? He wants our attention 24-7 [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4243.56s)]
*  he wants to just flood the zone with shit all the time and [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4248.72s)]
*  Our attention is our greatest resource and we can decide how we what where when we give it to Trump [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4252.4400000000005s)]
*  We can just depict between the things that actually [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4258.84s)]
*  Matter where he's making a real impact and the things is just so much a noise to distract us [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4262.2s)]
*  And so I think it's a very important thing. It's not something I'm gonna try to do with the newsletter [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4266.08s)]
*  I think it's something we can do this podcast is try to help people separate the signal from the noise understand what matters [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4269.08s)]
*  I think the most important thing is [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4273.360000000001s)]
*  We're all angry. We are anxious. We are [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4276.96s)]
*  Worried and the best thing to do and that's always been true ever since Trump was first elected to channel that into action and [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4280.8s)]
*  People should go to vote save America will [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4287.96s)]
*  to figure out ways to do that, but just I want to keep people like a North Star for this which is [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4289.96s)]
*  Right now the Republicans have won the narrowest House majorities in history [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4294.92s)]
*  you have a bunch of Republicans who are existing in very very purple districts the [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4297.6s)]
*  The voting patterns in the Trump era suggests we have a phenomenal chance to take the house back [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4303.2s)]
*  And if we take the house back Donald Trump will never pass another law that does not have a keem Jeffries [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4308.12s)]
*  Okay, we will have the ability to investigate Donald Trump we investigate the ability to hold hearings to issue subpoenas and [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4313.98s)]
*  We can do that and that is of just we have to get through these two years [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4320.98s)]
*  focused in working on taking the house back and [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4325.139999999999s)]
*  If we do that Trump will still be present [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4327.7s)]
*  He can still do really bad things [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4330.0199999999995s)]
*  But we will have so much more power to be able to live it what he does limit the damage [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4331.0599999999995s)]
*  He does and expose him for who he is. All right. I like that anyone else [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4334.54s)]
*  Watch what he does not what he says and focus on those midterms [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4339.5s)]
*  He said that in the in his speech. He said actions matter words more than words. There we go. I think that was right [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4343.42s)]
*  Yeah, he's a strong silent type this one. Yeah [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4348.82s)]
*  Just two thoughts one is [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4352.66s)]
*  Things change less than you think in a year and more than you think in five years [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4355.54s)]
*  And I think today to me was like a reminder of that [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4359.24s)]
*  We wonder like how did we get to a place where corruption doesn't matter? [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4362.26s)]
*  Like how did we get to a place where Donald Trump can abuse the office in this way? Well, it took time took a slow degradation of [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4365.86s)]
*  Basic values of the Republican Party being slowly and steadily corrupt co-opted, but it did change and changed a lot [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4372.26s)]
*  but it did it in a matter of just a few years and [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4378.820000000001s)]
*  We shouldn't be so cynical or apathetic or resigned to believe that it can't change just as much in the other direction [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4382.3s)]
*  In another couple of years [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4389.18s)]
*  We have to slowly work towards that in all the ways we can and that's a very big goal [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4391.16s)]
*  And then that's a hard goal and it's hard to think about and then when you when you when you get [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4394.66s)]
*  Anxious or bored or frustrated or mad about thinking about that big problem [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4398.46s)]
*  You can focus on the very concrete just winning the house. Yeah, I think you know, it's uh [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4402.9800000000005s)]
*  It's taking me 43 years to do this [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4408.06s)]
*  but I don't doom about the future as much anymore because not because there's nothing to doom about but because [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4409.74s)]
*  Nothing we can do like worrying about it. It's not gonna change it [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4416.54s)]
*  So really trying to take the Trump presidency one day at a time and focusing on like what we can control and what we can do [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4420.06s)]
*  What we can control and what we can't and also recognizing that to Dan's point [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4427.18s)]
*  You know, he won by a hundred thousand plus votes in in in all the swing states [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4431.58s)]
*  and we should also recognize though like why he won and it seems like the [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4436.14s)]
*  You know not the trump fans, but the additional people that got him over the I got him over the hill [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4441.1s)]
*  Um that got him over, you know, they got him close to 50% and won on the swing states [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4446.22s)]
*  They were pissed about the cost of living [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4450.38s)]
*  And they didn't think that the democratic party [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4452.860000000001s)]
*  Uh gave enough of a shit about them and you know right now price of eggs [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4455.66s)]
*  Four dollar and fifty four dollars and fifteen cents [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4461.72s)]
*  Uh for price of eggs mortgage rate is seven percent gas is three dollars a gallon [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4464.38s)]
*  So we're just gonna check back in on those because well, let's just take donald trump at his words [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4469.42s)]
*  Let's we've tried resistance politics. Let's try normal politics normal politics is he made a bunch of promises [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4474.38s)]
*  Big promises that he was going to do is going to fix the country. We're not going to decline [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4480.22s)]
*  Everything's going to be great. It's going to be affordable prices are going to fall. You're going to be doing great [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4483.0199999999995s)]
*  Okay, if that happens good for donald trump [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4487.66s)]
*  but if it doesn't happen if it doesn't happen we should point it out we should point it out along the way when he breaks his [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4489.74s)]
*  Promises or when he declines to fulfill them [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4494.54s)]
*  Yeah, there's a moment in the speech where he says that the country is unifying behind my agenda. It is not [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4497.98s)]
*  That is what he that is that is wish casting that is hopeful thinking [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4503.099999999999s)]
*  But uh the policies that are deeply unpopular a week ago remain deeply unpopular today [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4506.46s)]
*  No, the country doesn't want giant tax cuts [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4511.1s)]
*  For the rich. No, it doesn't want a president who's focused on [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4513.900000000001s)]
*  bathroom policies and and ridiculous right wing grievances over over their basic day-to-day concerns [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4518.22s)]
*  And we'll be here with you guys the whole time. We're not going anywhere [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKeuXV51zN4&t=4524.22s)]
