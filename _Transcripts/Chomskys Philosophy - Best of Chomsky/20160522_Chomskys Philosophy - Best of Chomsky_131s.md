# Noam Chomsky - Spencer vs. Kropotkin
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [May 22, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyC0sZ3rLz0)
*  Well, there is the social northerness view that Herb and Spencer is famous for developing,
*  that in a capitalist system, you know, it'll be nature and bread and blood and claw, the
*  strongest wind, and Goldman Sachs is given us an illustration, or maybe IBM and so on.
*  But they're not illustrations.
*  They are illustrations of how the nanny state, the powerful state that's run by the principal
*  architects of policy, designs policy in such a way as to enrich and privilege the designers.
*  What's that got to do with capitalism?
*  I mean, there's a kind of a capitalist fringe to it.
*  What about Herbert Spencer?
*  Well, at the same time, a little after Herbert Spencer, there was a response, much less known,
*  namely Kropotkin, a natural historian who wrote a book called Mutual Aid, a Factor in
*  Evolution, and he argued the exact opposite.
*  He argued that on Darwinian grounds, you would expect cooperation and mutual aid to
*  develop and leading towards community workers' control and so on.
*  Well, you know, he didn't prove his point.
*  It's at least as well argued as Herbert Spencer is.
*  But in fact, Kropotkin essentially founded what is now called sociobiology or evolutionary
*  But his contribution is sort of unmentionable because he came out with the wrong conclusions.
*  Well, nobody could give right conclusions.
*  Human nature probably has all of these factors in it.
*  But some of them are favorable to the interests of the rich and powerful.
*  So those do survive.
*  Here there is, if you like, a Spencerian element.
*  The ideological concoctions that are beneficial to the rich and powerful, they'll tend to
*  propagate.
*  The ones that are harmful to the interests of the rich and powerful will tend to be marginalized
*  and suppressed.
*  But that has nothing to do with the reality of the world.
*  That has to do with how power systems function.
