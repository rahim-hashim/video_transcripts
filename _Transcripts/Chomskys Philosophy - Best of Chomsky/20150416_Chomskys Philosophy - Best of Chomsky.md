# Noam Chomsky - The Turing Test
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [April 16, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F34PjaMKCn0)
*  The Turing test is fooled by algorithmic systems, or I believe you said something like that.
*  Well, how will we know when we do have an intelligent computer?
*  Talk to it longer?
*  No, we won't ever know whether we have an intelligent computer any more than we will
*  know whether we have an airplane that flies.
*  It's a meaningless question.
*  Exactly as Turing said.
*  Suppose I ask you this question.
*  Let's say we're back in 1908, or whatever the first right thing was.
*  Suppose somebody came along and said, suppose I make something that goes up in the air,
*  how are we going to know if it flies?
*  That's just a dumb question.
*  There's no question as to whether it's going to fly.
*  If you want to call that stuff flying, OK, it's flying.
*  In English you happen to decide to call it flying.
*  In some other language you call it something else.
*  But there is no empirical question as to whether an airplane flies.
*  And there is no empirical question as to whether an algorithm thinks, for exactly the same
*  reason.
*  Flying is something birds do, at least if you talk in English.
*  And thinking is something humans do.
*  It's sort of embedded in a big matrix of human interests.
*  And that's why it's called flying.
*  But the question, how do we know when we do have an intelligent computer?
*  And I think we have a very interesting question.
*  I don't want to go into it, but I think it's a very interesting one.
*  And I think it's a very interesting question.
*  I think it's a very interesting question.
*  I think it's a very interesting question.

*  Seeing triangles is a human action.
*  Seeing triangles is a human action.
*  We attribute that characterization to humans in a framework of human interests and concerns

*  This notion is of absolutely no use for science.
*  This notion is of absolutely no use for science.
*  I mean, we don't study in the sciences things like thinking any more than we study things
*  like desks in the sciences.
*  I mean, we don't study in the sciences things like thinking any more than we study things
*  like desks in the sciences.
*  I mean, these are concepts of common sense that belong in the sciences.
*  They don't enter into rational explanatory theories.
*  They don't enter into rational explanatory theories.
*  So in the sciences you're constantly trying to get rid of all these things.
*  So in the sciences you're constantly trying to get rid of all these things.
*  So in the sciences you're constantly trying to get rid of all these things.
*  You know, you look at what's actually happening, try to understand it in terms of whatever
*  concepts and principles are relevant.
*  But to ask the question whether a program thinks or whether a brain sees a triangle
*  is just a question of whether a program thinks or whether a brain sees a triangle is just
*  a question of whether a program thinks or whether a brain sees a triangle is just a
*  triangle is as dumb as asking whether an airplane flies. It is not going to have an answer for
*  trivial reasons. There is no answer to the question whether airplanes fly and there is
*  no point setting up an analog of the Turing test that says, well, can we construct something
*  that is going to fool a human under some circumstances. That won't tell us whether it is flying or
*  not.
*  But if you think, you think, I presume, and what if we make a machine with the attributes
*  like the human brain, very complicated.
*  Well, the human brain has attributes like the human brain, and the human brain doesn't
*  think.
*  Well, humans do, but human brains don't. Anywhere that your brain sees a triangle. Your brain
*  doesn't see a triangle for quite uninteresting reasons, and correspondingly, something with
*  the characteristics of your brain doesn't see a triangle. People are the ones who do
*  things like that, just as Turing said.
*  Now, you can ask pointless questions, like what will be the empirical conditions under
*  which an airplane flies. If you ask a pointless question, you are never going to get an answer,
*  Now, it is interesting that in the, you know, dealing with sort of phenomenal world, like
*  airplanes flying, nobody asks those silly questions. I mean, if somebody tried to start
*  a new science dealing with the question whether airplanes fly, they would be laughed out of,
*  you know, nobody would be bothered laughing.
*  Well, there really were standards for the human flight contest. There were some standards
*  that they had to fly a figure eight.
*  But you don't ask whether, see, you don't even ask whether humans can fly. Suppose somebody
*  came along and said, how do we know that humans can't fly? Take a look at the last Olympics.
*  Some guy went 30 feet. Why isn't that flying? You know, it's only one order of magnitude
*  less than chicken. That's just a dumb question. It has no answers. You know, it's a matter
*  of decision whether we want to call that flying or not.
