# Noam Chomsky on U.S. Foreign Policy
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [May 16, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Leay8-VGFM)
*  You asked us after September 11, one of your points is we ought to look in the mirror,
*  we being America or the West, we ought to look in the mirror at our own.
*  Was that a way of saying, look, people like Bin Laden are angry at us for good reason?
*  In other words, is there a way to justify it?
*  That's not what I was saying.
*  The statement of mine that you just quoted is a very conservative statement.
*  In fact, it was articulated by George Bush's favorite philosopher, Jesus Christ, who pointed
*  out famously, defined the notion hypocrite.
*  A hypocrite is a person who focuses on the other fellow's crimes and refuses to look
*  at his own.
*  That's the definition of hypocrite by George Bush's favorite philosopher.
*  When I repeat that, I'm not taking a radical position.
*  I'm taking a position which is just elementary morality.
*  But even if he is a hypocrite...
*  Not he, everyone.
*  Can you...
*  Another question.
*  See, here's an experiment.
*  Try to find a phrase in the massive commentary on September 11, which is not hypocritical
*  in the sense of George Bush's favorite philosopher.
*  Find one phrase.
*  I don't think you can do it.
*  Okay, but before I don't want to get gnostic here and religious on it, but I do want to...
*  This is not religion.
*  This is elementary morality.
*  If people cannot rise to the level of applying to ourselves the same standards we apply to
*  others, they have no right to talk about right and wrong or good and evil.
*  But let's talk about even in right.
*  And look, there's nobody pure, but an argument has been made.
*  I know that the U.S. has committed atrocities.
*  However, they did oust a more brutal regime than Taliban.
*  There was...
*  That wasn't even a war aim.
*  There wasn't even a war aim.
*  Wasn't even a war aim.
*  But is that a moral thing to do?
*  They did get rid of a brutal regime.
*  There was celebration in Canada.
*  Good, fine.
*  Let them bomb Israel and get rid of the brutal regime there.
*  Let them bomb Uzbekistan and get rid of the brutal regime there.
*  You say the Taliban and the Israeli government are the same?
*  No, they're not the same.
*  They're brutal regimes.
*  But let's go back a stage.
*  The goal was not to oust the Taliban.
*  That was not a war aim.
*  That was a war aim that was picked up several weeks after the bombing started.
*  Okay?
*  And let's go back.
*  Suppose that we...
*  And there are dozens of, like, list...
*  Long list of brutal regimes around the world, which ought to be overthrown, but not by somebody
*  bombing them.
*  However, let's go back to the late October, when the...
*  After three weeks of bombing, when the U.S. and its British client decided to shift the
*  war aims to overthrowing the Taliban regime.
*  There was a meeting sponsored by the United States in Peshawar, Pakistan, of a thousand
*  Afghan leaders.
*  They unanimously condemned the bombing and said it was undermining their efforts, which
*  they thought could succeed, to overthrow the Taliban regime from within.
*  The U.S. is doing it just to show off their muscle.
*  All right, now...
*  You want to...
*  So the question of whether to overthrow a regime, yeah, that arises.
*  And I think the Afghans are right.
*  Regimes should be overthrown from within, and in this case, it was probably very likely
*  that that would succeed.
*  It was a small, brutal group, highly unpopular, plenty of opposition to it, which could have
*  been organized from within, and that's the way to overthrow a regime.
*  If we want to overthrow the regime of Uzbekistan, now a great favorite, but it happens to be
*  now very different from the Taliban, the way to do it would not be to bomb Uzbekistan,
*  but to support internal democratic forces and let them do it.
*  And that generalizes around the world.
*  Now, Robert Kaplan, who writes about foreign policy, I spoke to him recently about his
*  book, Warrior Politics, and I put some of your points to him.
*  He said, about the distinction between the terrorist states that you call Israel, America,
*  and the terrorist states that America calls the Taliban.
*  He said, I wish Noam Chomsky had been with me in Romania in the 70s or the 80s, just
*  one of the seven or eight Warsaw states, with just one of the seven or eight prison
*  systems with 700,000 political prisoners.
*  Adult choice of foreign policy is made on distinctions.
*  The argument that Chomsky makes has no distinctions, because there's a difference between the quantity
*  and the kind of dictators that America supported and the quantity and the kind of things we
*  went in in communist world for 44 years.
*  So let's take his example of Romania, Ceausescu, a hideous regime, which he forgot to tell
*  the United States supported, supported right till the end, as did Britain.
*  So the example that he gave is a perfect example, and it's a small example, because we support
*  much more brutal regimes.
*  Suharto was one of the worst killers and torturers of the late 20th century.
*  The United States and Britain supported him throughout.
*  He's our kind of guy, as the Clinton administration said in 1995.
*  A horrible atrocity.
*  In fact, when he came into office in 1965 with a coup, the CIA compared it to Hitler,
*  Stalin and Mao.
*  It led to total euphoria in the United States and Britain, massive support.
*  When he carried out even worse atrocities, comparable atrocities elsewhere, hundreds
*  of thousands people killed then, hundreds of thousands later, full support continued
*  right through the end of his rule, in fact, continued past his rule.
*  In late 1999, when they were rampaging and destroying what was left of East Timor, the
*  U.S. and Britain continued to support him.
*  And I can continue through the world like this.
*  Well, Kaplan says that there is a distinction.
*  Everyone's got some blood on their hands, but he says, ah, we have significantly less
*  blood because what we are is a soft imperialist, not state terrorists.
*  So like when we supported his example, Ceausescu in Romania right to the end, that's good.
*  How about killing several million people in Vietnam?
*  How about killing hundreds of thousands of people in Central America in the 80s, leaving
*  four countries devastated beyond, you know, beyond, maybe beyond recovery?
*  To qualify the U.S. for intervening in any other way?
*  Look, nor does it disqualify Bin Laden.
*  The fact that Bin Laden is a terrorist or that, say, the Taliban are a terrorist state,
*  that fact doesn't disqualify them from bombing Washington.
*  What disqualifies from doing that is even if they were Mahatma Gandhi, they shouldn't
*  do it.
*  Kaplan's can't understand trivialities.
*  The triviality here is that nobody except the ultra-right-wing jingoists like Kaplan
*  is comparing atrocities by various countries.
*  What honest people are saying, this seems to be incomprehensible, is that we should
*  keep to the elementary moral level of the Gospels.
*  We should pay attention to our own crimes and stop committing them.
*  This would be true even if we were killing one person, okay?
*  And it's even more true when we're killing millions of people.
*  Let's bring it to the bigger picture.
*  The question, he says, we all agree with the Gospels.
*  He doesn't.
*  He certainly doesn't.
*  He says, look, I believe in a Hobbesian world.
*  This is what he says.
*  The world's Hobbesian is nasty.
*  If you leave people alone, they'll kill each other.
*  And that's why what you need, as he calls it, is an organizing hegemon, an overwhelming
*  power that sometimes...
*  Which is always us.
*  Which is always us, he says.
*  And why is it us?
*  Because we have the power.
*  And we have a massively subservient intellectual class, of which he's an illustration, which
*  will support U.S. atrocities no matter how awful they are.
*  But he says this is real politic, that Chomsky's off in another land with his Gospel, that
*  he says, look...
*  Forget Gospel.
*  I'm talking about the most elementary morality.
*  If a person doesn't understand that, they have no right to talk, okay?
*  If you don't understand that you pay attention to your own crimes, you have no right to talk.
*  He talks about Machiavellian virtue.
*  Sometimes we do a bad thing to protect our democratic and our good institutions and adjust
*  society.
*  Yes, but how are we protecting our democratic institutions by supporting mass slaughter
*  in southeastern Turkey in the last few years?
*  Was that supporting our democratic institutions?
*  Was it supporting...
*  Our democratic institutions?
*  Not ours, but...
*  Anybody?
*  Would Kaplan argue that the nation state has a right to use any means necessary to protect
*  its sovereignty?
*  Oh, then he's justifying Milosevic.
*  He's saying Milosevic had the right to do anything he wanted to repress the Kosovovars
*  in Albania.
*  Is that what he's saying?
*  Do we need a constabulary, a force, a central force, in this case it's America because it's
*  the superpower, to sometimes use unjust means in the service of just causes?
*  What are the just causes?
*  What was the just cause in, for example, slaughtering Kurds in southeastern Turkey?
*  What was the just cause?
*  What was the just cause in supporting Suharto when he killed a couple hundred thousand landless
*  peasants in Indonesia, went on to become one of the biggest torturers in the world, and
*  then destroyed, slaughtered a third of the population of East Timor?
*  What was the just cause?
*  What was the just cause when we invaded South Vietnam 40 years ago?
*  This is the 40th anniversary of the public announcement of the U.S. attack on South Vietnam,
*  ending up killing millions of people, leaving the country devastated, still dying from chemical
*  warfare.
*  What was the just cause?
*  What was the just cause when we fought a war, to a large extent, against the Catholic Church
*  in Central America in the 1980s, killing hundreds of thousands of people, every imaginable kind
*  of torture and devastation?
*  What was the just cause?
*  Can I continue?
*  Yeah, the just cause for people like Kaplan is, we did it, therefore it's a just cause.
*  You can read that in the Nazi archives too.
*  The Christian says we've seen the enemy, and the enemy isn't us, it's the Islamic fascists,
*  comparison to fascists.
*  They're an enemy.
*  We don't want to live with them, we don't want to negotiate them, we must destroy them,
*  ergo the war games.
*  The Taliban justified the war games, the Al Aqsa Brigades justified them, he has a different
*  distinction, but we see the face of the enemy and we should do anything to root them out.
*  How do you respond to that argument?
*  I respond to that by saying that there are many evil forces in the world.
*  If we want to stop atrocities, I think it's a great idea to reduce the level of atrocities
*  and violence around the world.
*  The easiest way to do it, simplest, is to stop participating in it.
*  If we stop participating in it, we will already reduce the level of atrocities and violence
*  enormously, and if we can ever reach the moral level, minimal moral level, of terminating
*  our own massive participation in atrocities, then we can move to another question of what
*  we do about the atrocities of others.
*  And I think it's right to deal with them.
*  Yes, there is an enemy.
*  There are people who carried out crimes against humanity, and there are ways to deal with
*  crimes, not by bombing another country and putting millions of people at the risk of
*  starvation.
*  That's not a way to deal with crimes.
*  When the U.S. was condemned for international terrorism in Nicaragua, and then vetoed a
*  security — and dismissed the condemnation by the world court, of course — and escalated
*  the crimes, and vetoed a Security Council resolution calling on it to observe international
*  law, the right reaction for Nicaragua was not to say, we have seen the enemy and we
*  must destroy them, so therefore let's set off bombs in Washington.
*  But if it's wrong for them, it's wrong for us.
*  Again, by elementary moral standards.
*  So we should ask, well, what was right for them, and what's right for — which would
*  be right for us.
*  And I think they couldn't do what was right for them because we blocked it.
*  We're too powerful.
*  But we could do what was right for them, and we never even considered it, because we don't
*  rise to that minimal moral level.
