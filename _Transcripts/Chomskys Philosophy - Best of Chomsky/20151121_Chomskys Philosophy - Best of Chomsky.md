# Noam Chomsky - How to Fight Terrorism?
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [November 21, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2-mCS_GEc)
*  Forgetting everything that's been said, rising to minimal levels of morality, let's try to
*  answer the question.
*  Well, we can start by asking how should a long series of countries around the world
*  react to Western state terrorism?
*  So to take, just take one uncontroversial case.
*  How should Nicaragua react to US terrorism against Nicaragua?
*  I mean, that case is uncontroversial because we have a world court decision and we would
*  have had a Security Council resolution accepted, the US vetoed it.
*  So it's uncontroversial and is much worse than September 11th.
*  Tens of thousands of people killed, the country practically destroyed, may never recover.
*  So how should Nicaragua have responded to US terror?
*  Well, one possibility is to bomb Washington.
*  Does anybody believe that's the way they should have responded?
*  Another might be, say, bioterror.
*  Another may be assassinate the president.
*  Anybody believe that that's a proper response?
*  I've never seen anybody believe it.
*  I certainly don't believe it.
*  Okay, but if we don't believe that that was a right response to our atrocities, then it's
*  not the right response to their atrocities.
*  Particularly when it's people who didn't even do it, like the people in Afghanistan
*  had nothing to do with this.
*  So the real question is, should Nicaragua have set off bombs in, I don't know, Oklahoma
*  or something?
*  It's ridiculous.
*  So therefore, the entire Western response, by Western standards, is totally illegitimate.
*  In fact, let's take contemporary terrorism.
*  There are plenty of it.
*  September 11th was a terrorist atrocity.
*  So is the reaction to it.
*  Literally, literally, by the literal meaning of the word terrorism as defined in US official
*  documents.
*  Terrorism is the calculated use, threat or use of violence to achieve political or other
*  ends through intimidation or fear.
*  Suppose you announce to people, we're going to continue to bomb you unless you turn over
*  to us people who we suspect of crimes, though we're not going to provide you with any evidence
*  and we're going to refuse negotiations.
*  I'm quoting George Bush.
*  In the literal sense, extreme terrorism.
*  Or let's go on a couple of weeks later, a few weeks later, end of October, the US and
*  Britain changed their war aims.
*  They shifted it to overthrowing the regime.
*  So Admiral Boyce, the British Minister of Defense, announced to the people of Afghanistan,
*  we are going to, you have to understand that we're going to continue to bomb you until
*  you get your leadership changed.
*  Textbook illustration of terrorism.
*  Okay, what's the right response?
*  Is it to assassinate Bush and Boyce?
*  To bomb the United States and England?
*  No, it's not.
*  So any of the responses that are taken are obviously illegitimate, at least if we rise
*  to minimal moral levels.
*  Well how do you deal with it?
*  Well actually there are proposals that make some sense, like the Vatican, you know, those
*  radicals in the Vatican.
*  Or Texas Foreign Affairs, you know, its main establishment journal.
*  In the current issue it happens to have published an article, which was actually written in
*  October, by Michael Howard, who's the preeminent Anglo-American military historian.
*  He's got all the right credentials, very supportive of the British Empire, thinks the American
*  Empire is even more wonderful, so perfect person.
*  Well, and a major military historian.
*  What he says is, in the case of a criminal conspiracy, which is what this obviously was,
*  the right approach is to carry out careful police investigation, find evidence as to
*  who the perpetrators were, if it's international and you have the evidence, go to an appropriate
*  international authority, which could be, say, the Security Council, under their authorization,
*  carry out actions, if they won't turn them over to you, which they might have, under
*  their authorization, carry out actions to find and apprehend the perpetrators, bring
*  them to an international tribunal where they can get a fair trial.
*  Okay, well that's an approach.
*  And in fact, if we take that approach seriously, we would do the same thing to Admiral Boyce,
*  Tony Blair, George Bush, Bill Clinton, George Bush the first, and anyone else.
*  The people who are running the current war on terrorism, like Donald Rumsfeld, who was
*  Ronald Reagan's special advisor to the Middle East when they were terrorizing the whole
*  region.
*  John Negroponte, who's running the diplomatic side of the current war on terrorism, and
*  was the proconsul in Honduras organizing the Contra armies attacking Nicaragua, for which
*  the US was condemned by the world court.
*  Yeah, write down the list, we would do the same thing to them.
*  That's assuming that we could reach minimal levels of moral integrity.
*  And of course, all of this is so remote from anything that you can even talk about in the
*  West that it's hard to say the words.
*  But then there's an elementary conclusion that follows from that.
*  Everyone in the West, and I have to include myself here because I don't propose this either,
*  everyone in the West is such a total hypocrite that for them even to talk about questions
*  of right or wrong is a disgrace.
