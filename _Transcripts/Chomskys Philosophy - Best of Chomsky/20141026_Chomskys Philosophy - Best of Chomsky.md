# Noam Chomsky - The Drone Campaign I
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [October 26, 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCsWAJF_1g4)
*  Days after the Boston bombing, there was a drone strike in Yemen, one of many, but this
*  one we happen to know about because a young man from the village that was hit testified
*  before the Senate a couple of days later and described it right at the same time.
*  And what he said is interesting and relevant.
*  He said that his village was in isolation.
*  They were trying to kill somebody in his village.
*  They said the man was perfectly well known.
*  They could have apprehended him if they wanted.
*  He was a drone strike is a terror weapon.
*  We don't talk about it that way, but it is.
*  Just imagine if you're walking down the street and you don't know whether in five minutes
*  there's going to be an explosion across the street from some place way up in the sky that
*  you can't see and somebody will be killed and whoever else is around will be killed
*  and maybe you'll be injured if you're there.
*  That just is a terror weapon.
*  It terrorizes villages, regions, huge areas.
*  In fact, it's the most massive terror campaign going on by a long shot.
*  And what happened in the village is that according to the testimony, the Senate testimony, that
*  he said that the jihadis had been trying for years to turn the villagers against the Americans
*  and had not succeeded.
*  He said in one drone strike they turned the entire village against the Americans.
*  That's maybe a couple hundred new people who will call terrorists if they take revenge.
*  It's a terror generating machine.
*  It's a terrorist operation and a terrorist generating machine.
*  So it goes on and on.
*  That's not just the drone strikes, also the special forces and so on.
*  Well that was right at the time of the Boston Marathon and it's just one of innumerable
*  cases.
*  And it's more than that.
*  The man who was targeted for whatever reason, they had to target him.
*  That's just murder.
*  There are principles going back 800 years to Magna Carta holding that people cannot
*  be punished by the state without being sentenced by a speedy trial of peers.
*  That's only 800 years old.
*  They have various excuses but I don't think they really apply.
*  And speaking of the drone wars, I can't help but think of John Bellinger, the chief architect
*  of the drone policy, who was speaking to a think tank recently and he said that Obama's
*  ramped up the drone killings simply to avoid the bad press of Gitmo, of capturing suspects
*  alive and trying them at Gitmo.
*  When you hear things like this, what is your response to people who say his hands are tied,
*  he wants to do well?
*  Well that was pointed out some time ago by a Wall Street Journal military correspondent.
*  What he pointed out is that Bush's technique was to capture people and torture them.
*  Obama's improved it.
*  You just kill them and anybody else who's around.
*  It's not that his hands are tied.
*  It's bad enough to capture them and torture them but just murder on executive whim.
*  As I say, it's not just murdering the suspects, a terror weapon terrorizes everyone else.
*  It's not that anyone's hands are tied, that's what he wants to do.
*  I'd rather be detained indefinitely than be blown up as well as my family and friends
*  around me.
*  That terrorizes everyone else.
*  There are recent polls which show that of an Arab public opinion, the results are kind
*  of interesting.
*  The Arabs don't particularly like Iran but they don't regard it as a threat.
*  It's ranked very low.
*  They do see threats in Egypt and Iraq and Yemen.
*  The United States is the major threat.
*  The policy of murdering people instead of capturing them and torturing them can be presented
*  to the public in a way that makes it look clean.
*  It's presented and I think most people see it this way as a kind of a surgical strike
*  which goes after people who are planning to do us harm.
*  This is a very frightened country, terrified country.
*  It has been for a long time.
*  If anybody's going to do us harm, it's fine for us to kill them.
*  Some of the reactions are, how this is interpreted is quite interesting.
*  For example, there was a case about a year or two ago when a drone attack in Yemen killed
*  a couple of little girls.
*  There was discussion but with a well-known liberal columnist, Joe Klein, he writes for
*  Time, he was asked what he thought about this and he said something like, it's better
*  that four of them are killed than four little girls here.
*  So, because, I mean the logic is mind boggling but if we have to kill people elsewhere who
*  might conceivably have aimed to harm us and it happens that a couple little girls get
*  killed too, that's fine.
*  We're entitled to do that.
*  I mean, suppose any country was doing that to us or to anyone we regard as a human.
*  It's incredible.
