# Noam Chomsky - Madison vs. Aristotle
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [August 29, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGfFXc0TwhU)
*  Madison pointed out that the British system would have problems if they
*  transferred it over here and that is because the United States they did want
*  to make it he did he and other the other founding fathers as they're called did
*  want to make it a more participatory and democratic society but he said a
*  democratic society has a serious flaw the flaw is that in democratic society
*  the people can participate and he said suppose what would suppose this were to
*  take place in England I suppose for example in England that they really
*  allowed people to vote which they didn't they said well the first thing people
*  would do would be to call for what we nowadays call agrarian reform that is
*  they would call for changes in the land laws which would grant more people
*  access to the highly privatized and centralized land system and that you
*  know land was a crucial part of the economy then and he says well we
*  obviously can't accept that you know we don't want to have any system that will
*  allow people to participate and infringe on the rights of private property and
*  wealth so therefore we have to be careful not to allow a democratic system
*  in which things really function democratically we have to make design a
*  system in which power is in the hands of the wealth of the nation quoting the
*  more capable set of men those who are sympathetic with the rights of property
*  okay they must have the power and the rest must be dispersed and factionalized
*  in such a way that they don't really interfere with the rights of power
*  actually Madison who is no fool recognized that this problem was going
*  to become greater as time went on as he put it if I can read my own notes he
*  said there's going to be an increase in the proportion of the population that
*  labors under all the hardships of life and secretly size for a more equal
*  distribution of its blessings okay there's going to be an increase in that
*  and if those people really have an ability to participate they're going to
*  do things which will infringe on the right of private power and private
*  property on the wealthy and therefore we have to design the system so that
*  doesn't happen and indeed the system was designed so that that wouldn't happen
*  that was the role of the Senate was to represent the wealth of the nation and
*  the role of the separation of powers and so on and so forth how well it
*  functioned you can argue it's an interesting question but it's worth
*  noticing that this idea about the nature of democracy has a long this this
*  problem in the nature of democracy you know that namely if people can vote
*  they're going to vote in their own interests and infringe on the rights of
*  private power and wealth that goes that insight goes way back goes back to the
*  origins of political theory so you read the first major book on political theory
*  and something like our sense Aristotle's politics that's a core question of
*  Aristotle's politics Aristotle distinguishes tyranny oligarchy and
*  democracy and there's a long elaborate discussion of each and favors democracy
*  I think it was perfect but he favored democracy as the best system for him a
*  democracy meant was very straightforward it meant a community of equals or to be
*  precise free men who are equals and that phrase free men is rather crucial but
*  put that aside for a moment a community of free men who are equal and
*  participatory and if unless it's equal and they can't be seriously
*  participatory he noticed the same problem that Madison did exactly the same problem
*  he said suppose that you did have a democracy where everyone participated
*  but you had radical inequality so concentration of wealth he said well
*  then the poorer part of the population which is the majority will use their
*  voting power to for their own interests to advance their own interests instead
*  of the common good of all okay and the goal of the democracy for Aristotle was
*  to advance the common good of all but if you had inequality radical inequality
*  well yeah the majority of the population would vote for their own interests which
*  would not be the common good of all so therefore he had to do something about
*  that same problem that that Madison faced you know exactly the same problem but
*  they reached opposite conclusions Madison's conclusion was that we should
*  reduce democracy so that you don't get the threat from the population Aristotle's
*  was the opposite you should reduce inequality so therefore the problem
*  won't arise and it'll be and you could have a real participatory democratic
*  system so Aristotle called for what we today would call a welfare state he said
*  that a democracy must be based on use of public revenues to ensure lasting
*  prosperity for everyone welfare state in other words and then he describes in
*  some detail how you could proceed to do that in Athens differently here but the
*  same kinds of questions and then if everyone had moderate but sufficient
*  income you wouldn't have this problem that both he and Madison faced but
*  notice that their choices were radically different one choice was to aim for
*  equality and participation in democracy the other the one on which our country
*  was founded was to reduce the threat of democracy maintain the inequality and
*  ensure that power remains in the Senate you know the capable class of men the
*  wealthy part of the you know the wealthy part of the society that's now
*  internationalized so this huge financial capital that's flowing around the world
*  is sometimes called by international economists a virtual Senate meaning it
*  has the power to ensure if you really liberalize capital to ensure that no
*  country will be able to undertake social policies that strike at the interest of
*  the wealthy because if any country moves in that direction the capital quickly
*  flows out of it the country goes down the tube so it's a virtual Senate you
*  know kind of generalization of Madison's Senate and the opposite of the
*  Aristotelian conception of democracy is necessarily based on a welfare state
*  and equality to go back to that word free men a democracy for Aristotle meant
*  men not women and free not slaves you know or aliens so it's a subpart of the
*  population but it's a little hard to dump on Aristotle for that since given
*  that those questions weren't even addressed and badly addressed until this
*  century you know and still are far from addressed but that's a significant
*  qualification but the principles are there and they come right up to the
*  present it's also been understood and by now it's and this this battle sort of
*  struggle up and back between the two conceptions of democracy is a large
*  part of modern history major theme of modern history runs right through the
*  19th century it's hard to remember now but in the 19th century which is a
*  rather anarchic period in the United States it was quite generally assumed
*  that you not only had to have an equal and participatory society but you
*  couldn't but that even wage labor was an intolerable infringement on human rights
*  that wasn't a radical position that was the slogan of the Republican Party for
*  example you can read it in the New York Times editorials in 1870 it was the
*  slogan under which many northern workers fought the Civil War it was Abraham
*  Lincoln's position wage labor is not very different from chattel slavery
*  because it's a it's a fundamental infringement on rights it was the major
*  theme of the working-class press which was quite lively around this area run by
*  you know women from the farms and artisans and so on their position was
*  look if you have a democracy the people who work in the mills have to own and
*  you have to move towards real participation and direct control and so
*  on and that remained major themes of perfectly mainstream US thinking right
*  up until the corporatization of America about a hundred years ago when
*  corporations developed collectivist legal institutions as they were called
*  which got enormous rights you know the rights of persons but in fact well
*  beyond persons because they're immortal and huge in comparison with persons that
*  was sharply attacked by conservatives a breed that doesn't exist anymore but did
*  exist a century ago of people who really believed in classical liberal doctrines
*  they recognized that corporations were themselves a major attack on markets and
*  that also an attack on the natural rights doctrines on which you know
*  conceptions of human rights and liberty were developed that was a big change and
*  it's again not graven and stone these were decisions
