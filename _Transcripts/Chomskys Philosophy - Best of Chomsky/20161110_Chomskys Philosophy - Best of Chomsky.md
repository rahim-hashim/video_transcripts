# Noam Chomsky - Solidarity
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [November 10, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eY_O6BNC3g)
*  From a cultural and ideological point of view, it's pretty interesting to look at the history.
*  So if we go back to the Enlightenment and the origins of classical liberalism, let's
*  say people like Adam Smith or David Hume and others, they simply took it for granted that
*  solidarity, sympathy, mutual aid were core elements of human nature.
*  They were the driving forces in human nature.
*  In fact, take Adam Smith's famous phrase, invisible hand.
*  The way it's interpreted is almost diametrically opposite to the way he used it.
*  In fact, he barely used it, but in one of the only twice actually.
*  And in one case, which is directly related to this, here's what he argues.
*  He says he was thinking of an agricultural economy, of course.
*  So he said, suppose some landowner accumulates almost all the land.
*  So everybody else has to essentially be his servant.
*  He says, well, this really won't matter very much because the landowner, by virtue of his
*  sympathy for other people and concern for their needs, will make sure that property
*  is distributed so that it will be relatively equal.
*  So as if by an invisible hand, it will end up with a fair and relatively egalitarian
*  society. Not a very powerful argument, but it shows the kind of driving concept that
*  underlies classical liberalism, enlightenment ideals, and so on.
*  Now, all of that ended with capitalism.
*  Adam Smith and David Hume and others are basically pre-capitalist.
*  Capitalist ideology is different.
*  It's get what you can for yourself and kick everyone else in the face.
*  And now it's claimed that that's human nature.
*  Is it? I don't think so.
*  I think Adam Smith, David Hume and others were basically correct.
*  This is a distorting ideology which is imposed on us and undermines normal human
*  emotions and interactions.
*  It's highly disturbing and deceitful.
*  And going back to the environmental crisis, that's what's causing us to race over the
*  precipice.
*  When Exxon Mobil executives say, OK, let's lie about fossil fuels, they're saying
*  they're actually what they're doing is pursuing what Adam Smith denounced as, in his
*  words, the vile maxim of the masters of mankind, all for ourselves and nothing for
*  anyone else.
*  Let's take the Occupy movement.
*  One of their achievements, in fact, I think one of the most important ones, has just been
*  to create communities of solidarity, mutual support, democratic participation.
*  That's a very important achievement, in fact, particularly in a society like ours, which
*  is kind of almost designed to isolate people and separate them from one another, which
*  is a great technique of control, of course.
*  So forming communities based on solidarity, sure, that's very important.
*  In fact, that's the reason why the labor movement from its origins has been concerned
*  with solidarity.
*  That's one of its main slogans.
*  We're going to have to work together.
*  We ought to work together because we ought to be helping one another, but that's the
*  only way in which we're going to confront concentrated power.
