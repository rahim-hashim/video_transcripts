# Noam Chomsky - Working Class Culture
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [March 26, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrwGWCxeKiw)
*  The people who read our books actually, even your books, I think, are generally students and intellectuals.
*  And it seems to me one of my concerns, and I expressed it to you before, is the huge split between the intellectual left,
*  the petit bourgeois intellectual left, and the workers whose concerns seem to be very different now.
*  And there is a huge difference, you see.
*  For example, in many countries when you complain about the far right,
*  well the far right does actually get the workers' vote in many places, you see.
*  Overwhelmingly. And the people who vote on the left tend to be intellectuals, teachers, students, and so on.
*  So there is a big split. There is a sort of a strange situation there.
*  It can be, but I'm speaking from my own experience.
*  It's mostly the United States and England, the other place where I'm often.
*  I don't, to some extent I agree, but I don't think it's as sharp as that.
*  I mean, I speak to trade union groups.
*  They're working people. They read the books.
*  My own background from childhood was with, my family was a working class, mostly unemployed working class in the 30s.
*  Very literate. High literate Larry culture.
*  Many of them never even, never went past elementary school.
*  But they were going to Shakespeare plays, discussing the latest concert of the Budapest string quartet,
*  reading Freud and Shtekl and debating fine points of psychiatry,
*  reading of course all the left literature.
*  That's pretty typical of working class culture.
*  And it goes right back to the 19th century.
*  You go back to the 19th century.
*  It was both in Britain and the United States, and it was also true of the radical workers in France and Germany.
*  They had a high level of intellectual culture and were reading serious material.
*  In fact, part of their condemnation in their own, they had their own working class press, was quite lively.
*  The press in the United States, for example, it was written by Irish artisans from Boston or young women from the farms who went into the textile mills.
*  One of their complaints was that the industrial system was destroying their intellectual culture.
*  In fact, one of the major activities of left intellectuals in the 1930s was to reach out to the general public with science, mathematics, high culture, workers education.
*  A lot of that has declined, but it doesn't have to disappear.
*  And I don't think it totally has disappeared.
*  I mean, a lot of the mail I get and the people who show up at talks are people without much...
*  By now, everybody's gone to high school, at least, as distinct from my own family.
*  But without advanced degrees, people are just interested.
*  I don't disagree with what you're saying.
*  There is more of a break than there ought to be, but it doesn't have to be, and I think it can be overcome.
