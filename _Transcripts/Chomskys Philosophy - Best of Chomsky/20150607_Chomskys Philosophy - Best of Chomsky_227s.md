# Noam Chomsky - Activism and Organization
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [June 07, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buNcurSMa3k)
*  I'm just an ordinary mom who just thinks in terms of I don't want to someday be holding my grandchildren and
*  watching something horrible happen and feel like I didn't do anything and
*  I mean it's obvious what what you're doing and my question is on a practical level
*  Where do you see the most practical place to put your energy?
*  I mean tonight I feel an overwhelm like I feel like it's too big. It's too much to even make a dent in
*  The way things change is because lots of people are working all the time and
*  you know they're working in their communities in their workplace or wherever they happen to be and they're building up the basis for
*  Popular movements which are going to make changes
*  That's the way everything has ever happened in history, you know, whether it was the end of slavery or whether it was the Democratic
*  Revolutions or anything you want you name it. That's the way it worked
*  You get a very false picture of this from the history books
*  In the history books, there's a couple of leaders
*  You know George Washington or Martin Luther King or whatever
*  And I don't want to say that those people are unimportant like Martin Luther King was certainly important
*  But he was not the Civil Rights Movement
*  Martin Luther King can appear in the history books because lots of people whose names you will never know and whose names are all
*  Forgotten and who may have been killed and so on were working down in the south
*  When you have active activists and people concerned and people devoting themselves and dedicating themselves to social change or issues or whatever
*  Then people like me can appear and we can appear to be prominent
*  But that's not because somebody else is doing the work
*  My work whether it's giving hundreds of talks a year or spending 20 hours a week writing letters or writing books is not directed to the South
*  It's directed to what are called ordinary people
*  And what I expect from them is in fact exactly what they are
*  That they should try to understand the world and act in accordance with their decent impulses
*  And that they should try to improve the world and many people are willing to do that
*  But they have to understand and in fact as far as I can see in these things
*  I feel that I'm simply not doing the right thing
*  What did you mean by that?
*  What would such a course be?
*  I don't mean go to school because you're not going to get it there
*  It means you have to develop an independent mind and work on it
*  Now that's extremely hard to do alone
*  The beauty of our system is it isolates everybody
*  Each person is sitting alone in front of the tube
*  And I think that's the beauty of it
*  I think that's the beauty of it
*  The beauty of our system is it isolates everybody
*  Each person is sitting alone in front of the tube
*  It's very hard to have ideas or thoughts under those circumstances
*  You can't fight the world alone
*  Some people can but it's pretty rare
*  The way to do it is through organization
*  So courses of intellectual self-defense will have to be in the context of political and other organizations
*  And it makes sense I think to look at what the institutions are trying to do
*  And to take that almost as a key
*  What they're trying to do is what we're trying to combat
*  If they're trying to keep people isolated and separate and so on
*  Well we're trying to do the opposite
*  We're trying to bring them together
*  So in your local community you want to have sources of alternative action
*  People with parallel concerns may be differently focused
*  But at the core sort of similar values
*  And a similar interest in helping people learn how to defend themselves against external power
*  And taking control of their lives
*  And reaching out your hand to people who need it
*  That's a common array of concerns
*  You can learn about your own values
*  And you can figure out how to defend yourself
*  And so on in conjunction with others
