# Noam Chomsky - Democracy in the Workplace
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [July 08, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wYzn2hKydA)
*  Can you have, say, worker self-management in industry?
*  I mean, I don't know of any law that says you can't,
*  law of nature that says you can't or law of history.
*  And I think that'd be a lot better than management control.
*  Can you have something better than the state capitalist
*  institutions that we have?
*  Yeah, we can design lots of others.
*  In fact, we can go back to the workers in the mills
*  and Lawrence Mass, who took for granted that those who work
*  in the mills should own them and should run them
*  and should run them democratically.
*  Is that so outlandish?
*  And you can say the same about the communities and so on.
*  Business is a tyranny, okay?
*  It's like a Soviet Union.
*  It's got control from the top.
*  If you're in the middle, you take orders from above
*  and you hand them down below.
*  At the very bottom, you're allowed to rent yourself to it.
*  Now, it's not obvious why things have to work like that.
*  Could be democratically controlled by the participant.
*  No owners, no managers, just those who participate.
*  And in fact, there could be a broader participation.
*  So it's somewhere, it's in a community.
*  And the community should have some say in it.
*  So you have community participation
*  and participation on the part of the workforce.
*  That's perfectly feasible.
*  In fact, there are plenty of ideas that have been around
*  like that for a long time and some of them have worked out.
*  So is the question that we have to ask ourselves
*  is that a possible alternative?
*  Sure it is.
*  Is it the kind of possible alternative
*  we want to work for?
*  If it is, it would dismantle capitalism.
*  But we have to decide, is that what we want
*  or is that what other people want?
*  I mean, is that what the workers and the plant want?
*  My guess is that most people are ready for it this minute
*  and that if the opportunity arises, they'd leap at it.
*  I mean, I don't think they need us to encourage them.
*  It's just that the options aren't there.
*  For people in a plant to do it means taking
*  a very serious risk.
*  So the first risk will be that the Royal Canadian
*  Mounted Police or whatever the counterpart is
*  will come in and beat the shit out of them.
*  That's a risk.
*  And unless they have community support,
*  they're not gonna get away with it.
*  So it's a struggle, that's class struggle.
*  But if you talk to workers in a plant,
*  I don't think many of them would find this very hard
*  to understand, that they ought to run it themselves.
*  I mean, they can understand it as much as the factory girls
*  in Lowell in 1860.
*  I think that's just below the surface in all groups
*  that I've ever had anything to do with.
