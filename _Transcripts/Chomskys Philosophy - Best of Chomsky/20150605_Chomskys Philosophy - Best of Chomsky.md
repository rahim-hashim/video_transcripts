# Noam Chomsky - Class
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [June 05, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25JxV_H7lfM)
*  What's the word class mean to you?
*  Or the concept? What do you think it refers to? What's class?
*  It has a history, but I'm pretty simple minded, frankly.
*  If I can't see something in simple terms, I don't understand it in these areas. It's not like science.
*  If you take a look at society, there are just different roles that people play.
*  There are people who give orders, and there are people who take orders.
*  And in fact, it gets institutionalized.
*  So for example, take say the corporate system again.
*  It's very strikingly institutionalized.
*  There are the directors and the banks who own them and so on and so forth.
*  They basically set the framework.
*  There are the managers who sort of work out how to apply things.
*  They have their own initiative and they give orders.
*  And you go down the line and there are people who just take orders.
*  They're not totally passive, like workers can strike and all sorts of other things.
*  But the array of decision making and control is fairly sharp.
*  Those are classes.
*  By virtue of the position and the economy and the roles that people play,
*  they have different interests, opposed interests, etc.
*  They use different terms for other kinds of hierarchy and domination.
*  So let's take a patriarchal family.
*  So maybe the father gives the orders and the mother follows the orders and the kids do what they're told.
*  Okay, we don't call that class.
*  But that's just a terminological point.
*  It's another illustration of the same kind of structural relation.
*  Economic classes and then this.
*  Is classlessness possible in an economy?
*  It's kind of like asking whether slavery is necessary.
*  You go back to the 18th century.
*  If you ask people, how can you have a society without slaves?
*  Can we eliminate class in other respects?
*  Sure. Why not?
*  Why can't workers run factories?
*  In fact, it's a very live issue right now.
*  These issues are just below the surface right now.
*  So let's be concrete.
*  There's an economic crisis and there's an environmental crisis.
*  And it's agreed across the board that one way the United States has to try to deal with this
*  is to overcome our hopelessly backward infrastructure.
*  Backward as compared with Europe and Japan.
*  So we have a terrible transportation system.
*  It was designed that way.
*  It was designed and massive social engineering projects after the war to be highly inefficient.
*  Inefficient from the point of money making.
*  But based basically on wasteful use of fossil fuels.
*  That's why you have suburbanization, destroy the railroads and so on and so forth.
*  Major state corporate projects.
*  All right, that's now kind of like can't go on.
*  We've got to sort of at least catch up to the rest of the industrial world.
*  So you need high speed rail.
*  Okay, how do you get high speed rail?
*  Well, Obama sends his transportation secretary to Spain
*  so that he can use federal stimulus money, meaning taxpayer money,
*  to buy, to make contracts in Spain for Spain, you know,
*  it's like not some super power, to provide us with high speed rail.
*  At the very same time Obama's continuing to follow the deindustrialization policies from the 1970s.
*  You know, close down GM plants and so on and so forth.
*  It's kind of like, you couldn't imagine a more massive criticism of the socioeconomic system
*  destroying a factory doesn't just mean destroying the factory.
*  It means destroying the workforce, you know, the community.
*  The community is usually built up around the factories and so on.
*  Well, there's an answer.
*  The people in those factories could take over the plants, run them themselves,
*  convert them to high speed rail production.
*  It's a task, but not an insoluble one like conversion of American industry to wartime production in the 1940s
*  was a far bigger task and was done very successfully.
*  It might need some community federal support, a fraction of what's paid to the banks.
*  So it's perfectly feasible.
