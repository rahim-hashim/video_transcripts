# Noam Chomsky - Clinton, Turkey, and the Attacks on the Kurds
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [February 15, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDoBBFVWLTg)
*  The Clinton administration particularly
*  poured arms into Turkey
*  To try to it to support their counterinsurgency operations, which were not just against the PKK
*  They carried out major atrocities all throughout southeastern Turkey and the Kurdish areas
*  They destroyed according to the Turkish government about 3,500 towns and villages wiped them out
*  drove out
*  Probably millions of people I've been there and I've seen it and I've also seen the slums in Istanbul where the remnants try to survive
*  They think the number of people killed nobody knows because we don't count our own atrocities
*  But according to Kurdish sources, it's on the order of 50,000. That's from the mayor of Diyarbakir
*  Usual numbers given a 30,000
*  So, you know massive atrocities as if you want to read there's a lot of evidence about this there are deep
*  They haven't have a very good human rights
*  Specialist Jonathan Sugden their analyst in southeastern Turkey
*  He has now been kicked out by the Turkish government because trying to investigate what's happening
*  But he has did compile very serious
*  Detailed reports right through the 90s every imaginable kind of torture barbarism
*  destruction
*  ecological devastation
*  Huge ethnic cleansing
*  One of the major atrocities of the 1990s and so did Amnesty International
*  So of independent reporters and others as and in fact in Turkey, there are plenty of people know about this
*  I've taken part in Istanbul in protests by
*  Leading Turkish writers
*  academics
*  artists
*  Journalists and others who are courageously
*  Protesting against these atrocities, which is not easy in Turkey, you know, it's not Turkish jails are not much fun
*  But they not only protest against them, but they're constantly carrying out civil disobedience against them
*  I was able to participate once and it's because they know perfectly well what's happening
*  Furthermore they wanted publicized
*  so when I was visiting Turkey actually to take part in a
*  Trial of a publisher who was being sent to jail because he published a few remarks of mine about it
*  I was just invited all over the place by Turkish television because they wanted it said and they can't say it
*  So it was all over the papers and television and so on
*  Was in fact often given a award by the Turkish Publishers Association
*  Not because I did anything particularly remarkable, but just because I was saying what they knew and can't say
*  the
*  As the atrocities escalated through the 90s aid from the Clinton administration increased
*  by 19 and the year single year
*  1997 one year
*  Clinton provided more arms to the Turkish military than the entire Cold War period
*  Combined up to the onset of the counterinsurgency
*  Well took a lot of discipline here in the United States for the press to shut up about this
*  I mean here they're talking about, you know, terrible atrocities going on in the Balkans by these bad Serbs and others
*  Meanwhile right on the board
*  How can we stand it if right on the borders of NATO some terrible thing is happening?
*  Try to find an article which said right within the borders of NATO even worse things are happening and you're paying for it
*  Not just the United States Germany involved Britain and others, but primarily the Clinton administration
