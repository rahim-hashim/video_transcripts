# Noam Chomsky - Values, Abortion, and Preserving Life
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [February 07, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fBjaPPzu1I)
*  There are conflicting values and taken in isolation each of the values is quite legitimate
*  So the value of preserving human life or for that matter the life of any organism
*  that
*  That is a value that we should accept. You shouldn't just go
*  arbitrarily kill some animal because it's fun to kill it I
*  That's a reasonable value on the other hand most people agree to swat a mosquito
*  Okay, well that the idea that life is should be valued has come into conflict with another value
*  And we know what that one is and that's commonly the case
*  The values that we hold are not absolute
*  They are always contingent
*  They conflict and life is made up of decisions in complicated situations in cases of conflicting values
*  If you listen to just one in isolation, yeah, it may sound legitimate and and maybe is
*  But you have to ask what it means under particular conditions
*  So choice is legitimate preserving life is legitimate and sometimes they run into conflict is reasonably well
*  In fact very well established
*  That as women have more opportunities
*  more education
*  As better medical care is available as more family planning is available
*  Fertility rates go down
*  abortion goes down
*  Children are better cared for and women are healthier those things are known
*  and
*  Those are all things that are easily under
*  Social control and that are not should not be controversial. I don't think there should be anything controversial
*  about making sure that
*  women can have access to decent
*  Say obstetric care now that alone would save hundreds of thousands of lives every year
*  If you want to do things that will help people there are very easy ways to do it and it's not just true of women
*  it's also true of children
*  UNICEF also reports that
*  My memory is correct that about 15 million children die every year
*  from mostly from easily treatable diseases
*  Meaning sometimes things like you know lack of drinkable water
*  and our dehydration, you know
*  Diarrhea things that can very easily be treated and could be treated for literally pennies a day from the rich countries
*  Okay, we're serious about saving lives saving children's lives. They're easy ways to do it
*  On the other hand if you look at the same people who were
*  most militant about
*  Saving the fetus are they calling for increasing?
*  Foreign aid are they are they concerned with the fact that the United States has the most miserable
*  Miserly foreign aid program of any developed country by quite a large margin
*  The country's got plenty of wealth, you know, the means are easily they are there. They're just being used
*  the social policy is being designed to
*  enrich the wealthy even further and let the poor suffer if
*  Let the children die let them starve let the mothers die and so on that's an overwhelming problem
*  once people
*  Among people who are willing to address those problems people are willing to address those problems
*  We can at least take seriously when they talk about values
*  When you can take people seriously when they talk about values, you can listen to what they say about other things like abortion
*  Which is a hard question
*  But you know, I'm not I don't think we should be interested in discussing it with people whose values are such that they don't care
*  about the massive problem of
*  Killing and harming women and children that they could easily deal with and are doing nothing about
*  Bible like any complex historical text
*  presents a God who can be called upon to justify mass genocide and who can be called upon to justify
*  mercy to
*  widows and orphans same God depends what you want to what parts of the
*  texts you want to interpret everyone in the debate as opposed to
*  outright infanticide that is taking a live child and deciding to kill them because too much trouble to take care of them
*  everyone agrees on that
*  Everyone agrees I suppose that
*  Women are allowed to wash their hands
*  Although I suppose I guess you could make a case if you went over to the biology department
*  That when a woman washes her hands lots of cells flake off and some future technology
*  Might be able to use the information in those cells to construct the potential child
*  so somewhere between say washing your hands and
*  killing
*  Your three-year-old somewhere between that there is a decision to be there are decisions to be made about
*  How we're going to balance what we call
*  Life which in fact is there in the cells on your hand
*  How we're going to balance what we call life against lots of other problems and those decisions are not simple
*  People who say well, I know it's at this number of days
*  There can't be taken seriously what we're talking about ambiguous issues of a complicated kind
*  Where you have to balance conflicting interests and concerns as is generally the case in human life
*  You're not going to get the answers from holy texts. You're not going to get the answers from biologists. These are matters of
*  Human concern that have to be discussed
*  seriously reasonably with
*  attention to the
*  Array of value differing values often that people have and different decisions they may come to under similar circumstances
