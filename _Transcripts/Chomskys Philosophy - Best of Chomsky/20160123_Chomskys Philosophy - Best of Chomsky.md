# Noam Chomsky - Criticizing the U.S.
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [January 23, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I85zHItr5BQ)
*  I spoke to someone about you today, and he said the following to me.
*  Someone who many of his views you would recommend, you would agree with, some not.
*  He said to me that after complimenting your mind, the quality of the mind, and contributions you had made,
*  he said that what you had done has turned American exceptionalism on its back.
*  And that you're, for all those who believed in American exceptionalism, you would believe in exactly the opposite.
*  Whatever that is. And let me stay with this question.
*  On the other hand, there are people who have asked you, look, if you have such strong feelings about how wrongheaded American policy has been,
*  why don't you leave the country a frequent sort of thing that's thrown at people who are critical frequently.
*  And you always say, I love this country.
*  I mean, it's a very interesting question. Let's try it on some other country.
*  You know, it's sometimes easier to think about things clearly if we distance ourselves.
*  Let's go back to say, the big enemy, Soviet Union.
*  I mean, the Russians would have been delighted to have the dissidents leave the country.
*  If Sakharov had been willing to come to the West, they would have applauded.
*  But does it make sense to ask Sakharov, why don't you leave the Soviet Union?
*  I'm not asking that question. I'm actually using that question to make the point that you've always said.
*  That's the framework in which the question should be understood.
*  It's assuming that you can't have it in a private society.
*  You stay and fight for values because you love the country.
*  And you think that the country ought to live up to these values.
*  You can't rank countries A, B, C, D.
*  Countries have all sorts of properties.
*  There's a culture, there's a society, there's modes of interaction and so on.
*  A lot of the things that are simply achievements.
*  Take, say, protection of free speech. It's unique in the United States.
*  There are a lot of great things that have been achieved.
*  There are a lot of rotten things that have been done.
*  If you have any concern about the country, meaning its people, its culture and so on,
*  you want to save and extend and amplify the achievements and modify the crimes.
*  And you would put the protection of free speech high up on that list.
*  Very high. It's not the only one.
*  Okay, well tell me more and then we'll come to some of the criticisms that you have made about American imperialism and the like.
*  See, we have to make a distinction between state power and a country.
*  The different things.
*  I understand the difference.
*  But it's often not distinguished.
*  If you criticize state policy, you're not criticizing a country.
*  I understand that too.
*  I mean, first of all, frequently when you're traveling around the world, I do.
*  You know, people say I love America.
*  I hate the policy.
*  I hate the policy.
*  And we're responsible for the policy. It's a free country.
*  We can't say, you know, I don't have any responsibility for the policy because we do.
*  We may not know about it, but then we should find out about it.
*  And if we decide we don't like it, we should change it.
*  In fact, take a look at the question we've just been discussing, two-state settlement.
*  About two-thirds of the American population supports the international consensus on this and long has.
*  Which is there ought to be a two-state solution.
*  Roughly the 67 borders.
*  And it's kind of interesting to look at the polls.
*  I mean, polls will, you find roughly two-thirds of the population saying, yeah, they support that.
*  And roughly the same proportion says the U.S. ought to become more involved in the diplomacy.
*  People don't know that that's a contradiction.
*  The reason that that policy hasn't, that program has not been achieved is because of consistent U.S. intervention to prevent it from being achieved.
*  And that continues at this very moment, in fact.
*  Okay, it is a free country. We've got a lot of freedom.
*  That means we have people have the opportunity to discover its work.
*  You know, it's not going to come easily.
*  It's where the Internet is built.
*  They have the opportunity to discover the relevant facts and background, which should show them that their position is contradictory.
*  They must come to understand what the U.S. government role has been over the years in preventing the outcome that they want.
