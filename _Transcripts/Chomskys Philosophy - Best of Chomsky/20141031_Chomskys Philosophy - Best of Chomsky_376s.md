# Noam Chomsky on the Tea Party Movement
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [October 31, 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwTht2L4jqA)
*  I think the implications are dangerous, but it's easy to ridicule them.
*  Look at the crazy things they say, you want to kill my grandmother, and so on.
*  And there's a lot of nonsense, that's true.
*  But what we really ought to be asking ourselves is why the peace movement, the left, the activist
*  organizations aren't organizing these people.
*  A lot of what they're protesting is pretty sensible.
*  A lot of the protests, for example, are against the bailout, the massive bailout.
*  They feel that they were betrayed.
*  They pressured, worked very hard to prevent it, and two minutes later they got it.
*  Why should the bankers end up from the recession more powerful than they were before, which
*  is what's happening.
*  You can read it in the business press, they're exalting about it.
*  They're more powerful than they were before, the big banks are even bigger than they were.
*  The government insurance policy, the too big to fail insurance policy, is guaranteeing
*  them that they can continue doing exactly what they were doing, which tanked the economy.
*  They can make risky loans and investments.
*  Since it's risky, they'll make a lot of profit, money coming out of their ears.
*  If it collapses, the taxpayer will come in and bail them out because they're too big
*  to fail.
*  Bonuses and profits are going through the roof, and meanwhile people are suffering.
*  Well, they have a reason to protest that.
*  And the tragedy is that the protests, and many other things, the protests are being
*  organized by pretty much the same sectors that are creating the crisis.
*  The corporate money that's behind them is the ones who are very happy that it's coming
*  out like this.
*  And it's a real failure of the activist movements, the left, the peace movement, and so on, that
*  we're not organizing.
*  I think that's the question we ought to ask.
*  And there are other things.
*  I mean, there are historical memories that are awakened.
*  You don't want to draw analogies too closely, but there are some similarities which are
*  not encouraging, certainly for someone my age.
*  These people have real grievances.
*  I mean, I have not seen a demographic analysis of those who call in on talk shows, but I
*  talk to them a lot, and they're interesting.
*  If you sort of suspend disbelief, you forget about reality of the world and just listen.
*  It's not a joke.
*  If you listen, the message that comes across has an internal logic to it.
*  It's coherent.
*  It gives answers to people who want answers and need them and deserve them.
*  They're crazy answers, but they're not hearing any others.
*  These are people who've worked hard.
*  They've done everything right, Christian, God-fearing, take care of their families.
*  And for 30 years, they've been shafted.
*  The people who, for the last 30 years, have seen their wages, income stagnate or decline,
*  benefits decline, services decline.
*  There's nothing for the children.
*  World's out of control.
*  These are the people who, on polls, maybe 80% of them say the country's going in the
*  wrong direction, the government's run by the few in the special interests, not the people
*  and so on.
*  You know, they're not wrong.
*  This is all happening to them.
*  And the answers that they're getting from, say, Rush Limbaugh, Michael Savage, the rest
*  of them are, well, we have an answer.
*  The rich liberals own everything.
*  They own the corporations.
*  They run the government.
*  They run the media.
*  And they don't care about people like you.
*  They don't care about the flyover people between the East Coast and the West Coast.
*  They only care about giving everything you work for away to illegal immigrants or gays
*  or something.
*  So we've got to protect ourselves from them.
*  And furthermore, they run the government.
*  When they put up a health program, it's not to give you health.
*  It's to kill your granny.
*  And that's an answer to something.
*  It's a terrible answer, but it is an answer.
*  And if you do suspend disbelief, you forget about what's happening in the world, really.
*  It's a coherent answer.
*  Now, they're not hearing anything else.
*  And the memory that comes to my mind, again, I don't want to press the analogy too hard,
*  but I think it's worth thinking about, is late Weimar Germany.
*  There were people with real grievances.
*  The Nazis gave them an answer.
*  It's the fault of the Jews and the Bolsheviks, and we've got to protect ourselves from them.
*  And that'll take care of your grievances.
*  And we know what happened.
*  Germany in the 1920s was the peak of Western civilization in the arts and the sciences,
*  highly democratic functioning democratic institutions.
*  A decade later, it was the pits of human history.
*  Again, the analogy is not close, but it's frightening.
*  And unless an answer can be given to these people, unless they can be led to understand
*  what's really happening to them, we could be in for trouble.
