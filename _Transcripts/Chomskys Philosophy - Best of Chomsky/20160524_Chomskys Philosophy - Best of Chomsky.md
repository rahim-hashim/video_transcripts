# Noam Chomsky - The Israel/Palestine Conflict II
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [May 24, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGbILqjyNHg)
*  There are a lot of problems in the world for which it's pretty hard to figure out a solution.
*  This one happens to be particularly uniquely easy to figure out the solution.
*  There is one, it's been on the table for 35 years.
*  Virtually the entire world supports it.
*  The only holdouts are the United States and Israel, at least in theory and words, Europe,
*  non-Lion countries, the Arab states, the organization of Islamic states, which includes Iran, and
*  basically all agree on a political settlement on the internationally recognized border,
*  the so-called Green Line, pre-67 borders, with two states, Israel and a Palestinian
*  state in the occupied territories, and possibly some adjustment of the border.
*  It was a ceasefire line.
*  So when the U.S. was still part of this consensus, it called for a moderate and mutual border
*  adjustments.
*  That was actually brought to the Security Council in January 1976.
*  The U.S. vetoed it again in 1980.
*  This won't run through the whole record, but it's basically a record of U.S. refusal to
*  accept it.
*  Of course, Israel refuses.
*  They want to take over as much as is valuable to them of the occupied territories.
*  There actually is one occasion when the U.S. came close to accepting it.
*  That was in January 2001, Clinton's last month in office.
*  He provided what he called parameters for settlement.
*  Both sides accepted them, as he pointed out.
*  They met for a week and talked about Egypt, tried to work out the details, and they apparently
*  came pretty close to a settlement.
*  I was in the Middle East recently as well, and one of the things I heard, we were in
*  Ramallah and we talked to a lot of Palestinians on both sides of the border, that the split
*  between Hamas and Fatah is, number one, weakening any real form of resistance, and number two,
*  that any state that might emerge out of this two-state, if in fact anything does, and there's
*  feeling that Israel, the current leadership of Israel and most of the Israeli elite, has
*  no interest in it.
*  But this split between Hamas and Fatah is really undermining any real Palestinian resistance.
*  What do you make of that?
*  It's real, and there's a background.
*  Since the early 90s, the United States and Israel have been working to try to separate
*  the Gaza Strip from the West Bank.
*  By now, they're almost totally separated.
*  A student in Gaza who wants to go to university in the West Bank, almost impossible.
*  Somebody wants to go for medical treatment in a Palestinian hospital in East Jerusalem,
*  which isn't available on the Gaza Strip.
*  It's essentially blocked, partly by Palestinian authority in Hamas, but primarily by Israel.
*  So that's gone very far.
*  Even by the 80s, Israel had recognized it just wants to get rid of the Gaza Strip.
*  It's so devastated, no use handing it over to Egypt.
*  That increased.
*  In January 2006, there was a free election in Palestine, the first one in the Arab world,
*  carefully monitored and so on.
*  It came out the wrong way.
*  Hamas won the election.
*  That's not what the U.S. wanted.
*  In the typical disdain for free elections, if they don't come out the right way, the
*  United States and of course Israel instantly turned to harsh punishment of the population
*  for the crime of voting the wrong way.
*  Europe trailed along timidly as it usually does.
*  In June 2007, the U.S. and Israel tried to carry out a military coup to overthrow the
*  results of the election in Gaza.
*  It didn't work.
*  It was beaten back and Hamas took over.
*  At that point, sanctions became much harsher.
*  What you now read is Hamas by force took over the Gaza Strip.
*  Sort of half true, but it was in beating back a U.S.-Israeli planned military coup initiative.
*  By now, Hamas kind of runs the Gaza Strip with a pretty harsh hand.
*  The Palestinian Authority runs as much of the West Bank as they control, which is very
*  little of it, pretty harshly and with international support.
*  Yes, that split is there.
*  Both sides by now have a stake in it.
*  Hamas to run the Gaza Strip, Fatah, the Palestinian Authority to run the West Bank.
*  It's a barrier to joint resistance.
*  Of course, the U.S. and Israel are very happy because they want to undermine the possibility
*  of a settlement.
*  Now, the settlement option is still there.
*  January 2001 is not that far back.
*  Things have changed, but not so much.
*  And it's feasible.
*  If the United States shifted its policy, right now the United States is basically blocking
*  it.
*  Blocking it not in words.
*  They say, yes, we want it, but they're blocking it by providing decisive military, economic,
*  diplomatic and ideological support for the Israeli takeover.
*  Ideological means, well, it's the way it's presented and discussed and so on.
*  Our most cherished ally.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's significant.
*  I mean, by now Israel, the settlements occupy over 40% of the territory.
*  About 60% of the territory is under, called area C, is under the control of the Israeli
*  army.
*  It's not necessary.
*  When I was in the West Bank and in some of the refugee camps in Beirut and other, in
*  Lebanon, a lot of Palestinians were saying they thought that the two-state solution is
*  dead and that there really is one state.
*  And then they're all living under the same one state.
*  It's just that some people get to vote and others don't.
*  And that the issue now is that there should be a movement, one person, one vote, and that
*  the Palestinians and Jews that want a democratic state should simply take over the one state
*  that's there.
*  Personally, I've been in favor of that since the 1940s.
*  But it's pie in the sky.
*  And they're omitting the fact.
*  This is a common discussion on both sides and in the world.
*  And it's just omitting an elementary fact.
*  There aren't two alternatives.
*  There are three alternatives.
*  They're only talking about two.
*  One alternative is the international consensus on two states.
*  Second alternative, let's all live together in one state.
*  The third alternative, which is the one that's being implemented, is that the U.S. and Israel
*  take what they want and continue to take what they want.
*  And those who are talking about let's have one state are actually assisting in that because
*  the United States is perfectly happy to have articles and newspapers saying, fine, let's
*  everybody live together.
*  Meanwhile, they are participating with Israel in separating Gaza from the West Bank, a crucial
*  fact, and providing the decisive support for the implementation of the programs, which
*  are sometimes called the Sharon blend.
*  Take over whatever you want in the West Bank.
*  Everything behind the annexation wall, it's called separation wall.
*  It's basically annexation.
*  That means the Arab land, the water resources, the pleasant suburbs of Jerusalem and Tel
*  Aviv support the completely illegal expansion of Jerusalem that's not only in violation
*  of international law, but even of direct explicit Security Council resolutions, which the U.S.
*  indeed voted for.
*  The whole occupation settlement program is illegal, and it's been known.
*  Israel even accepted it.
*  They said we're going to do it anyway.
*  It's not even worth discussing this universal agreement on this.
*  But the U.S. is blocking it, and that permits these programs of taking over what's valuable.
*  Everything hugely expanded Jerusalem, everything behind the separation wall, the annexation
*  wall, the Jordan Valley, which imprisons everything else, a couple of salients cutting through
*  essentially cantonize the rest.
*  By now Israel's constructed a huge infrastructure project, huge highways and so on.
*  You can drive from Tel Aviv to the most eastern towns like Maalad, Umi, or Ariel without ever
*  seeing a Palestinian.
*  Palestinians are sort of off there on the hill somewhere.
*  So that's the real alternative.
*  If there isn't a two-state settlement, this is what there's going to be.
*  You can talk about one state, and it would be nice to be democratic and so on, but nothing
*  is supporting it.
*  There's no support for it in the world.
*  There's no steps towards it.
*  Sometimes it's compared to South Africa.
*  But what people are forgetting is there was decades of struggle to get the world to oppose
*  apartheid.
*  In fact, until the United States changed its position in the late 1980s, it didn't really
*  matter what the world thought.
*  The U.S. was still supporting it.
*  Reagan was violating congressional sanctions at that point.
*  But until the U.S. shifted its position, it was there.
*  As late as 1988, the Reagan administration condemned the African National Congress, Mandela's
*  National Congress, as one of the most notorious terrorist groups in the world.
*  Do you see any potential for a change in U.S. position, or to some extent a change in U.S.
*  public opinion?
*  There's a substantial change in U.S. public opinion.
*  I mean, a lot of issues, there was a time not long ago when I talked about these issues,
*  I needed police protection.
*  And now there's huge audiences.
*  There's a standard gauge.
*  There's a EDS, sanctions, divestment program, which is substantial.
*  A large part of the American public, if they knew about it, would be opposed, in fact outraged
*  by the idea that Obama made a commitment to Israel to provide them with $30 billion of
*  military aid over the next decade.
*  People here are even talking about the U.S. military budget.
*  Most people don't want it handed over to Israel.
*  So sure, it would be, and in fact, if Obama or anybody in the administration was willing
*  to take a stand on this, they could mobilize public opinion.
*  What's happening is pretty striking.
*  The strongest support in the media, the most extreme support for Israeli expansion and
*  aggression is the far right.
*  It's the Wall Street Journal, much more than, say, the New York Times.
*  In the political system, it's the Republicans, the party of big business, even more so than
*  Democrats too, but they're more so.
*  And in fact, the military industry, the high-tech industry and so on, they think this is fine.
*  They're investing there.
*  Lockheed Martin is delighted when we give Israel funds to buy advanced aircraft and
*  so on.
*  There is a base of support for these policies right at the core of the system.
*  There's also a substantial lobby, which is influential.
*  I think that's minor as compared with these more fundamental sources of support, but those
*  are not kind of like what we talked about on another occasion.
*  It's not what the public wants, and that can be changed.
