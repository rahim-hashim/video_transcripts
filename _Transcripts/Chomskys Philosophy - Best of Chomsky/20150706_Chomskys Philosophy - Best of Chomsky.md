# Noam Chomsky on WikiLeaks
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [July 06, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gwuFjFNGpQ)
*  So let's take WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks is a democratizing force. It's giving individuals access to decisions
*  and thinking by their representatives. In a democracy that ought to be reflexive,
*  but on the contrary WikiLeaks is being heavily under heavy attack by the government and
*  corporations are participating in that by closing down their websites. But Julian Assange shouldn't be
*  the subject of grand jury hearings. He should be given a medal. He's contributing to democracy.
*  I mean, I've spent a lot of time, long before the technology revolution, there was declassification
*  of documents and I've spent quite a lot of time studying declassified internal documents.
*  Written a lot about them. In fact, anybody who's worked through the declassified record
*  can see very clearly that the reason for classification is very rarely to protect
*  the state or the society from enemies. Most of the time it's to protect the state from its citizens
*  so that they don't know what the government's doing. So it's kind of internal defense,
*  which raises a question, should we even have the classification system?
*  Why shouldn't these things be open? I mean, there are things that you want to keep secret, like the
*  characteristics of your latest fighter plane or something like that. But most of what's done,
*  I think, is kept secret so the public won't know. And I think this name is true of whatever WikiLeaks
*  are exposing. And what WikiLeaks are exposing is kind of superficial in a way. Like say the
*  Pentagon Papers. That went much deeper. That went to internal government planning back for 25 years.
*  Those are things that the public should have known about. In a democracy, they should have known
*  what leaders are thinking and planning about major enterprises like the Vietnam War.
*  It was kept secret from them. WikiLeaks is providing information on what ambassadors are
*  sending to Washington, things like that. I mean, maybe some of that has a right to some kind of
*  secrecy, but there's a heavy burden. And I think it'd be pretty hard to meet. I mean, I haven't
*  read everything from WikiLeaks by any means, but the parts that I've read and seen, I think,
*  are things that the public should know. It seems that there's a difference in content in
*  what WikiLeaks revealed and what the Pentagon... Totally different. But the medium was different,
*  because I know you were involved in publishing the book as well, right? Yeah, but also I had them
*  in advance, and I could write about them. Actually, when Dan Ellsberg was underground,
*  I was one of the people, there were a number of people who were giving out materials to the press.
*  But WikiLeaks happened through the internet, which wasn't really anticipated then.
*  No, it wasn't then. So do you see a difference in the way that they were distributed and that
*  itself being a kind of threat rather than the content so much? That it has such more...
*  Yeah, it's different, but I think it's basically the same threat. The threat is that the public
*  will know what the government's up to. And any system of power is going to want to keep free from
*  public surveillance. That's natural. That shouldn't be, but it's very natural.
*  What's worse than that? They help shut down the sites. They refuse to let their own sites be used
*  for distributing things, or even for payment at the beginning. So yeah, I think that's a
*  kind of a contradiction, if you like. I mean, I don't think it's hard to explain. They're,
*  in both cases, supportive of U.S. government positions, pretty much.
