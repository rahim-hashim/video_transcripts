# Noam Chomsky on Climate Change
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [November 09, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHKIW-v1uB0)
*  We are living at a unique moment in the whole history of the human species.
*  Its seriousness and significance can't be underestimated.
*  You, you and your generation, are going to have to make a decision now
*  as to whether organized human life will continue on the Earth.
*  That's not an exaggeration.
*  The environmental crisis is growing.
*  It's inexorable. It's not going to stop.
*  If current tendencies continue in your lifetime, that of your children,
*  the prospects for organized human existence will radically decline.
*  This is not really controversial.
*  Take a look at any issue of the Science Journal, every issue that comes along.
*  It's more grim in forecasts.
*  We have already made this decision, incidentally, for other species.
*  The current level of species extinction due to anthropogenic global warming,
*  human-created global warming, is already at the level of what's called the fifth extinction,
*  65 million years ago, when a huge asteroid hit the Earth,
*  ended the age of the dinosaurs, opened a way for small mammals to exist,
*  ultimately us.
*  Now we're the asteroid.
*  We're killing species at the level of the asteroid 65 million years ago, and we're next.
*  It's not far off.
*  Already 300 million people, not a small number, are facing death from lack of water in India
*  after an unprecedented drought that's been going on for years.
*  It soon will be greater, soon as things happening elsewhere in the world,
*  Bolivia and other places.
*  Sea levels are predicted to rise within a few decades, not long, by maybe three to six feet.
*  That'll be a disaster for coastal cities, but much worse than that,
*  coastal plains like Bangladesh will be inundated.
*  That's hundreds of millions of people fleeing, trying desperately to survive.
*  If anyone thinks there's an immigration crisis now, just wait a couple of decades.
*  And it's plain that the rate of global warming is faster than it's been far faster,
*  hundreds of times faster than at any recorded time.
