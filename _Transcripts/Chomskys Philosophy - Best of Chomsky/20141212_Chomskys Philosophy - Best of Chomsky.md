# Noam Chomsky - Neoliberalism I
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [December 12, 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_37kR6m-Xs)
*  The term neoliberalism is a very curious one.
*  First of all, it's not liberal by any means, as we've discussed, and it's not new.
*  It was neoliberal policies or something rather like them that created the Third World.
*  If you go back to, say, the 18th century, the centers of the world economy were China, India, mostly.
*  It changed. The differences between the rich and the poor were nowhere near like today.
*  Europe grew and developed, first England, then the United States, Germany, Italy, and so on.
*  They developed by radically violating what are now called neoliberal principles, strong states, direct intervention in the economy, and so on.
*  India and later China were devastated, and the same is true of what we now call the Third World.
*  How? By imposition of, forced imposition of market principles.
*  And this is furthermore well known.
*  So if you read serious economic historians, Paul Byrosh, for example, he simply points out protectionism and state intervention created the rich and developed societies.
*  He doesn't call it neoliberalism, but forced liberalization that pretty much created the Third World.
*  It's striking to see how every element of the neoliberal package is specifically designed to undercut democracy.
*  It's rarely discussed, and people talk about its economic effects.
*  But just think it through. Let's take, say, financial liberalization core.
*  For Keynes, the greatest achievement of the Bretton Woods system, the postwar system, was to institute financial regulation.
*  And there's a reason.
*  That provides space for governments to undertake programs that are supported by the population.
*  If you have no constraints on capital flow, then you can attack currencies frequently, freely.
*  That creates what international economists sometimes call a virtual parliament of investors and lenders who can, I'm quoting from technical literature,
*  It can carry out a moment-by-moment referendum on government policies.
*  And if they think the policies are irrational, they can vote against them by capital flight or by attacks on the currencies and so on.
*  The policies that are irrational are, by definition, those that benefit people but don't improve profit and market access and so on.
*  And therefore, governments face what's called a dual constituency, their own population and the virtual parliament.
*  And the virtual parliament usually wins, especially in poor countries.
*  The rich countries sort of was modulated.
*  First of all, they didn't accept the neoliberal package as completely as, say, Latin America.
*  But to the extent that they did, the effects are predictable.
*  And the same is true of other elements of the neoliberal programs.
*  So it takes a privatization, which became a mantra.
*  Well, by definition, privatization undercuts democracy.
*  It takes something out of the public arena and puts it into the hands of unaccountable private tyrannies that are created and supported by the state, which is what corporations are.
