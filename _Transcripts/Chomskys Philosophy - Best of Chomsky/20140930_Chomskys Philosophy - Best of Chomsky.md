# Noam Chomsky on Liberalism
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [September 30, 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSgNF4vFeU)
*  Let me begin by saying something about liberalism, which is a very complicated concept.
*  I think it's correct, surely, that liberalism grew up in the intellectual environment of
*  empiricism and the rejection of authority and trust in the evidence of the senses and
*  so on.
*  However, liberalism has undergone a very complex evolution as a social philosophy over the
*  years.
*  If we go back to the classics, or at least what I regard as the classics, say for example,
*  Humboldt's Limits of State Action, which inspired Mill and is a true libertarian liberal classic,
*  if you like.
*  The world that Humboldt was considering, which was partially an imaginary world, but the
*  world for which he was developing this political philosophy, was a post-feudal but pre-capitalist
*  world.
*  That it was a world in which there is no great divergence among individuals in the kind of
*  that they have and what they command, let's say.
*  But there was a tremendous disparity between individuals on the one hand and the state
*  on the other.
*  Consequently, it was the task of a liberalism that was concerned with human rights and equality
*  of individuals and so on.
*  It was the task of that liberalism to dissolve the enormous power of the state, which was
*  such an authoritarian threat to individual liberties.
*  From that, you develop a classical liberal theory in Humboldt or Mill's sense.
*  Well, of course, that is pre-capitalist.
*  He couldn't conceive of an era in which a corporation would be regarded as individual,
*  let's say, or in which enormous disparities in control over resources and production would
*  distinguish between individuals in a massive fashion.
*  In that kind of a society, to take the Humboldtian view is a very superficial liberalism, because
*  while opposition to state power in an era of such divergence conforms to Humboldt's
*  conclusions, it doesn't do so for his reasons.
*  That is, his reasons lead to very different conclusions in that case.
*  Namely, I think his reasons lead to the conclusion that we must dissolve the authoritarian control
*  over production and resources, which leads to such divergences among individuals.
*  In fact, I think one might draw a direct line between classical liberalism and the kind
*  of libertarian socialism, which I think can be regarded as a kind of an adapting of the
*  basic reasoning of classical liberalism to a very different social era.
*  Now, if we come to the modern period, here liberalism has taken on a very strange sense,
*  if you think of its history.
*  Now liberalism is essentially the theory of state capitalism, of state intervention in
*  a capitalist economy.
*  Well, that has very little relation to classical liberalism.
*  In fact, classical liberalism is what's now called conservatism, I suppose.
*  But this new view, I think, really is, in my view, at least, a highly authoritarian
*  position.
*  That is, it's one which accepts a number of centers of authority and control, the state
*  on the one hand, agglomerations of private power on the other hand, all interacting with
*  individuals as malleable cogs in this highly constrained machine, which may be called democratic,
*  given the actual distribution of power is very far from being meaningfully democratic
*  and cannot be so.
*  So my own feeling has always been that to achieve the classical liberal ideals for the
*  reasons that led to them being put forth in a society so different, we must be led in
*  a very different direction.
*  It's superficial and erroneous to accept the conclusions which were reached for a different
*  society and not to consider the reasoning that led to those conclusions.
*  The reasoning, I think, is very substantial.
*  I'm a classical liberal in this sense, but I think it leads me to be a kind of an anarchist,
*  you know, an anarchist socialist.
