# Noam Chomsky on Watergate
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [February 24, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGIYam3p-Yc)
*  Watergate is a perfect example, we've discussed it at length in our book in fact, and elsewhere.
*  It's a perfect example of the way the press was subordinated to power.
*  But this brought down a precedent.
*  Let me give you just a minute, let's take a look.
*  What happened there, here it's kind of interesting because you can't do experiments in history,
*  but here history was kind enough to set one up for us.
*  The Watergate exposures happened to take place at exactly the same time as another set of exposures,
*  namely the exposures of Cointel Pro.
*  Oh, sorry you have to explain that.
*  It's interesting that I have to explain it because it's vastly more significant than Watergate, that already makes my point.
*  Cointel Pro was a program of subversion, carried out not by a couple of petty crooks,
*  but by the National Political Police, the FBI, under four administrations.
*  It began in the late Eisenhower administration, ran up till...
*  This is aimed at the Socialist Workers Party in America.
*  The Socialist Workers Party was one tiny fragment of it.
*  It began... by the time it got through, I won't run through the whole story,
*  it was aimed at the entire New Left, at the women's movement, at the whole black movement.
*  It was extremely broad. Its actions went as far as political assassination.
*  Now what's the difference between the two? Very clear.
*  In Watergate, Richard Nixon went after half of US private power, namely the Democratic Party,
*  and power can defend itself. So therefore that's a scandal.
*  He didn't do anything, nothing happened. Look, I was on Nixon's enemies list.
*  I didn't even know nothing ever happened.
*  Nonetheless, you wouldn't say it was an insignificant event to bring down a president.
*  No, it was a case where half of US power defended itself against a person who had obviously stepped out of line.
*  And the fact that the press thought that was important shows that they think powerful people ought to be able to defend themselves.
*  Now whether there was a question of principle involved happens to be easily checked in this case.
*  One tiny part of the Co-Intel Pro program was itself far more significant in terms of principle than all of Watergate.
*  And if you look at the whole program, I mean, it's not even a discussion, but you have to ask me what Co-Intel Pro is.
*  You know what Watergate is.
*  There couldn't be a more dramatic example of the subordination of the educated opinion to power here in England
*  as well as the United States.
