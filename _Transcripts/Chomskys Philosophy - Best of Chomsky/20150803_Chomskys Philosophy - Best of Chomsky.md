# Noam Chomsky - Our Terrorism vs. Their Terrorism
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [August 03, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lshJzfRrTY8)
*  If you're interested in terror, you should look at its causes.
*  Now if, for the point of view of apologists for state violence, like the ones you're mentioning,
*  you're not allowed to look at the causes because that's considered rationalization or justification.
*  So if you try to look for the causes like every sane person does, that's rationalization.
*  What you're supposed to do is have tantrums and scream about Islamic fascism and blame
*  it on the bad genes of the Arabs or something.
*  But you're not allowed to look at the causes, and there's a good reason for that.
*  As soon as you look at the causes, you start looking in the mirror.
*  And that you have to block.
*  You know, the main task of intellectuals always, but now too,
*  is to make sure that people never look in the mirror.
*  We never look at ourselves.
*  We only look at other people.
*  You look through hundreds of years of history.
*  The West has a virtual monopoly of violence.
*  So massive terror is the kind of thing we do to them.
*  They're not supposed to do it to us.
*  September 11th was the first break.
*  It's the first time in hundreds of years that any Western country has suffered on home soil,
*  the kind of thing they do routinely everywhere else.
*  And in Israel, it's sort of the same.
*  Actually, it was pretty striking for me to see this.
*  I mean, I had, after September 11th, I had a ton of interviews everywhere,
*  except the United States, of course.
*  And often it was national radio and TV.
*  And often, a couple of times, it turned out to be Irish and television and BBC back to back.
*  And the difference in reaction was startling.
*  I mean, things like things that I said this much on Irish TV,
*  okay, discussion over, everyone understands what I'm talking about.
*  I try to say it on BBC.
*  You have to go on for like about an hour to explain to them what you mean.
*  The Irish Sea is a chasm, you know, and it just depends who's been holding a whip for 800 years
*  and who's been under it for 800 years.
*  And the same is true everywhere else in the world, you know.
*  But for the West, the idea that anybody should do to us a fraction of what we regularly do to them
*  is just outrageous, you know.
*  And the same is true in Israel.
*  It's a 35-year occupation.
*  And up until very recently, they were immune, literally immune from retaliation
*  from within the territories.
*  And they weren't acting very nicely there.
*  It was brutal, you know, humiliating, repressive, robbing the resources,
*  kicking the people out and so on.
*  But there was no retaliation, okay.
*  Last year or two, there's some retaliation.
*  So it's scandalous.
*  It's also considered a scandal in the West, right.
*  Because we do it to them, it's okay.
*  But they do it to us, it's not okay.
*  So if Israel invades Lebanon with U.S. backing and kills 20,000 people,
*  it's the way the cookie crumbles.
*  It's not a problem.
*  But if it goes the other direction, a couple of people get killed,
*  yeah, that's a horror story.
*  September 11th, it was immediately predicted,
*  and now we can look back and see that the prediction was correct,
*  that every repressive force in the world would take it as a window of opportunity
*  to extend what they were doing.
*  So, for example, the Russians took it as an opportunity
*  to extend the attack in Chechnya,
*  pretending that it's a war on terror, and now with the authorization of Washington.
*  The Chinese did the same in Western China.
*  Indonesia did the same in Aceh,
*  Israel in the occupied territories, and so on down the list.
*  Furthermore, just about every government used it as an opportunity
*  to try to impose greater discipline on their own populations,
*  under, again, the pretext of a war on terror.
*  So that's true of the more dictatorial states, like, say, Central Asia.
*  It's also true of the more democratic societies
*  with prevention of terrorism ordinances and other devices of one sort or another,
*  mainly to try to discipline their own populations.
*  These are just continuations of tendencies that are already in process,
*  using this kind of opportunity to escalate it.
*  And that was predictable, and of course it's happened.
