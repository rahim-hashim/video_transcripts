# Noam Chomsky - Humanitarian Intent
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [September 10, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syikF6gNJDk)
*  As to what the goals were, of course, they're professed to be completely humanitarian,
*  but it's worth remembering that when a state claims, not only a state, but its intellectual
*  class and others, when they claim to be acting on humanitarian grounds, that statement in
*  the technical sense carries zero information.
*  And the reason is it's completely predictable.
*  It happens all the time.
*  I gave a couple of examples, you know, Hitler, Mussolini, John Stuart Mill, Pickham.
*  Just about every use of force is vested in noble humanitarian terms.
*  If something's predictable, it just doesn't carry any information, so you disregard it.
*  You dismiss it.
*  It doesn't mean anything.
*  So then you have to ask, was it really with humanitarian intent?
*  Well, there you have to judge.
