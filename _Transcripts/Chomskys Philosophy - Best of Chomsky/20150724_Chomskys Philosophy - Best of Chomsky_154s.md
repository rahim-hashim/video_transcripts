# Noam Chomsky - Leaders
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [July 24, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnLYXNo5Lj8)
*  Suppose somebody has a good idea.
*  Suppose we're trying to organize something and you have a good idea.
*  Okay then for that, and we think yeah that's a great idea, okay for that moment you're
*  a leader.
*  Okay maybe tomorrow he has a good idea so he'll be the leader.
*  If we designate somebody to be the leader, we're going to follow them no matter what
*  they say, then we're in trouble.
*  If you want to look up to people, you should look up to say the snake workers.
*  People are really doing the work in the south.
*  They had hard, bitter experiences, not just them but plenty of black activists and others,
*  some white people joined them.
*  That's what you should really look up to.
*  As soon as you start worshiping leaders, you're in trouble.
*  Why?
*  Because they're going to take power and institute systems of authority and domination, which
*  are after its freedom and independence.
*  Leaders should be representatives of the community, temporarily given positions of
*  degree of authority under popular control.
*  Take Martin Luther King, who was a very important figure.
*  But he was kind of riding a wave of popular activism if it hadn't been for snake workers
*  and freedom riders and black students sitting in at lunch counters and mass public demonstrations.
*  There would be no Martin Luther King.
*  I mean, there'd be a king, but nobody would be listening to him.
*  What he did was recognize to be dangerous by power systems.
*  If you take a look at the history of how King is regarded and treated, it's very illuminating.
*  On Martin Luther King Day, there's lots of elaborate rhetoric, which typically ends in
*  1963 with, you know, I have a dream.
*  Because that's kind of tolerable to systems of power and domination.
*  Maybe they don't particularly like it, but they can accept it.
*  On the other hand, what about what he did right after that?
*  Poor People's Movement.
*  Organizing a going to work to support a sanitation workers strike.
*  That's not there.
*  In fact, he gave another I have a dream speech the night before he was assassinated.
*  But that's not quoted.
