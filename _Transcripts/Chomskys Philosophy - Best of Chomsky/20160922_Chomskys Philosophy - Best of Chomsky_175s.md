# Noam Chomsky - Universal Grammar I
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [September 22, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxWE3i7_vmQ)
*  In advance of experience, the child is already equipped with an understanding of the basic
*  structure of any human language. So we know even in advance of inquiry that there's going
*  to be a fundamental invariant core to language. Linguists have come to use the term universal
*  grammar. It's a notion that there's some underlying set of characteristics that are true of all
*  languages all over the world. All human languages have something that is sort of noun-y and something
*  that is sort of verbi. They all do. All human languages have a way to make things negative.
*  No way Jose! No way Jose! All human languages have a way to ask a question. If I'm asking a question,
*  I'll lower my eyebrows. Where are you from? What's your name? Who is that person? All human languages
*  have a way to indicate a difference between just one and more than one. In the Eskimo languages,
*  you have not only the singular, for example, ugaik, one rabbit, ugaik, two rabbits, ugaik,
*  three or more rabbits. And so it goes. Each language has a list of obligatory distinctions,
*  male, female, definite, indefinite, singular, plural, past, present. This is the stock of
*  categories that the human mind uses to schematize experience. And Chomsky asked the question,
*  why is this? Why are languages so similar? Why are they all cut from the same mold?
*  And his answer was, there are fixed invariant principles, fixed invariant structural principles,
*  which are simply part of the human biological endowment and that determine what counts as a
*  human language. It's because the human brain is pre-wired to accept only certain kinds of languages
*  and that the grammatical properties of the languages of the world have those properties
*  that they do because the human mind has those properties. Those things which are true of all
*  languages are the candidates for what the child comes into the world knowing about the nature
*  of the language to which he is being exposed. The child might very well have a plan for what is a
*  possible rule in a human language. So languages can have verbs then objects or objects then verbs,
*  but those are two possibilities that every language has one or the other of. And the child
*  can simply worry about which of those two versions his language has. What he's got to pick up are the
*  particular versions of the rules that everyone else in the community is using.
