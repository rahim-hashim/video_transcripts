# Noam Chomsky on Behaviorism
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [March 27, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrQ0LfqxABM)
*  I was just wondering how much of an effect do you think behaviorism has had on the
*  continued question of the existence of language the
*  Continued question about whether or not language exists. Oh
*  Understood that overwhelming impact. Yes, the behaviors and can't die
*  It doesn't matter how often it's refuted and how fully it's refuted it comes right back to life
*  It's kind of like genetic somehow. Actually, I was taught just in Toronto. I was in Toronto a couple days ago
*  I was talking to a very
*  outstanding
*  Neuroscience link neuro linguist who works on these done a lot of the work on these topics
*  And she was telling me not not as a joke about what happens in her introductory courses
*  She teaches language acquisition
*  In her introductory language acquisition courses the first day
*  She asks kids to say you know how's language acquired. She's about a hundred percent say reinforcement and association
*  Yeah, I mean it's you know, I mean it's been refuted so overwhelmingly that
*  You don't know what to say about it, but you're absolutely right it keeps coming back and it's at the core of these
*  Computational cognitive science approaches they don't call it behaviorism anymore
*  But it's sort of the same idea actually behaviorism in any serious sense
*  collapsed in the early 60s just for internal reasons, I
*  Mean the you know it
*  There were interesting things that happened that essentially wiped it out. So for example one are you a psychologist?
*  You know, you know this well if those of your psychologists ought to know that a
*  Lot of the stuff's been forgotten, you know, because people forget everything it didn't that isn't on the internet, but it's
*  back around early 60s
*  There was a very interesting paper in psych review, you know main psychological journal by Keller and Nancy Breland
*  their
*  Skinner's two main students, you know the most loyal
*  Orthodox students they assumed like everybody that the game's all over. There's no point studying anything anymore
*  Everything's answered. So they went off into animal training and in fact
*  They're the ones who trained all the famous animals like, you know flipper the dolphin and all the things that my kids watched
*  I don't know what you watch but
*  And they discovered something
*  They discovered that when they were training an animal they got the expected results
*  Up to a certain point and then the results started to deteriorate
*  So for example if they were one case they were training a pig to pick up a coin and
*  put it in a
*  mail slot and you know to get a whatever pigs like
*  Reinforced by some food and according to the story the pig is supposed to
*  Improve its behavior, you know, don't do any other things just go more and more right to the coin put it right in don't waste any time
*  You get reinforced and that worked up to a point
*  but then after that point it turned out that the pigs started rooting at the coin and
*  Delaying the reinforcement and would continue to do it up to the point where it starved
*  Well, what was happening is what they called instinctual drift
*  Pigs root, you know, that's what they are and they were interpreting this whole coin business
*  Some crazy thing that the experimenter made up that's just some funny kind of rooting and
*  They then over time went back to their rooting
*  Well, then they started looking at all the experiments in the lab
*  It turned out the experiments are always terminated when this begins to happen
*  so you get a smooth learning curve and then things start to go haywire, so you stop the experiment and
*  Say the Skinner experiments were pigeons pecking well, it turns out there's two kinds of pecking
*  Pigeons peck for corn and they also pick for water and they look kind of alike
*  but they're different kinds of pecking and the things that the
*  Pigeons were able to be trained on actually were adaptations of one or the other of these kinds of pecking
*  You tried to get the pigeons do something else you get nowhere
*  But if you kind of modify their instinctive behavior slightly you can sort of fool yourself into thinking you're getting results
*  But before too long the animal takes over and it's doing what it was doing. So it kind of wiped out the whole field
*  later work in the mid 60s already began to discover that I
*  Mean, I remember this happening. I was involved in it
*  but I remember once gave a talk at University of Illinois or somewhere there's a strict behaviors department and
*  You know talk kind of like this 50 years ago so different but same idea saying that you can't get anywhere with
*  Conditioning and reinforcement for the human behavior. So one of the guy got up a very good
*  Behavioral animal psychologist and said how do you know it works for animals?
*  So I said, I don't know you guys say it works for animals. I suppose you're right and
*  His name is Bill Brewer and he got interested and he started
*  Redoing the animal experiments and he started publishing some papers and it turned out that
*  The animals are getting reinforced only when they're aware of what's happening
*  If you set up the experiment you can do some sophisticated experiments that distinguish
*  cases where the animal doesn't know what's going on and then it doesn't get any reinforcement and reinforcement doesn't do anything and
*  Other cases where the animal sort of sees what's going on it gets reinforced
*  So his conclusion and others too was this is just information transmission, you know, it's a reinforcement experiments are an odd way of
*  Providing the animal with information. I mean you can't tell them peck when you I tell you to so you do it this other way
*  and there's more work that did that but by the
*  In more recent times, it's not even evident that conditioning exists
*  And there is work again Randy Gallistle and others who've argued that it's all an artifact
*  It's just the various ways of estimating valuable values of variables and the whole thing kind of collapses
*  But it doesn't matter. You're exactly right. No matter how much it's refuted. It's right back the next day
