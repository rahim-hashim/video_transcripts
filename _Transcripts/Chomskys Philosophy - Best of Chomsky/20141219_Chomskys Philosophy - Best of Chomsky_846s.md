# Noam Chomsky on Corporations
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [December 19, 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5obtpWrFKjU)
*  The major institutions in the society are under totalitarian control.
*  After all, what's a corporation?
*  A corporation is just a tyrannical system, one of the most tyrannical systems that humans have ever devised.
*  They've been given extraordinary rights by the courts, not by legislation, early in this century.
*  They're, like the multilateral agreement, we give them actually the rights of states.
*  They're basically unaccountable to the public.
*  When they've been given the rights of persons, that means, for example, they have the right to propagandize.
*  So, like, they've been given the rights of free speech, which is insane.
*  These are collectivist institutions.
*  They've been given the right to advertise, in fact, at your expense.
*  So you get the tax free, so you pay for the privilege of having your minds destroyed.
*  And they own the information system.
*  They control the information system.
*  What are the media? Huge corporations, parts of bigger corporations.
*  That sets the framework of discussion.
*  The major decisions that affect what happens in the economy and social life are made behind closed doors.
*  Very little public accountability.
*  They have the right freedom from search and seizure.
*  Fourth Amendment rights means you can't know anything about what they're doing.
*  And they have enormous power.
*  Furthermore, I mean, it's described as free trade. It's ridiculous.
*  I mean, these are secret institutions, so all figures have to be taken with a big grain of salt, because nobody really knows.
*  But the guesses are that by international economists, maybe 40% or so of U.S. trade is actually internal to corporations.
*  Meaning it's not trade at all.
*  It's just moving something across a border.
*  It's no more trade than moving from Indiana to Illinois or something like that.
*  It happens across a border to get cheaper labor, to avoid environmental restrictions and so on.
*  Well, 40% is not a small number.
*  And that's a vast underestimate, because there are also complicated strategic alliances among alleged competitors.
*  So IBM and Toshiba and Siemens and so on are working together.
*  They're working together on design, on marketing and so on.
*  And in fact, it's gotten to the point where some international economists call it a new system of what they call alliance capitalism.
*  You know, big networks of tyrannical institutions basically running the world.
*  Outsourcing is one of the operations that take place within command economies.
*  The country, the economy is run by a network of command economies called corporations.
*  I mean, what goes on internal to a corporation or a megacorporation is not free trade.
*  It's command economy at corporations, a totalitarian institution.
*  You know, it has a board of directors at the top, a manager who gives orders.
*  Everyone follows them down at the bottom.
*  At the very bottom, if you're lucky, you can rent yourself to it and get a job.
*  And if you're sufficiently propagandized, you may even buy some of the junk they produce and so on.
*  But it certainly has nothing to do with what any classical economist would have called a free market.
*  Outsourcing is just part of the technique. Outsourcing is internal to the corporation.
*  The corporation picks some supplier to outsource to and keeps them under control because then they can get much cheaper labor, hideous working conditions.
*  Don't have to worry about environmental controls.
*  They get inputs to themselves, which are very cheap.
*  That increase, for those of you who have studied economics, you know that that increases productivity.
*  If you get artificially cheap inputs, that increases productivity because productivity is measured in terms of value produced, divided by the number of workers.
*  So you get nice measures of productivity, which have nothing to do with productivity.
*  They just have to do with the fact that you've got 20-year-old women off the farms in China locked in the factories and working until they die in a couple of years.
*  That is very healthy for the economy.
*  But it's all internal to big command economies.
*  That's one of the reasons why the concept trade is so ridiculous.
*  I mean, what's called trade would certainly not have been called trade by Adam Smith.
*  Like, you know, outsourcing happens to send goods across the border into the United States, but it's under the control of a command economy.
*  In fact, the network of command economies, which work the way I just quoted, you know, the oligopolistic competition and strategic integration.
*  And the same is true of most of what's called trade.
*  I mean, we don't have – nobody really studies this much, so you don't have really accurate numbers.
*  But if you take the numbers that are guessed at by economists who look at it, take, say, NAFTA.
*  One of the great things about NAFTA is supposed to have been that it increased trade between the U.S. and Mexico.
*  Well, it certainly increased cross-border transfers of material objects.
*  But is that trade?
*  Well, it depends, you know.
*  It turns out that the percentage of interaction that's intra-firm, internal to a command economy,
*  went from about 50 percent before NAFTA to about two-thirds after NAFTA.
*  That's not trade any more than if GM shifts something from Indiana to Illinois.
*  You know, it happens across an international border so that you can take advantage of rotten working conditions
*  and low wages and no environmental constraints, but it's no more trade than if the Kremlin
*  moved something from, you know, Poland to Hungary or something like that.
*  It's – and in fact, it's very possible, if anybody ever bothered to study it,
*  that actual trade has even declined since NAFTA.
*  I mean, nobody studies it because it's the wrong questions to ask, you know,
*  and it's not in the ideological framework that we're supposed to accept.
*  But if you did ask it, you might very well find that, just as it turns out after NAFTA that –
*  and, you know, another great thing about NAFTA for Mexico is that foreign investment shot up, which it did.
*  But a little footnote is that total investment declined because Mexican investment declined even faster
*  than foreign investment went up for the simple reason that Mexican businesses can't compete
*  with highly subsidized U.S. corporate systems.
*  As for regulating corporations, there's very little in the way of international law on that.
*  That's mostly – I mean, it's mostly the responsibility of the states in which the corporations are technically located.
*  And you're right, there's a very weak regulatory apparatus, and the reasons are not a deep secret.
*  It's that the states and corporations are very tightly linked.
*  To a very large extent, concentrated private power just dominates the state, in fact, even staffs it,
*  so they're very unlikely to regulate it.
*  And it sets the constraints in which state policy is made.
*  Well, that shouldn't be true.
*  There should – again, democratization of societies would reduce that.
*  In fact, in my opinion, corporations are themselves illegitimate.
*  I take a very conservative position on this.
*  As you may know, when the modern corporation was created about a century ago by state intervention,
*  mostly judicial intervention, there wasn't no legislation about it.
*  But when corporate law in the current sense was established in the early 20th century by the courts,
*  there were people who bitterly opposed it, namely conservatives.
*  There used to be conservatives in those days, now the term is around, but not the concept.
*  Conservatives bitterly condemned it as a return to feudalism, which in a way it was, and a form of communism.
*  Now, that was the reaction to the radical revision of corporate law in the United States and elsewhere
*  to grant corporations, collectivist legal entities, the rights of people of flesh and blood.
*  As a major attack against classical liberal principles and conservatives, meaning classical liberals,
*  were bitterly offended by that, and I think they had a good point.
*  Well, since that time, it's gotten a lot worse.
*  The decisions, if you look through corporate law, it has, I'll talk about the United States,
*  but it's not very different elsewhere, major decisions about 80 years ago, 90 years ago by the courts,
*  determined that corporations are not only persons, but they are necessarily pathological persons.
*  That is, they determined that a corporation, the corporate management must dedicate itself
*  to increasing profit and market share, whatever the effect on anyone.
*  For a corporation to do anything benevolent was determined to be illegal.
*  That was the issue that came up. I'll go through the court case if you like.
*  It's been fortified by further corporate law, mostly in the courts, not legislation.
*  The corporations are allowed to do something benevolent if the TV cameras are on.
*  So if you're doing it for public relations purposes, then you're allowed to do something nice.
*  In fact, the courts have gone so far as to advise corporations that they should carry out benign acts,
*  or else, I'm now quoting, an aroused public may discover what you're up to and what the government is up to
*  and take away your privileges.
*  So you better do nice things to prevent an aroused public to find out what's going on.
*  In the recent international trade agreements, which do provide a kind of a framework for corporate behavior,
*  corporations are given rights that go way beyond persons.
*  So if General Motors, let's say, invests in Mexico, they can demand what's called national treatment.
*  They have to be treated like some Mexican mom-and-pop business.
*  If a Mexican of flesh and blood comes to New York and asks for national treatment,
*  he'll be lucky if he's not sent to Guantanamo.
*  The reason is that private tyrannies, collectivist private tyrannies, legally created entities,
*  are given rights way beyond persons by the so-called trade agreements, which not much to do with trade,
*  certainly not with free trade.
*  Well, you know, all of that can be changed.
*  Private tyrannies? What do you mean by private?
*  Yeah, corporations are private tyranny.
*  The corporation, if you look at its structure, is about as close to the totalitarian model
*  as anything that human beings have created.
*  Manage control is completely from top down.
*  You can be inserted in the middle somewhere, like a junior manager, take orders from the top,
*  you hand them down below.
*  At the very bottom, people are allowed to rent themselves to it.
*  It's called getting a job.
*  And there's a very weak accountability to the public, extremely weak.
*  And when you get, you know, when the right wing comes into power,
*  like the Reagan administration or the Bush administration,
*  their primary goal is to weaken the regulatory apparatus.
*  So the Reagan administration, for example, essentially informed the corporate world
*  that they were not going to enforce the regulations on business practices.
*  You can read all about it in Businessweek, which had good reports about it,
*  and described how the number of illegal firings of union organizers, I think,
*  tripled, shot up, and other labor abuses shot up,
*  because the government simply said, we're not going to enforce the law,
*  so do what you like. And they did what they liked.
*  So yes, there's a very real question about the legitimacy of the institution in the first place.
*  But insofar as it exists, and again, let me stress,
*  I'm thinking of a very conservative position on this, that is the position,
*  was the position of conservatives when they did really exist, with justice.
*  So that's a serious question. But if they exist, yeah, they should be accountable to the public.
*  And that means in many respects. For example, there's no, you know,
*  it's not a law of nature that they should work for the benefit of shareholders.
*  And shareholders doesn't mean somebody who has $5 in a mutual fund.
*  Corporate ownership is very highly concentrated.
*  The top 1% of the population probably holds about half of it.
*  So there's no law that says that they should, there happened to be a law,
*  but there shouldn't be one, not a justifiable law, that says that they should work for the benefit
*  of the tiny percentage of the population that happens to own the country.
*  And that's a plan for what are called stakeholders, meaning the community, the workforce,
*  future generations because of the effects they have on environment and so on.
*  Yeah, those are reasonable proposals.
*  And there's no reason why a democratic society should enforce them.
