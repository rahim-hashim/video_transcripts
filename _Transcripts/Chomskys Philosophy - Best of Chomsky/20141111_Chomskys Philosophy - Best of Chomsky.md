# Noam Chomsky on Capitalism
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [November 11, 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FHNMZbnvYU)
*  In your view, what's wrong with private ownership of the means of production?
*  We should not have relations of hierarchy, dominance, subordination, centralized control
*  over the means of life, people who give orders.
*  Private ownership applies to all that?
*  Yeah.
*  If you have private ownership of the means of production, it means that first of all,
*  it's not just one person.
*  It's an institution, so you get like maybe it's a corporation or private business or
*  something.
*  First of all, internally, it's essentially a totalitarian institution, almost necessarily.
*  There's a group at the top, maybe a person or a group.
*  They make the decisions.
*  They give orders.
*  People down the hierarchy get the orders, transmit them.
*  At the very bottom, you get people who are permitted to rent themselves to survive.
*  That's called a job, a wage laborer.
*  And you get the outside community who's allowed to purchase what you produce.
*  And of course, they're very heavily propagandized to make them want to consume it even if they
*  don't.
*  So that's the nature of the system.
*  It's kind of about as close to totalitarianism as you can imagine.
*  That enterprise works just the way Milton Friedman says.
*  You give the worst possible service at the highest possible profit.
*  That's what it means to be in the business.
*  If you try to be benevolent, you're out of the business because somebody undercuts you.
*  So the nature of the system is, insight goes way back to Adam Smith, is to be as mean and
*  rotten as you can to try to maximize profit and market share and give the worst possible
*  service, same with HMOs and everything else.
*  The system has unacceptable risk built into it.
*  It's well known among economists that markets are inefficient from the narrowest perspective.
*  So to make it simple, suppose you and I, suppose you sell me a car, okay?
*  We may make a good deal for ourselves.
*  We're not taking into account the effect on him.
*  That's what's called an externality.
*  And there's an effect.
*  If you sell me a car, it increases gas prices, increases pollution, increases congestion,
*  and that extends very broadly.
*  These so-called externalities can be very large.
*  Now, in financial institutions, it's far worse.
*  They're in the business of taking risks.
*  If they're well managed, they calculate the potential cost to themselves if there's a
*  The important words are to themselves.
*  They don't calculate in what's called systemic risk, the effect on the whole system if I
*  make, if I go bust, you know, and it's a huge effect.
*  The result is that risk taking is underpriced, meaning there's a lot more of it than there
*  would be in a reasonable system.
*  In your role as CEO of a corporation, you are compelled to maximize profit and to ignore
*  what economists call externalities.
*  That is the impact of your transactions on others.
*  Well, that's why we have repeated financial crises ever since Reagan and Thatcher.
*  The deregulation of the financial institutions means that the people who run them have to
*  ignore what's called systemic risk, the risk that a transaction is going to bring down
*  the system.
*  And since you ignore it, you're increasing the probability of it and therefore it repeatedly
*  happens.
*  So we repeatedly have financial crises, each one worse than the last.
*  Markets are supposed to be magnificent because they increase your choices.
*  Actually, they restrict your choices.
*  Let me think about it for a minute.
*  Suppose I want to get home from work at night.
*  The market offers me a choice.
*  I can have a Ford or a Toyota.
*  It does not offer me the choice of a subway.
*  What I want, what's good for me, what's good for the environment, what's good for my children,
*  but that's not offered in the market.
*  Markets offer individual consumption.
*  And the enormous stress on the importance of markets is part of the way to drive people
*  towards looking for yourself, amassing as many commodities as you can, forget everything
*  else.
*  In fact, if you think about it, every one of you has taken an economics course or read
*  about it, then you know what markets are supposed to be.
*  Markets are supposed to be systems in which informed consumers make rational choices,
*  right?
*  I'm sure every one of you has turned on a television set.
*  What you see when you turn on a television set, you see that there's a huge industry,
*  public relations industry, which began in the United States and Britain, incidentally,
*  huge industry, which is designed to undermine markets.
*  Every ad is an attempt to create an uninformed consumer who will make an irrational choice,
*  right?
*  Huge effort on the part of the business world to undermine markets, but to keep the aspect
*  that's useful for profit and power, namely separating people from one another, focusing
*  on individual choices, not working with your neighbor.
*  By now, about close to half the stock is owned by about 1% of the population, and the bottom
*  80% of the population hold about 4% of the stock.
*  And the corporations are interlinked, like a bank alone, a big piece of one corporation.
*  I mean, it's a massive system of highly concentrated power, given the rights of immortal persons,
*  but without the responsibility of persons.
*  These are amoral institutions.
*  In fact, there are private tyrannies, which are amoral and required to be amoral.
*  So they want to avoid monopoly, because then they get public service requirements, but
*  they want to be very limited.
*  So just a few of them, which can have what are called strategic alliances, they can effectively
*  act together.
