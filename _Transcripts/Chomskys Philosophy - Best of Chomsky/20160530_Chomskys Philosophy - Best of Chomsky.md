# Noam Chomsky - Mysterianism, Language, and Human Understanding
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [May 30, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-E0IEyS4qw)
*  There is a concept called the new Mysterionism,
*  it was coined by philosopher Owen Flanagan,
*  who defined it as a postmodern position designed to drive a railroad spike
*  through the heart of scientism by holding that consciousness may never be completely explained.
*  And the term has been extended to broader questions
*  about the scope and nature of explanations accessible to human intelligence.
*  I'll use the term in the broader sense, which seems to be the more significant one.
*  Actually, I'm cited as one of the culprits responsible for this strange postmodern heresy,
*  which I happily accept, though I would prefer a different term for it, namely truism.
*  That's what I thought 40 years ago in proposing a distinction between problems
*  which fall within our cognitive capacities, maybe very hard, but in principle fall within them,
*  and mysteries which do not fall within them at all.
*  I was borrowing terms from Charles Sanders Peirce's account of what he called abduction,
*  the concept in his words that the human mind is a biological system
*  that provides the mind with certain admissible hypotheses,
*  which are the foundations of human knowledge and of science,
*  and then as a matter of simple logic, these must exclude others that are inaccessible to us altogether,
*  or perhaps too remote on some accessibility hierarchy to be accessible in fact,
*  although they might be for a differently structured mind.
*  Peirce's abduction is sometimes interpreted in the philosophical literature
*  as inference to the best explanation, but that's not quite accurate.
*  Crucially, Peirce insisted on what he called the limits of admissible hypotheses,
*  which he took to be quite narrow for quite good reasons,
*  and to be a prerequisite for, in his words, imagining correct theories.
*  Now, Peirce was concerned with the growth of scientific knowledge,
*  but the same logic holds for acquisition of common sense understanding.
*  All of this does seem to me close to truism,
*  if not necessarily for the reasons that have led many distinguished figures over the centuries
*  to somewhat similar conclusions.
*  The reason it's truism is that if we are biological organisms, not angels,
*  then our cognitive faculties are similar to those that are called physical capacities,
*  and they should be studied much as other systems of the body are.
*  These truisms, and that's what they are, are commonly rejected in the study of mental faculties,
*  language in particular.
*  That seems to be one instance of a curious tendency to treat mental aspects of the human organism
*  differently from so-called physical aspects.
*  It's a kind of methodological dualism, which is much more pernicious than Cartesian metaphysical dualism.
*  The latter was a respectable scientific hypothesis, proven wrong,
*  as respectable scientific hypotheses regularly are,
*  proven wrong when Newton demonstrated, a few years later,
*  that one of the two substances that Descartes had postulated doesn't exist, namely body.
*  Newton demonstrated that there are no machines that undermine what was called the mechanical philosophy,
*  mechanical science, which was the foundations of early modern science from Galileo on.
*  By doing so, by eliminating the concept of body, physical, mechanical, and so on,
*  Newton also eliminated the mind-body problem, at least in its Cartesian form.
*  Methodological dualism, in contrast, has absolutely nothing to recommend it.
*  If that's true, I think it is, then Mysterionism is indeed just a variety of truism,
*  along with what's called internalism.
*  This is contrary to views widely held, as philosophers among you will know.
*  Well, as David Hume put the matter not long after, I'll quote him,
*  We must keep to the Newtonian philosophy with a modest skepticism to a certain degree,
*  and with a fair confession of ignorance in subjects that exceed all human capacity,
*  and for Hume that includes virtually everything beyond appearances.
*  We must, he said, refrain from disquisitions concerning their real nature and operations.
*  It is the imagination, a kind of magical faculty in the soul, which is inexplicable
*  by the utmost efforts of human understanding.
*  We can't possibly comprehend it, and it's that mystical system, magical system,
*  that leads us to believe that we experience external continuing objects,
*  so-called physical or so-called mind and self.
*  Well, all of this is thoroughgoing Mysterionism.
*  That would include the quandaries that were considered to be the hard problems
*  in the early days of modern science and philosophy in the 17th and 18th century.
*  The most troublesome of the hard problems in that era had to do with the nature of motion,
*  of attraction and repulsion.
*  The problems, incidentally, that were never solved but were rather abandoned
*  and so understood by the more perceptive observers,
*  like John Locke and David Hume, recognized to be permanent mysteries,
*  at least mysteries for humans.
*  Some other structured intelligence might see things differently.
*  That was incidentally well understood at the time, forgotten now,
*  but well understood in those days.
*  So Locke wrote that, in his words,
*  about matter and its effects, and no science of bodies that provides true explanations
*  is within our reach.
*  Nevertheless, he says, he was convinced by the judicious Mr. Newton's
*  incomparable book, Principia, that it's too bold a presumption
*  to limit God's power in this point by my narrow conceptions.
*  So the gravitation of matter to matter is, Locke wrote, inconceivable to me as it was to Newton.
*  And nevertheless, as Newton demonstrated, we must recognize that it is within God's power
*  to put into bodies powers and ways of operations above what can be derived from our idea of body
*  or can be explained by what we can know of matter.
*  And thanks to Newton's work, we know that he has done so.
*  Given the mysterious truisms, what is inconceivable to us is no criterion for what can exist.
*  And Newton agreed, in his constant search for some way to avoid what he called
*  the absurd conclusion that objects interact at a distance,
*  he speculated that God, who is everywhere, might be the immaterial agent
*  implementing gravitational interactions.
*  But he could go no further, since in his famous phrase, he would not feign hypotheses
*  beyond what could be experimentally established.
*  So he left it as a mystery.
*  And Newton agreed with his most eminent critic, Leibniz,
*  that interaction without contact is inconceivable,
*  although he did not agree that divine intervention, his only explanation,
*  would leave such attraction as, in his words, an unaccountable, an unreasonable occult property.
*  It's referring back to debates about neo-scholasticism.
*  Well, accordingly, the goals of scientific inquiry were implicitly restricted
*  from the intelligibility of nature, which was, in fact, the criterion for true understanding
*  in early modern science, Galilean science and its successors,
*  restricted, abandoned that and moved to something much narrower,
*  intelligibility of theories about the world.
*  It's quite a different concept.
*  That seems to me a step of considerable significance in the history of human thought and inquiry,
*  much more so than is generally recognized.
*  It's been kind of assimilated into the scientific common sense of the subsequent period
*  without recognition of how much of early modern science was simply abandoned as beyond our capacities.
*  This bears directly on the scope of Mysterianism in the broad sense.
*  John Locke went on to conclude that just as God had added to matter
*  such inconceivable properties as gravitational attraction,
*  he might also have super added to matter a capacity of thought.
*  If we replace God by nature, that opens the way to inquiry,
*  a path that was in fact pursued extensively in the years that followed right through the 18th century,
*  leading to the conclusion that thought is simply a property of certain forms of organized matter.
*  Darwin restated the fairly common 18th century understanding by saying that
*  there is no need to regard thought, a secretion of the brain, as more wonderful than gravity,
*  a property of matter, inconceivable to us, but that's a fact about our cognitive limitations,
*  not about the nature of the world.
*  Some of the early modern understanding of these matters, Newton through Darwin,
*  some of it has been rediscovered in very recent years, sometimes with a sense of wonderment.
*  For example, Francis Crick formulated what he called his astonishing hypothesis
*  that our mental and emotional states are in fact no more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells
*  and their associated molecules.
*  In the philosophical literature, this rediscovery has sometimes been described as a radical new idea in the study of mind.
*  I'm quoting, as Paul Churchlin puts it, quoting John Searle,
*  the new idea is the bold assertion that mental phenomena are entirely natural
*  and caused by the neurophysiological properties, activities of the brain.
*  These proposals restate in virtually the same words the formulations of centuries ago,
*  which have been forgotten, after the traditional mind-body problem became unformulable
*  with the disappearance of the only coherent notion of body or physical or material and so on.
*  For example, Joseph Priestley's conclusion at the end of the 18th century that properties termed mental
*  reduced to the organical structure of the brain,
*  a concept stated in different words by Locke, Darwin, and many others,
*  almost inescapable it would seem after the collapse of the mechanical philosophy
*  which provided the foundations for early modern science.
*  The last decade of the 20th century was designated as the decade of the brain.
*  There's a collection of essays reviewing the results published by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,
*  and it contains an introduction by a distinguished neuroscientist, Vernon Mountcastle.
*  He formulates the guiding theme as, in his words,
*  the thesis of the new biology that things mental, indeed minds, are emergent properties of brains,
*  though these emergencies are produced by principles that we do not yet understand.
*  Once again, reiterating 18th century observations in virtually the same words.
*  The phrase we do not yet understand, however, should strike a note of caution.
*  We might remember Bertrand Russell's observation in 1927, the year's important,
*  that chemical laws cannot at present be reduced to physical laws.
*  That was a fact, and it was a fact that led many eminent scientists, including Nobel laureates,
*  to regard chemistry as not really a science, but just a mode of computation
*  that for some reason could predict experimental results, but not real science, because it couldn't be reduced to physics.
*  As soon was discovered, Russell's observation, though correct, was understated.
*  Chemical laws were indeed not reducible to physical laws, as physics was then understood,
*  and remained irreducible, and still are, though after physics underwent radical changes
*  with the quantum theoretic revolution, which was just taking place at that time,
*  the new physics, entirely different physics, was unified with a virtually unchanged chemistry.
*  Chemistry was never reduced to physics. It was irreducible to physics.
*  Physics changed and unified with an unchanged chemistry.
*  There may be lessons here, I think there are, for neuroscience and philosophy of mind.
*  So contemporary neuroscience is nowhere near as well established as physics was a century ago.
*  In fact, there are what seem to me quite cogent critiques of its foundational assumptions.
*  Recently, in an important book by Gallistone King, to define cognitive neuroscientists,
*  the common slogan that study of mind is neuroscience at an abstract level,
*  it might prove to be just as misleading as comparable statements about chemistry 90 years ago.
*  It doesn't sound too long ago to me when I was a child that chemistry and physics were finally unified
*  with Linus Pauling's discovery of a quantum theoretic basis for the chemical bond.
*  Well, returning to the impact of Newton's discoveries, his greatest achievement,
*  David Hume wrote, was to draw the veil from some of the mysteries of nature
*  while also restoring nature's ultimate secrets to that obscurity in which they ever did and ever will remain.
*  We may add, for humans at least, other forms of intelligence might view the world quite differently.
*  All of this is dedicated mysterioism for very substantial reasons,
*  including the leading figures of our intellectual, scientific, philosophical tradition.
*  Well, as regards consciousness, it entered modern philosophy, philosophical discourse, at about the same time.
*  There's a recent comprehensive scholarly study of this range of topics by Udo Thiel,
*  a kind of gold standard in the field.
*  He points out that the first English philosopher to make extensive use of the noun consciousness
*  with a philosophical meaning was Ralph Cudworth in the 1670s,
*  although it was not until 50 years later that consciousness became an object of inquiry in its own right.
*  And subsequently, consciousness was identified with thought, as in fact it already had been by Descartes.
*  And for some, like Wilhelm von Humboldt, a great linguist, thought was further identified with language,
*  which provides the language of thought, modern phrase, but same idea,
*  ideas that can be partially reconstructed in contemporary terms.
*  Well, in the modern period, identification of thought with consciousness reappears in various ways.
*  For example, in Quine's thesis that rule following reduces either to fitting as the planets fit Kepler's laws
*  or by guiding by conscious thought, only two kinds.
*  John Searle's connection principle holds that operations of the mind must be somehow accessible to conscious experience.
*  It's actually an idea that's almost impossible to formulate coherently.
*  But whether taken to be empirical claims or terminological stipulations,
*  these doctrines rule out much of what has been discovered about rule following in language or perception,
*  other domains of cognitive science that includes the basic rules of language, which do not have that property,
*  or what Donald Hoffman, cognitive scientist, his study of what he calls visual intelligence,
*  what he calls the rigidity rule, that's the rule that image projections are interpreted as projections of rigid motions in three dimensions,
*  even with highly impoverished stimuli, obviously by mechanisms that are totally inaccessible to consciousness.
*  And that's rule following beyond the most superficial level.
*  There is, all of which is ruled out by contemporary philosophical doctrine, which tells us something about the doctrine, I think.
*  There's reason to believe that what reaches consciousness, even potentially,
*  may well be just a scattered reflection of inaccessible mental processes,
*  which interact intimately with fragments that reach consciousness.
*  There's now famous experiments, which some of you may know about, the Libet experiment on decision making.
*  They provide some independent evidence about this matter,
*  though what they show is that milliseconds before a conscious decision to do something, say pick this up,
*  there's already activity in the relevant parts of the motor cortex.
*  That's been interpreted as having some bearing on freedom of will,
*  but I think that's just an error. It just says that whatever decisions and choices are made are beyond accessibility to consciousness.
*  If this is correct, as it seems to be, then the recent focus on conscious awareness or accessibility to conscious may be an error.
*  It may, in fact, seriously impede the development of a science of mind.
*  These are topics of considerable interest. There's no time to pursue them here.
*  Instead of that, let's return to Mysterianism in the broad sense, not restricted to consciousness,
*  taking it to be Truism, as I think it is.
*  We can consider various kinds of mysteries.
*  Some of them are quite far-reaching, such as those I mentioned, probably permanent mysteries for humans.
*  I'll return to these, but before doing that, it's worth considering mysteries of a kind that are narrower,
*  the cases that might fall within our cognitive capacities and where there might, in principle, be relevant empirical evidence,
*  though it's impossible for us to obtain it. It's an interesting category of mysteries.
*  Or even narrower, cases where ethical considerations bar experiments that might answer questions that we can sensibly pose.
*  So, for example, a lot is known about the neurology of the human visual system, thanks to invasive experiments with cats and monkeys.
*  But we can't learn anything about language that way.
*  There is simply nothing homologous known in the animal world.
*  And relevant human experiments, which you can think of, are barred.
*  Possibly some barriers might erode with new technology, but that's so far just a hope.
*  Well, among these mysteries, at least now, maybe forever, is the question of the origins of the atomic concepts
*  for thought and language, roughly words, but not quite.
*  These are quite different in human thought and language from anything that's found in systems of animal communication.
*  There seems to be a total discontinuity.
*  The latter animal systems appear to be linked directly to entities in the extramental world,
*  can be identified without any consideration of the symbolic system itself.
*  So let's take a vervet monkey that has five signals, five calls.
*  One of them is associated with fluttering of leaves.
*  We interpret that to mean a predator's coming. I don't know what the monkeys do.
*  Another might be associated with a detectable hormonal change, which we interpret as meaning I'm hungry.
*  That appears to be quite general across all known animal systems and totally different from human language,
*  where even the simplest elements, simplest words, lack this property, contrary to a conventional referentialist doctrine,
*  which holds that there is a direct relation between words and extramental entities that's illustrated in the titles of standard works,
*  like the Quine's Word and Object or Roger Brown's Word and Things and in extensive literature.
*  Furthermore, the associations for animal symbol systems are of a kind quite different from anything in human language.
*  One of the leading specialists on the topic, Laura Ann Petito, who directed the famous NIM project,
*  she writes that chimps, unlike humans, use labels in a way that seems to rely heavily on some global notion of association.
*  So a chimp will use the same label, we take it to be apple, to refer to the action of eating apples,
*  the location where apples are kept, events and locations of objects other than apples that happen to be stored with an apple.
*  Let's say the knife that was used to cut it and so on and so forth, all simultaneously and without apparent recognition of the relevant differences
*  or the advantages of being able to distinguish among them.
*  In contrast, even in the first words of a young human baby, she's intensively studied human babies,
*  these are used in a concept-constrained way, but the usage of chimps, even after years of training and of communication with humans,
*  never displays this sensitivity to differences among natural kinds.
*  So surprisingly, she concludes chimps do not really have names for things at all.
*  They only have a hodgepodge of loose associations.
*  Human language is radically different, except in one respect.
*  It also doesn't have names for things, although for different reasons.
*  The atomic concepts of human language and thought, kind of word-like elements, do not pick out entities of the extramental world,
*  entities that say a physicist could discover without investigating the human mind.
*  So there apparently is no notion of reference or denotation for human language,
*  though of course there are actions of referring and denoting something quite different.
*  One can posit a circumstance-dependent relation of something like reference derived from acts of referring.
*  So for example, the name Jones refers to the person Jones, and incidentally the notion person is far from an innocent notion.
*  It can do so insofar as we refer to him by using the name in some particular circumstances.
*  But the act of referring is the only really functioning notion, contrary to widespread belief.
*  This much incidentally was already clear to Aristotle.
*  He concluded that, quoting him, we can define a house as stones, bricks, and timbers in terms of the material constitution,
*  but also as a receptacle to shelter chattels and living beings in terms of function and design.
*  And Aristotle says we must combine both parts of the definition, integrating matter and form,
*  since the essence of a house involves the purpose and end of the material constitution.
*  Hence, a house is not a mind-independent object, and that becomes still clearer when we investigate the meaning of the word further.
*  It's not time to go into it, but you find that very quickly,
*  and we discover that the concept house has much more complex properties universally across languages.
*  That's an observation that generalizes to every word you can think of.
*  Inquiry reveals that even the simplest words have quite intricate meanings.
*  Notice that Aristotle was defining the entity house, not the word house.
*  For him, it's a matter of metaphysics.
*  In fact, I've been quoting from his metaphysics.
*  The entity is a combination of matter and form.
*  In the 17th century, there was a kind of a cognitive revolution,
*  and this general point of view shifted towards seeking what were called innate cognoscative processes,
*  that enter into our understanding of experience and that reshape experience to conform to our modes of cognition.
*  Summarizing these many years of discussions of such topics, quite rich discussion,
*  and for his own independent reasons, Hume concluded that the identity that we ascribe to minds, vegetables,
*  animal bodies, and other entities is only a fictitious one,
*  established by the imagination upon like objects and not a particular nature belonging to this form, something mind independent.
*  Recent studies of acquisition have shown that even the most elementary words, meaning bearing elements,
*  are acquired from very restricted evidence, often very rapidly during the early years of life, even under severe sensory constraints.
*  It's difficult to see how one can avoid the conclusion that these intricate structures depend on innate cognoscative pathways
*  It's difficult to see how one can avoid the conclusion that these intricate structures depend on innate cognoscative powers
*  of the kinds that were in fact explored in quite interesting ways during the first cognitive revolution of the 17th century.
*  And intricacies mount very rapidly when you go beyond the simplest elements like words,
*  reinforcing the conclusion that innate properties of the mind play a critical role in their acquisition and use, of course, well beyond accessibility to consciousness.
*  Well, if these conclusions do indeed generalize, it seems to be the case, it would follow that natural language has no semantics in the technical sense.
*  Technical sense means relations between symbols and things outside the system, reference denotation.
*  Rather, natural language has syntax, some kind of symbol manipulation internal to the mind, and pragmatics, modes of use of language.
*  The field of formal semantics, which includes model theoretic semantics, falls under syntax in this categorization.
*  It's a form of symbol manipulation. It's motivated by external world considerations, not just as phonology, the study of sound systems, is motivated by external events.
*  But it relates to the world only in quite complex ways in the context of theories of action.
*  Well, these conclusions pose very serious problems for any potential theory of the origin of language.
*  As I mentioned, it seems to be the case that animal communication systems are based on a one-to-one relation between mind-brain processes and an aspect of the environment to which these processes adapt the animal's behavior.
*  I'm quoting from a standard review.
*  If so, then the gap between human language and animal communication is as dramatic in this domain as it is in every other domain, the domain of language structure, acquisition, and use.
*  So there is a problem about a radical discontinuity between humans and anything in the animal world.
*  And no time to go into it here, but that discontinuity appears to have emerged very recently, probably within the last 100,000 years, which is nothing in evolutionary time.
*  Well, let's turn briefly to the objects to which a speaker refers.
*  So we have to ask what qualifies.
*  Actually, Quine was much concerned with this topic.
*  He observed that in some cases a noun phrase may not be, I'm quoting, a compelling candidate for thinghood, quoting Daniel Dennett discussing the issues recently.
*  Dennett observes Paris and London plainly exist, but do the miles that separate them also exist?
*  And Quine's answer, Dennett writes, is that a noun phrase of this kind, like miles, is defective and its putative reference need not be taken seriously from an ontological point of view.
*  And there do seem to be distinctions among candidates for things, things, but questions arise very quickly.
*  So it takes, say, the word thing.
*  That should be a compelling candidate for thinghood, you might imagine.
*  But what are the identity conditions for things?
*  How many of them are there?
*  How can we find out?
*  Well, suppose, for example, that we see some branches strewn on the ground.
*  If they fell from a tree after a storm, they're not a thing.
*  But if they were placed there carefully by an artist as a work of conceptual art, maybe given a name, then the construction is a thing, might win an award, an art exhibit.
*  And a little thought will show that complex factors enter into determining whether some part of the world constitutes a thing.
*  That includes human intention and design, a versatility in form, which are not properties that can be detected by study of the mind in the independent world.
*  And if thing doesn't qualify for thinghood, what does?
*  Answer, I suspect, nothing.
*  What about Dennett's examples, Paris and London, which he says are prototypical examples of real things?
*  Well, we can refer to them.
*  So if I were to say I visited London the year before it was destroyed by a great fire and then rebuilt with entirely different materials and design,
*  50 miles up the Thames, where I intend to revisit it next year, London, I'm referring to London.
*  But evidently the extramental world doesn't contain an entity with properties like that, an entity that a physicist could in principle discover.
*  We can, however, refer to London either by using the name London or by a pronoun linked to it or by some more complex phrase, maybe my favorite city or something else.
*  What this means is that in my internal language, whatever is stored up here, there is an internal entity, London, not necessarily matching yours exactly,
*  constituted of elements that provide perspectives for referring to aspects of the world, something that is familiar to phonologists.
*  It's similar to the way that the features of the internal phonetic element, say ta, provide means for me to pronounce and interpret certain events in the world,
*  but it doesn't pick out an entity in the world.
*  And these terms, classical paradoxes, become impossible to formulate.
*  That's from Plutarch's Ship of Theseus to Saul Kierke's current puzzles, all of which are stated in terms of referentialist assumptions and become unstatable if you reject those assumptions.
*  With the rise of corpuscular theories in the 17th century, the focus of investigation into topics like these shifted from individuation,
*  so what makes an individual distinct from others, to the prior question of identity, what makes an individual the same through time despite changes.
*  So for a corpuscularian, like all the great scientists of the 17th century, an individual is just what it is.
*  Robert Boyle said, distinct portion of matter which a number of corpuscles make up.
*  A study of identity through time led pretty soon to a cognitive treatment of the issue.
*  Teale puts it in his standard work, as substantial forms are denied and no principle of identity could be discovered in the things themselves,
*  it is recognized that their identity must depend on what we regard as their essential constituents, that is, on our criteria for judging, on our concepts of things.
*  This subjectivist revolution, as Teale calls it, was carried forward particularly by Locke, for whom existence is preserved under the same denomination,
*  that is, in terms of our internal abstract ideas which we employ to think about the world.
*  David Hume interprets our tendency to assign identity through time as a kind of a natural instinct which constructs like an animal instinct,
*  which constructs experience to conform to the modes of cognition, in Kantian terms, and in ways that sharply differ from anything in the animal world.
*  And this instinct, Hume writes, is developed by the imagination which creates concepts that bind a succession of related objects together,
*  leading us to imagine something unknown and mysterious connecting the parts.
*  So, ascription of identity is a construction of the imagination and the factors that enter into constructing these fictions become a topic of cognitive science.
*  Although at this point, Hume would have demurred if the imagination is, as he thought, quoting him,
*  a kind of magical faculty which is inexplicable by the utmost efforts of human understanding.
*  These early modern forms of Mysterianism are fundamental.
*  They lead to a fundamental kind of the sort that I mentioned briefly earlier.
*  For Locke and for Hume, it follows simply from epistemological considerations that the limits of our understanding are extremely narrow, even in principle.
*  However, Locke and Hume also took quite seriously the new science-based Mysterianism that arose from Newton's demolition of the Mechanical Philosophy,
*  which, as I said, had provided the very criterion of intelligibility for the Scientific Revolution of the 17th century,
*  which was based on the conception of the world as an elaborate machine.
*  It's commonly believed that Newton presented a conception of the world as a machine.
*  That's exactly the opposite. Newton showed that nothing is a machine and whatever the world is, it's not a machine.
*  Galileo had insisted that theories are intelligible only under a very restrictive condition.
*  As he put it, if we can duplicate their posits by means of appropriate artificial devices.
*  That was a concept that was maintained by Descartes, Leibniz, Huygens, Newton, all the great figures of the Scientific Revolution.
*  Accordingly, Newton's discoveries left the world unintelligible when his theological assumptions are dismissed.
*  And the solution that was kind of tacitly reached, as I mentioned earlier, was simply to lower the goals of science,
*  abandoning the search for intelligibility of the world in favor of something much weaker,
*  the search for theories that are intelligible to us, whether or not what they posit is intelligible.
*  So it was quite natural for Bertrand Russell a century ago to dismiss the very idea of an intelligible world as absurd.
*  There is, we'll never get, an understanding of the world. That's no longer a reasonable goal for scientific inquiry.
*  Well, while the list of Mysterians is long and distinguished, as these examples illustrate,
*  their stance seems to contrast with the exuberant contemporary thesis that the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment
*  provided humans with limitless explanatory power, as illustrated by the rapid development of modern science.
*  This was recently articulated by physicist David Deutsch, who wrote that the great achievements of the Enlightenment and modern science,
*  early modern science, was to direct inquiry to the quest of good explanations so that potential progress is unbounded.
*  Philosopher of physics David Albert expounds his thesis with the introduction of that particular habit of concocting
*  and evaluating new hypotheses. There's a sense that we can do anything.
*  The capacities of a community that has mastered this method to survive and to learn and to remake the world,
*  according to its inclinations, are in the long run literally boundless.
*  I can't discern any argument here that addresses the range of the Mysterian concerns and conclusions of the classical literature,
*  which I think are quite sound. However, there are basic assumptions here that trace back to Peirce again.
*  Peirce did offer an argument related to Albert's observation about mastering the method to survive.
*  Peirce, who was writing right after Darwin, proposed that the, what he called the abductive instinct,
*  that allows us to choose among a limited range of admissible hypotheses, he argues that developed through natural selection,
*  variants that yielded truths about the world, yielded a selectional advantage,
*  and were retained through Darwinian descent with modifications with others while others fell away.
*  That belief, however, is totally unsustainable.
*  There's nothing in natural selection that equipped humans to develop quantum theory or anything else for that matter.
*  On the contrary, the theory of evolution leads to the opposite conclusion.
*  It places humans firmly within the natural world, takes them to be biological organisms,
*  which like others necessarily have scope and limits, including the cognitive domain.
*  So those who accept modern biology should be thoroughgoing Mysterians.
*  While dropping the untenable recourse to natural selection,
*  we're left with a serious and challenging scientific inquiry to determine,
*  try to determine the innate components of our cognitive nature in language, perception,
*  concept formation, theory, construction, artistic creation, or other domains of life.
*  And a further task is to try to determine the scope and limits of human understanding
*  while recognizing that some differently structured intelligence might regard human mysteries as simple problems
*  and wonder that we cannot find the answers.
*  Just as we observe the inability of rats to run prime number mazes
*  simply because they lack the concept by the very nature of their cognitive capacities.
*  And far from bewailing the existence of mysteries for humans, we should be extremely grateful for it.
*  If there are no limits to abduction, then our cognitive capacities would also have no scope.
*  Just as if the genetic endowment imposed no constraints on growth and development.
*  In that case, an organism could only become some shapeless amoeboid creature
*  reflecting accidents of an unanalyzed environment.
*  The conditions that prevent a human embryo from becoming an insect
*  also play the decisive role in determining that it can become a human.
*  And the same holds in the cognitive domain. It's a simple logical point.
*  And so the classical aesthetic theory recognized the same relation between scope and limits.
*  Recognized that without rules, there can be no creative activity.
*  Even when the creative activity challenges, tries to revise prevailing rules.
*  Honesty should lead us to concede, I think, that we understand little more about creativity
*  than the Spanish physician-philosopher Juan Huarte did in the 16th century
*  when he distinguished the kind of intelligence humans share with animals
*  from the higher grade that humans alone possess and is illustrated in the normal creative use of language.
*  And proceeding beyond that, from the still higher grade illustrated in true artistic and scientific creativity.
*  Nor do we know whether these are questions that fall within the scope of human understanding
*  or whether they are among what Hume took to be nature's ultimate secrets
*  consigned to that obscurity in which they ever did and ever will remain.
