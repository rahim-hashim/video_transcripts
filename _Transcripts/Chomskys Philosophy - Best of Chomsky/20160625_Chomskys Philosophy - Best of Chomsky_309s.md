# Noam Chomsky - The Emergence of Language
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [June 25, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oJbh5m5SlI)
*  Remember, language hasn't evolved at all for 50,000 years since humans left Africa.
*  A small group left Africa, spread over the world, and we're all basically identical.
*  If you take an infant from an Amazonian tribe that hasn't had other human contact for 20,000 years
*  and bring it up in Baltimore, it'll speak straight Baltimore English, end up here studying physics, and conversely.
*  There are individual differences among humans, but there don't seem to be any significant or almost detectable group differences.
*  So nothing's happened for about 50,000 years.
*  If you go back about 50,000 years before that, there isn't really any evidence that there was language.
*  I mean, in that, of course, we're beyond, as I said, you don't have comparative evidence, you don't have fossil evidence,
*  but you do have artifacts.
*  And in fact, there was a big kind of creative explosion that took place somewhere in that window, say maybe 35,000 years ago.
*  A sudden explosion of symbolic representation, complex social structures, observations, parent observations of astronomical events,
*  all kinds of things just suddenly happened.
*  In general, it's usually assumed, you know, we don't have direct evidence, that this must have been connected with this sudden emergence of language.
*  And notice that it's very sudden in evolutionary times.
*  You can double or triple the numbers.
*  It's still a flick of an eyelash in evolutionary time.
*  So somewhere in a very small window, something happened and then nothing happened afterwards.
*  That part we're pretty sure of.
*  Well, what would have happened?
*  Whatever happened, unless there's some mechanism that biology hasn't discovered yet, whatever happened would be some rewiring of the brain,
*  some mutation that caused a rewiring of the brain.
*  And that rewiring of the brain would have given this mechanism, this computational mechanism that allows these things to happen.
*  So what a rewiring of the brain, a mutation takes place in an individual, not in a group.
*  Okay, that's obvious.
*  So this happened to somebody, you know, some person in some small hunter-gatherer group underwent this change.
*  That person had the capacity to do what we all do internally, but without the externalization because there was nobody to talk to.
*  So there's no reason to think it was externalized at all.
*  Just that whatever's going on in our heads that is pre-linguistic that we get bits and pieces of it when we think about, that would have been available for one person.
*  Well, you know, if there's any selective advantage to that, say, ability to plan and so on, it could have been, it could proliferate in a small group over generations.
*  There could be enough people who had that, so it would make some sense to interact.
*  But then at that point you would get externalization.
*  But externalization is a very tough process.
*  There's this internal thing in the head which developed without any external pressures, okay, because there were no selectional pressures on it, almost by definition.
*  So it's kind of like a snowflake, you know, something that just develops because that's the way nature works.
*  You have this thing in the head, you have a sensory motor system which has been around for hundreds of thousands of years and has nothing to do with it.
*  And you have to match them up.
*  That's a complicated process.
*  In fact, that's where practically, as far as we know, that's where almost all the complexity of language is.
*  And when you learn a language, that's what you learn.
*  A child is acquiring a language, that's what they acquire.
*  Nobody teaches you, you don't learn the kinds of things I mentioned at the beginning, which are probably just part of the way the snowflake works.
*  So it was, and then of course once you have the externalization, you could have some kind of communication.
*  So, you know, even from the minimal evolutionary speculation, and of course it's all speculation, it looks like a plausible scenario.
*  It incidentally has looked that way to some of the leading evolutionary biologists too.
*  It's hard to think of an alternative, in fact.
*  So yeah, it does kind of sound intuitive that people ought to be communicating all the time.
*  What else do they need language for?
*  But like a lot of obvious things, when you look at it, it just doesn't seem to be true.
