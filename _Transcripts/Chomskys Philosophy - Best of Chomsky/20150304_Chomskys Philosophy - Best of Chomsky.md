# Noam Chomsky - Controlling Your Own Work
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [March 04, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSSCWAjsc7M)
*  Okay, I mean the principle as far as I can see goes right back to the Enlightenment, you know
*  Like if you go back to classical enlightenment thought I'm now talking about Adam Smith and you know, Jefferson and those guys
*  the
*  Sort of core idea is people have a right to control their own work, you know
*  Okay that the that if a person here I'll quote some standard formula back in the 18th century, you know leading
*  Heroes of the Enlightenment is if a person works on it if a person does beautiful work
*  Under external command meaning for wages
*  We may admire what he does, but we despise what he is because not a free human being. Okay
*  That goes all the way through
*  classical liberal thought enlightenment thought I mean, you know Alexis de Tocqueville says
*  Under wage labor
*  The art advances the artisan declines
*  Now you find this going right into the working-class movements and Lowell and Lawrence. I think that's just natural
*  I wouldn't try to convince anybody of it. It seems to me if you think about it. Yeah, why should you work on command? I
*  Mean if you work on command, you're some kind of slave
*  You know, why not work because it's coming out of your needs and interests
*  I mean like cheap for me to say I'm gonna fancy University and a science department and I can do that
*  one of the nice things about being in the Sun in
*  Sciences offense fancy universities. You really do have workers control. I'm to a very large extent
*  We control what we do, you know want to work on this topic. I work on that topic
*  I mean you got to sell it to funders and this and that but the degree of workers control at the elite level is quite substantial
*  I mean, that's why it's such a privilege to be in a science department
*  You know enormously privileged existence forget the money if they pay you one-tenth the amount of money
*  It would still be a much better existence than working on command now. I think people do know that
*  You know, I don't think that these
*  Enlightenment ideas are hard to grasp. I think people know that if you work on under external control you may despise
*  admire what the person does but despise what he is because
*  His labor, you know the sort of central part of your life is being done at somebody else's orders and
*  You are not controlling the way it's done or why it's done or how it's used or anything else
*  Well, you can't have every individual controlling every single thing, but that's why you have
*  Democratic structures because people control things together, you know, okay
*  I I don't know how to I wouldn't try to convince anybody of this because I frankly just don't believe that everyone doesn't know it
*  I think maybe I'm sentimental but it seems to me if you sort of
*  cut away waves of you know layers of
*  Distortion and delusion these things that were considered pretty obvious 200 years ago are still obvious
