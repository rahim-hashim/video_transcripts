# Noam Chomsky - The Israel/Palestine Conflict I
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [December 02, 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AJlfW0g2rk)
*  This is the 35th year of a harsh brutal and vicious occupation
*  Supported unilaterally by the United States constant terror and atrocities
*  The supposed Palestinians say well, we're under terrorist attack for 35 years
*  Therefore we have a right to carry out suicide bomb. Do you accept this?
*  Does anybody accept it nobody accepts?
*  All right
*  Then how come everyone accepts the Israeli claim to be doing it which is much weaker claim because after all there's no symmetry
*  In the situation they are the military occupiers
*  Palestine isn't occupying Israel and this isn't just started now. It's gone on years ago
*  I mean, so does that in your mind justify?
*  No, it says much of course not doesn't in anybody's mind validates both sides
*  Those who defend suicide bombing and they're very few
*  Have not not a leg to stand on those who defend the Israeli atrocities
*  including the US government
*  most intellectual opinion
*  Good bit of the West generally. Yeah, they don't have a leg to stand on either and it's and they have a much weaker position
*  35 years
*  There has been a harsh brutal
*  miserable
*  military occupation
*  There has not been a political settlement. The reason why there has not been a political settlement is that the United States
*  Unilaterally has blocked it for 25 years
*  Is it supported by the entire world including the majority of the American people the answer to that question is yes
*  There is a political settlement that has been supported by virtually the entire world
*  Including the Arab states the PLO Europe Eastern Europe, Canada
*  Didn't Barack put that on the table? No, he did not he did not
*  What this that is also supported by the majority of the American people it has just been reiterated by Saudi Arabia
*  the US has
*  Unilaterally blocked it for 25 years what Barack put on the table
*  The population doesn't know this because people like the Western media the media in Canada in the United States don't tell them
*  Like you can check and see how often you you for example or others have reported what I just said
*  I don't don't bother checking the answer is zero
*  the Barack proposal in Camp David in
*  The Barack Clinton proposal
*  In the United States I didn't check the Canadian media in the United States you cannot find a map
*  Which is the most important thing of course?
*  Check in Canada and see if you can find a map you go to Israel you can find a map if you go to scholarly sources
*  You can find a map. Here's what you find when you look at a map you find that this generous magnanimous proposal
*  guaranteed
*  provided
*  Israel with a salient
*  East of Jerusalem
*  Including the city of Maladu meme which was established
*  Primarily by the labor government and Clinton in order to bisect the West Bank that salient goes almost to Jericho
*  Breaks the West Bank into two canton's then there's a second salient to the north
*  Going to the Israeli settlement of Ariel which bisects the northern part into two canton's
*  So we've got three canton's in the West Bank virtually separated all three of them are separated
*  from a small area of East Jerusalem, which is the center of
*  Palestinian commercial
*  And cultural life and of communication say you got four canton's all separated from the West from Gaza
*  So that's five canton's all surrounded by
*  Israeli settlements infrastructure development and so on
*  Which also instantly guarantee Israel control of the water resources the reason last comment
*  This does not rise to the level of South Africa 40 years ago when South Africa established the Bantu stands
*  That's the generous magnanimous offer and there's a good reason why maps weren't shown because as soon as you look at the map you see
*  It all right. However, that's the characterization of it. But let me just say
*  Arafat didn't even bother putting a counter proposal on the table. That's not true. They negotiated at Taba afterwards
*  That's not true. I guess my question is that's not they don't continue to negotiate except that's totally false
*  And that's not not only is it false but not a single participant in the meetings says it that's a media fabrication
*  That Arafat didn't put a kid. They had a proposal. They had a proposal. They proposed the international consensus
*  Which has been accepted by the entire world the Arab states the PLO the majority is American
*  Sorry, they proposed a settlement which is in accord with an overwhelming
*  My question is and it's blocked by the United States
*  Problem that people look at now the Middle East as they say it's spun out of control
*  How do you get back to first way we get back first way we get back is by
*  Trying the experiment of minimal honesty. Okay, let's try that experiment if we try the experiment of minimal honesty
*  We look at our own position and we discover what I just described that for 25 years
*  The United States has blocked the political settlement
*  Which is supported by the majority of the American population and by the entire world except for Israel virtually
*  I mean there's some marginal exceptions
*  So first thing we do is accept the honesty to look at that we take a look at Camp David
*  And we see I was the same the United States was still proposed
*  demanding a
*  banthusthan style settlement and rejecting the
*  Overwhelming international consensus on the position of the American people we then discovered that the United States
*  Immediately moved to enhance terror in the region. So let's continue
*  on September 29th
*  Ehud Barak put a massive military presence outside the Al Aqsa mosque
*  Very provocative when people came out of the mosque
*  Young people started throwing stones these early armies started shooting half of them people were killed and escalated the next couple of days
*  There was no Palestinian fire at this time and it's all in occupied territories in the next couple of days
*  Israel used
*  US helicopters
*  Israel produces no helicopters use US helicopters to attack civilian complexes
*  Killing about a dozen people and wounding several dozen
*  Clinton reacted to that on October 3rd by making the biggest deal in a decade to send Israel new
*  military
*  Helicopters which had just been used for the purpose I described and of course would continue to be the US press
*  Cooperated with that by refusing to publish the story to this day. They have not published the fact
*  It continued when Bush came in one of his first acts was to send Israel a new shipment of the most advanced
*  Military helicopters in the arsenal that continues right up to a couple of weeks ago with new shipments
*  You take a look at the reports from say Janine by British correspondents like Peter Beaumont and the London Observer
*  He says the worst atrocity there was the Apache helicopters buzzing around
*  Destroying and demolishing everything. Yeah, this is enhancing terror and we may easily continue
*  We can take also let me continue on December 15th
*  14th the Security Council tried to pass a resolution
*  Calling for what everyone recognized to be the obvious means for reducing terror namely sending international monitors
*  That's a way of reducing terror. This happened to be in the middle of a quiet period which lasted for about three weeks
*  the US vetoed it
*  Ten days before that there was a meeting at Geneva of the high contracting parties of the fourth Geneva Convention
*  Which has unanimously held for 35 years that it applies to Israel
*  it the meeting
*  Condemned the Israeli settlements as illegal
*  Condemned a list of atrocities
*  willful destruction of property murder
*  Trials torture and so on and so forth. So what happened to that meeting?
*  I'll tell you what happened to that meeting the US boycotted it
*  Therefore the media refused to publish it. Therefore. No one here knows that the United States once again
*  enhanced terror by
*  Refusing to recognize the applicability of conventions which make virtually everything the United States and the
*  Israel are doing there a a grave breach of the Geneva Conventions of change the war crime just a minute these
*  Conventions were established
*  In 1949 in order to criminalize the atrocities of the Nazis in occupied territory
*  They are customary international law the United States is
*  Obligated as a high contracting party to prosecute violations of those conventions
*  That means to prosecute its own leadership for the last 25 years
