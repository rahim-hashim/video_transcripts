# Noam Chomsky - Conspiracy Theories
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [May 08, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JirrKIQfOmk)
*  Conspiracy theories, which have become quite popular amongst those people who identify as progressive.
*  I know you've been fairly critical of those ideas. Why do you think that they're popular now?
*  First of all, there are conspiracies. No question about it. In fact, sometimes they have a big effect.
*  Like the suburbanization of America. The huge government, state, corporate social engineering projects,
*  which were largely dedicated to maximizing the inefficient use of fossil fuels with everything that goes along with it.
*  Well, you know, it may destroy the species, so it's not insignificant.
*  But it did start as a literal conspiracy of General Motors, Standard Oil of California, and Firestone Rubber
*  to buy up and destroy the fairly efficient electric transport system in Los Angeles and other cities,
*  destroy it and turn it into the monstrosity that we have.
*  Okay, that was a conspiracy. In fact, they were taken to court and fined a couple thousand dollars.
*  But looking for something hidden that's sort of beneath the surface that's really running things,
*  I think that's a...sometimes it's true, but usually it turns out to be a pathology.
*  I think it comes from a sense that I don't like the way things are,
*  and so there must be some hidden hand somewhere that's manipulating and controlling it.
*  Whereas when you look closely, I think you just see the normal workings of institutional structures.
*  That makes you, of course, raise questions about the nature of the society, who we are, how we tolerate it, and so on.
*  So for example, it's appealing to believe that, say, John F. Kennedy, one of the main figures in conspiracy theory,
*  what are called conspiracy theories, it would be nice to believe he's just a fantastically wonderful guy,
*  who's going to do all kinds of great things, and they shot him down just because he was so wonderful,
*  and the world has gone off, you know, out on a hand desk ever since then.
*  That's a comforting feeling. It's less comforting to recognize what I think the documentary record demonstrates in the historical record.
*  He was kind of a hawk who was a politician trying to gain power by the usual techniques.
*  He was kind of affable and friendly and smiled, and he'd better butter people up.
*  But if you take a look at what he was doing, he was pretty horrible. He was one of the most dangerous creatures of the 20th century.
*  And fortunately, he didn't happen to blow up the world, but he came pretty close to it.
*  That's a less comforting position. I happen to think it's largely true, same with Barack Obama.
*  But you can see the appeal of trying to find, well, take, say, Obama.
*  There's a widespread feeling on the left, you know, Middle Eastern commentators and so on,
*  that he's really dedicated, doing wonderful things. It's just that dark forces are preventing it.
*  So we just have to hope that he's going to overcome the dark forces, you know,
*  like a hero in a fairy tale, and somehow get rid of the witches and dragons, and everything will be nice.
*  I don't think there's any truth to that. That's exactly what he seems to be.
*  And nobody's going to ride in on a white horseback and get rid of the dragons and the witches.
*  We've got to do it ourselves. That's harder.
*  Right. So would you say that conspiracy theories in general are not particularly helpful for radical politics and radical action?
*  If they're inaccurate. I mean, if they're accurate, as they sometimes are, sure, that helps explain the world.
*  But most of what happens is kind of a... I mean, in a sense, it's a conspiracy.
*  If the board of directors of General Motors get together and decide, okay, here's our plans for next year,
*  it's kind of a conspiracy. But we don't call that a conspiracy theory, because it's the normal working of institutions.
*  And similarly, when the, you know, take, say, during the Second World War, the high State Department planners
*  and comparable figures from the private sector, like the Council on Foreign Relations,
*  did meet and extensively discuss the nature of the post-war world and lay plans which were pretty well executed.
*  Well, this happened to be public, but is it a conspiracy?
*  You know, they got together, they worked out plans, they later implemented them, swole a group of people,
*  they have special interests, not the interests of the population. But exposing that makes perfect sense.
*  That's not what's called a conspiracy theory, because that's the way institutions operate.
*  And that makes sense, you know. On the other hand, you know, this... take... I don't like to use the term,
*  because there are conspiracies. It's called a conspiracy theory. If we don't like it or something,
*  it's not the way to look at it. What you have to ask is whether the theories of the conspiracy are accurate.
*  So let's take, say, the idea that the Bush administration plotted to blow up the World Trade Center.
*  That attracts huge support. Maybe a third of the population believes it, and very dedicated groups of people,
*  many of them on the left, they're just committed to that. Is it plausible?
*  I mean, suppose that the... let's say somebody conspired to blow up the World Trade Center.
*  We know what they did. They blamed it on Saudis. Would the Bush administration blame it on Saudis,
*  thereby shooting themselves in the feet? I mean, if they wanted to bomb Iraq.
*  So if they'd organized it, they would have blamed it on Iraqis. Then they'd have no problem at all
*  getting congressional authorization, the UN resolution, you know, NATO would join in, everybody would say,
*  fine, let's invade Iraq. Instead, whoever did it blamed it on Saudis.
*  Well, that absolves the Bush administration short of outright insanity.
*  So why harm your relations with a valued ally instead of blaming it on the people you want to invade?
*  So it's already a barrier to even entertaining the possibility.
*  And the elaborate work that goes into, you know, is there nanothermite in building 7 or whatever it is,
*  that's kind of a side point. Yeah, maybe there was, maybe there wasn't.
*  Unless you have pretty sophisticated knowledge of civil engineering and structural architecture,
*  you can't even make a judgment as to whether it means anything.
*  But there are obvious, clear phenomena that the theory has to deal with somehow, and it doesn't.
*  And if it doesn't, I don't see any reason to take it seriously.
*  So yes, then it becomes one of these kinds of conspiracy theory that just mislead and misdirect energy and so on.
*  In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if, say, 40 years from now we get declassified documents
*  that would show that the Bush administration was very sympathetic to these theories.
*  It was diverting energy from real crimes into things that are basically a wild goose chase.
*  Actually, we have documents like that about the Kennedy assassination.
*  So there are Pentagon advisory documents which advise the Pentagon, the government,
*  to periodically leak information about the Kennedy assassination, basically so as to keep people out of our hair.
*  You know, let them follow those nonexistent leads instead of asking us questions that we really don't want to answer.
*  So real conspiracy theory there.
*  And there we have the actual documents.
*  And it wouldn't shock me if there are similar things about 9-11 conspiracies.
*  I mean, they do have an immediate effect.
*  They draw a lot of energy and effort away from major crimes,
*  the crimes which are a lot worse than blowing up the World Trade Center.
*  So that's convenient for the powerful.
*  And since the theories seem to have just major logical problems that I don't see how they can confront,
*  like what I mentioned, it does seem to me the kind of theory that misleads and misdirects.
*  And it's not hard to see why it's popular.
*  I mean, some terrible things are going on.
*  There should be some dark hand behind it.
*  We hate Bush and Rumsfeld for good reasons, so maybe they're behind it.
