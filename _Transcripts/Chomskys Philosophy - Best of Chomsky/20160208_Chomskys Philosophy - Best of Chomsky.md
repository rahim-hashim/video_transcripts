# Noam Chomsky - Religion and Politics
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [February 08, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su7tAFQswg0)
*  I find it interesting that in today's political climate, it almost seems that you have to
*  be close to a religious extremist to be taken seriously. I mean, if you listen to even John
*  Kerry in the 2004 election, he was trying to profess his Catholic beliefs as a kind
*  of litmus test for his legitimacy. Does that trend in American politics concern you?
*  Very much so. It's extremely dangerous. I think it's extremely cynical. I mean, the
*  US has been a deeply fundamentalist society since its origins. I mean, the early colonists
*  were religious extremists and the various waves of colonization-
*  The Puritans in New England.
*  Yeah, that spread across the country. Also, we're waving the holy book while they exterminated
*  the heathens and that sort of thing. And there have been repeated periods of religious revivalism.
*  It's kind of like mass hysteria of religious revivalism. The most recent and quite significant
*  one was in the 1950s. It's not that far back and there are others. Since around 1980, I
*  guess, something new has happened. The religious fundamentalism has been- political managers,
*  party managers and so on, recognized something that they kind of ignored before. That you
*  can manipulate religious beliefs, extremist religious beliefs, into creation of a voting
*  block. And since about 1980, what you describe has been the case. Just about every candidate
*  for high office, a president, portrays themselves, whether accurately or not, as a person of
*  deep religious faith. I suspect some of them are about as religious as you and I are.
*  Right.
*  Say, Clinton.
*  Yeah, and for instance, Karl Rove has repeatedly said that he's not- in fact, he was mentioned
*  in a recent article that he's not one of them, in other words, that they're cynically manipulating
*  this base for their own personal power. So it's not that they're sincerely motivated
*  by religious concerns, but they see this base as a way of ensuring their own self-interest.
*  Is that a fair assessment?
*  I didn't see that comment, but that's the way- that's what I conclude from just observing
*  what's been happening. I suspect- I've never really seen a study of this, but I suspect
*  that it began with Carter, who was undoubtedly quite sincere. But he's the first president
*  who sort of went out of his way to present himself, portray himself as a deeply believing
*  Christian. And I think party managers got the point. Yeah, you can use that way of appealing
*  to a substantial electoral base. And since starting with the 1980 election, I think it's
*  just been just about every candidate. In 1980, I recall, there were three candidates, Carter,
*  Reagan, Anderson, all presented themselves as- or their managers, their handlers presented
*  them as deeply religious, whether they were or not, who knows? Carter probably, I'm sure,
*  was, I don't know about the others. And since then, that's been the case. And it's extremely
*  cynical. And for example, nobody cared very much whether, say, Lyndon Johnson or Richard
*  Nixon went to church. Maybe they did, maybe they didn't, but it wasn't an issue.
*  It wasn't relevant.
*  It didn't pay a lot of attention to it. Since, in these last roughly 25 years, it's right
*  in the front. And of course, it's not called religion anymore. It's called faith. Everything
*  has to be faith-based, meaning some form of commitment, dedication to one of the organized
*  religions, leading ultimately to the kind of comment from Romney that I mentioned, which
*  was lauded, whereas it should have been bitterly denounced. And yes, that's had a very negative
*  impact in a lot of respects, as is intended. I mean, it's a way to, from the point of view
*  of party managers, it's a way to marginalize, control, and atomize a population that they're
*  afraid of. I mean, they can read the same opinion polls you and I can. And they know
*  perfectly well that the positions of the two political parties are, sometimes they're called
*  two factions of the same party, on many crucial issues, way to the right of the population.
*  So therefore, elections have to keep away from issues, as they do.
*  I want to follow up on the point you made about faith, because it almost seems that
*  there's a connection between the Republican Party, maybe in some ways the Democratic Party,
*  and a faith-based worldview. Because if faith is believing something for which there is
*  no evidence, and the Republicans paint themselves as the sort of divine managers, for lack of
*  a better phrase, it would seem that what the Republican electorate wants is a kind of submissive,
*  faith-based populace to secede their own political power and representation to them, to sort
*  of act on their interests, but yet at the same time, as you said, they're being cynically
*  manipulated. Do you agree with that?
*  If you look at the opinions of the Republican base, they are not being represented by the
*  Republican Party. That's true on issue after issue. I can't go through the details now,
*  but there's a lot of detailed study of that, on some, and there's others. The population,
*  including the Republican Party, the Republican base, is strongly opposed to policy on many
*  crucial issues, domestic and international. To give one example out of a thousand, in
*  the last electoral campaign, 2004, it turns out that Bush voters were barely aware of
*  his policies. Some small percentage of them, maybe two digits, were familiar with his policies.
*  In one case, and there are many, a majority of people who voted for Bush thought that
*  he supported the Kyoto Protocol.
*  When he did not.
*  Of course, it was strongly, you know, I don't know what he thinks, but his party was strongly
*  against it. But people believed it, and they believed it because they're in favor of it,
*  very strongly in favor of it. And he's kind of a nice guy, and that's the way he's presented
*  in the imagery and delusion that passes for elections here. So he must believe it. And
*  it's the same on a whole bunch of issues.
