# Noam Chomsky - Efficiency
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [November 10, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywt8XGElmwU)
*  I mean, is there evidence, real evidence, that transferring management from public control
*  to private control increases efficiency?
*  That's a little tricky, because when you begin to look, you find a lot of other things.
*  For example, what you find is that in places where the society sort of functions kind of
*  more or less honestly and well, you know, say Sweden or Chile for that matter, public
*  institutions are pretty efficient.
*  So there is no pressure in Chile to privatize the biggest exporter, because it's very efficient.
*  Where there's pressure to privatize, it's usually coming from private power, okay, and
*  not on grounds of efficiency.
*  And in fact, if you look at the effects, it's very unclear what they are.
*  So let's say the Brazilian steel industry, I mean, it was nationalized, always ran at
*  a loss.
*  Okay, so it looks inefficient by some measure.
*  On the other hand, part of the reason it was running at a loss was because it was purposely
*  by state policy producing steel cheaply for the benefit of private manufacturers.
*  So it was a public subsidy to private manufacturers, which made the steel industry look inefficient,
*  right?
*  But for the economy, it might not at all have been inefficient.
*  And when you proceed, that's what you find.
*  So like in England, which is a modern country, they privatized the water system recently.
*  And by economists' measures, it's probably more efficient.
*  On the other hand, people aren't getting water.
*  Poor people don't get water, you know?
*  Yeah, in fact, that's efficient.
*  Like if you had only one, if you were put in charge of the water distribution system
*  and you're an automaton, all human feelings are gone, your only interest is maximizing
*  profit.
*  Well, you know perfectly well what you'd do.
*  You'd cut out water altogether for people who can't pay for it or are sort of not densely
*  — not in some dense area which has a lot of money.
*  Why should they have water at all?
*  I mean, after all, they can go walk somewhere with a bucket on their back and get water.
*  That's probably better by the macroeconomic statistics.
*  So it's more efficient.
*  And in fact, case after case, when you look at privatization, you find an extremely mixed
*  picture.
*  What you usually find is transfer of costs to the public.
*  So take, say, privatization of roads.
*  Well, you know, privatization of roads would mean you'd pay tolls if you're rich enough
*  and you'd go on nice highways.
*  And if you're not rich enough to pay the tolls, well, you know, find your way down a dirt
*  rut somewhere, you know?
*  The total — you know, the economy might look much better.
*  Of course, national product would go up, macroeconomic statistics would look good.
*  But if it was the people, it'd be terrible.
*  It's forced on them.
*  Forced on them from the outside.
*  And it might be a good thing or it might be a bad thing, but you have to look at the cases.
*  So for example, just recently, Brazil privatized the Vale, you know, big, huge industrial mining
*  conglomerate.
*  They sold it off to private power.
*  Well, you know, that's the — a large part of the future of Brazil is there.
*  Brazil has plenty of resources.
*  There was an analysis of Vale done by — there were two analyses of the, you know, the value
*  of it.
*  One was done by Meryl Lynch.
*  That's the one the government was using.
*  Meryl Lynch also happens to be, you know, the agent for a lot of the private purchasers
*  and purchases and so on.
*  Another was done by the engineering department at the Federal University in Rio.
*  Good, serious people.
*  I know some of them.
*  I was down there about a year ago talking.
*  Very serious industrial engineers and those people.
*  They gave an evaluation of Vale, which was far higher, taking into account future needs.
*  You know, what would iron and gold and so on be worth 20 years from now to the people
*  of Brazil and so on.
*  Those considerations weren't taken into account by Meryl Lynch, of course.
*  But they're real.
*  Well, you know, it was sold off.
*  And now private power will make the profit.
*  I can just tell you this much.
*  If you look at the — take a look at today's rich countries and today's poor countries,
*  first world and third world, go back a couple hundred years, you find they weren't very
*  different.
*  In fact, India was the commercial and manufacturing center of the world in the 18th century.
*  As late as the late 19th century, the British were deeply concerned by the fact that British
*  textiles couldn't compete with Chinese textiles because they were much better and better done
*  and so on.
*  They changed.
*  You know, Egypt started to undergo an industrial revolution about the same time the United
*  States did, with comparable prospects.
*  You know, they had their own cotton, big agricultural area and so on.
*  Well, you take a look at what happened since the 18th century.
*  Two regions have developed outside of Europe, the United States and Japan.
*  They are exactly the two regions which were able to fend off European control.
*  The U.S. separated itself.
*  Japan was able to fend off European control.
*  Japan's had the highest growth rate in the world since the Meiji Restoration around 1860.
*  The United States grew very fast.
*  How did they do it?
*  by radically interfering with market principles.
*  So from the very beginning, the United States was super protectionist, had massive, you
*  know, large-scale state subsidies and so on and so forth.
*  Britain had done exactly the same.
*  That's how it became the richest country in the world.
*  Every other industrial developing country has done more or less the same thing.
*  I mean, they used somewhat different magic methods.
*  Like Japan happened to be much more liberal in trading than the United States was.
*  But on the other hand, it had more authoritarian internal systems.
*  So they vary in one way or another.
*  But invariably, I think there is no exception to this, they did it by sharp interference
*  with market principles.
*  What about the Third World?
*  What's called neoliberalism is not liberalism and it's not new.
*  They had it rammed down their throats for hundreds of years and that turned them into
*  the Third World.
*  Well, one aspect of that is the kind of privatization which leaves power in the hands of
*  usually foreign industry or their local counterparts.
*  We've just seen it go on in Mexico.
*  Mexico's had the biggest privatization in modern history in the last, you know, actually
*  the biggest privatization in history probably is the Internet and the whole telecommunication
*  system.
*  Here is a system developed at public expense, which is being given, you know, it's not even
*  sold.
*  Privatization is not as they sell it for something.
*  Here we just give it away, you know, to private powers.
*  That's huge privatization.
*  But in Third World countries, I suppose the main case is Mexico.
*  And in fact, yeah, it's true, the Mexican telephone company and so on, they're getting
*  privatized and you're getting a small couple of hundred billionaires.
*  Service isn't improving except for the rich getting a small number of billionaires.
*  Wages and incomes have collapsed by, you know, a measure of maybe 50 percent during the
*  liberalization period.
*  In 1995, right after the collapse, GNP went down by about 89 percent.
*  Still not recovering.
*  Yeah, that's privatization.
