# Noam Chomsky - Hatred Against Muslims and Arabs
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [December 28, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9UjXa9f8rY)
*  Let me personalize it against Jews. I mean when I grew up as a kid, we were Jewish, anti-Semitism was a very, very visible phenomena.
*  I mean I grew up in a part of a lower middle class section of a city where we happened to be the only Jewish family in an Irish and German Catholic neighborhood,
*  which were mostly Nazis, pro-Nazi pretty openly. And you know I grew up with a visceral fear of Catholics.
*  It wasn't until I was an adult that I could deal with Catholics and somehow not be afraid. It wasn't much fun.
*  When they came out of that Jesuit school, they were frightening creatures.
*  Furthermore when my father found I got enough money to get a second hand car and we could drive around a little,
*  if we'd get to the nearby mountains we'd have to look for a motel because a lot of motels had on them restricted.
*  That means no Jews. When I got to Harvard in 1950, the anti-Semitism was so thick you could cut it with a knife.
*  In fact one of the reasons MIT here is a great university is because a lot of first great people like Paul Samuelson and Robert Wiener didn't get jobs at Harvard
*  because they were Jewish. In fact Harvard got their first Jewish mathematician, that's a Jewish field, while I was there in 1953
*  because the department was so anti-Semitic. I mean this all changed in the 50s, but up until that time anti-Semitism was perfectly overt and very real.
*  And the Jewish community was subdued. You didn't want to be too visible because you had enough problems.
*  It's one of the reasons why refugees from the Holocaust didn't come here.
*  Almost anybody in Europe, certainly people in the DP camps, would have been delighted to come to the United States.
*  They didn't. Refugees from the people who were dying in the DP camps after the Germans were defeated, they were still there and it wasn't very nice.
*  In fact it hadn't changed much except the crematorium weren't going. Very few of them came to the United States, partly because of anti-Semitism,
*  partly because the Jewish community didn't want them, didn't push to bring them here.
*  And for reasons that are not pretty but are understandable. We've got enough problems.
*  Anti-Semitism is no longer a legitimate form of racism. Anti-Arab bias is a legitimate form of racism, meaning you don't have to hide it.
*  In most forms of racism you have to pretend you're not a racist. Say pretend I'm not anti-Semitic, I'm not anti-black.
*  You may be, but you don't advertise it. Anti-Arab racism you're allowed to advertise. This is way before September 11th.
*  And the community, you see it in films and books and attitudes, it's just not even hidden.
*  I mean nobody will come out and say I'm an anti-Arab racist, but it's everywhere and every Muslim or Arab in the country knows it.
*  Now after September 11th, I should add that this shows up in behavior too.
*  So just to give you an illustration, Boston happens to have a big Lebanese community.
*  And while they're not super wealthy, they have money. They're storekeepers, businessmen and so on.
*  In 1982, at the time of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, which was a total horrible atrocity,
*  a few of us made an effort to organize just a charitable relief program for people in Lebanon.
*  We could not get any support from the Lebanese community here.
*  And I think I understand why, because I remember it from childhood.
*  I think they just don't want to be too visible. And I think that's understandable.
*  I can't prove that, but that's the sense that I had.
*  And it's not just since September 11th, yes it's increased, but not only Arabs, but anybody who looks a little bit dark.
