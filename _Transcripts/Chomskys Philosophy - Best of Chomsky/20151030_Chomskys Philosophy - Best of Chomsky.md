# Noam Chomsky - Predatory Capitalism
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [October 30, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agP-pan8bfs)
*  But isn't that what the whole new libertarian movement would tell you is that precisely
*  the government is being used as an extension of the market to protect this kind of like
*  irregular form of capitalism that's hand in glove with the government.
*  We just need to kind of free up government regulation and let capitalism work on its
*  own.
*  First of all, the business world would never tolerate that.
*  They rely heavily on government.
*  But if you did follow the libertarian prescript, what are called, remember what's called libertarian
*  in the United States has nothing to do with traditional libertarianism.
*  It's a kind of ultra right capitalist, anarcho-capitalism they call it.
*  If that was allowed to function, the whole society would collapse.
*  And we turn to total tyranny.
*  We would have tyranny of unaccountable private institutions.
*  A private concentration of capital is totally unaccountable to the public.
*  Absolute tyranny.
*  The only thing that protects the public from predatory capitalism is some degree of state
*  intervention.
*  So it's true that the state intervention does support the capitalist institutions.
*  It also protects the society from total destruction.
*  Predatory capitalist system just simply couldn't survive.
*  I mean, for example, I mean, for perfectly obvious reasons.
*  For one thing, it wouldn't care about externalities, effects on others.
*  So within no time, it would destroy the environment simply by destroying resources, pouring carbon
*  dioxide into the atmosphere.
*  Who cares?
*  Furthermore, there would be no public goods.
*  The markets, I mean, there's an ideology which claims that markets provide freedom
*  of choice.
*  So they're kind of democratic.
*  That's not true.
*  And we all know it's not true.
*  So for example, suppose I want to get home this evening.
*  The market does offer choices.
*  A Ford or a Toyota doesn't offer the choice I want, which is a public transportation system.
*  It's not part of the market.
*  The market focuses you on individual consumption of consumer goods, period.
*  Is that what you want in life?
*  Just more and more gadgets around.
*  There are lots of other things in life which the market doesn't even offer.
*  So what's called libertarianism is a prescription for complete disaster.
*  I don't think the people advocating it understand this.
*  I'm not criticizing them, but just think it through.
*  And I should say it's very anti-libertarian.
*  I mean, traditional libertarianism, which was always on the left, was opposed to the
*  master-servant relation, people giving orders and other people taking them.
*  That's libertarianism, and not in this version.
