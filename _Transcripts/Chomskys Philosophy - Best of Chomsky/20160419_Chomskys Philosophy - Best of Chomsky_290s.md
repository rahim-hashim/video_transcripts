# Noam Chomsky - Properties, Innate Ideas, and Post-structuralism
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [April 19, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDNufwtiqdw)
*  You've assimilated a theory that the stimulus is impoverished and we have constructed internally
*  to Descartes and referred in passing to behaviorism and implied that it sort of had the opposite
*  sort of take on the issue that, you know, why is it taking so much stimulus to sort
*  of get for a child to learn the concepts, linguistic concepts.
*  I was wondering if you would comment on, say, other theories that involve rich stimuli.
*  I'm thinking of Gibson's ecological realism and why is it not as naturalistic approach,
*  why is it not naturalistic to look for properties in the environment, say properties in the
*  environment that would correspond to a container object instead of saying that that structure
*  is in a language faculty?
*  The problem with that is that you can perfectly well say that houses, those things in the
*  environment have all the properties that I mentioned.
*  That's true.
*  Houses are the physical thing out there.
*  It has the property of eliciting a point of view which says you're just an exterior surface
*  and it has the property of eliciting the point of view that says you're an exterior surface
*  plus a distinguished interior with abstract properties.
*  It has all of those properties, must have them.
*  In fact, it has exactly the properties that enabled me to think about it in that way.
*  But the trouble is it also has every other array of properties.
*  Has any array of properties you like.
*  If I design a different organism that decides to look at a house with a distinguished interior
*  surface and some other property, the exterior plus things 10 feet away, has that property
*  too.
*  So you're back to the question, why do I pick out that set of properties?
*  The only answer to that, short of divine intervention, has got to be that it's coming from inside
*  me.
*  So we're back to the same theory.
*  There's only the appearance of a different approach there.
*  That's self-delusion.
*  There seems to be an assumption underlying your theory of natural language that there
*  is a close link between the signifier and the signified.
*  I guess to use your analogy to Kar, that when you and I both look at this figure, we both
*  see a perfect triangle.
*  You're not seeing a triangle and I'm seeing a square.
*  One thing that I'm interested in, if you do agree that this is an assumption that underlies
*  this, why do you make that assumption?
*  Because it's true.
*  And also...
*  I mean, it's overwhelmingly supported.
*  It's not always true in every possible case, but in the case of, in Descartes' case, looking
*  at a triangle, it's true.
*  And you can demonstrate it in the laboratory.
*  How do you respond then to, say, post-structural theorists who come from a radically different
*  assumption?
*  Well, if I understood what they were talking about, I guess I could respond.
*  But not understanding what they're talking about, most of the time I can't respond.
*  If somebody can make a coherent, can present to me...
*  I won't say that I don't understand anything.
*  I mean, there are some things that I read and they kind of evoke images and associations
*  in my mind that I can sort of make up a story and say, well, it probably means that.
*  It usually turns out to be something pretty obvious, such as the fact that your interpretation
*  of a text depends on all sorts of things that you're bringing to it or that the environment,
*  that the history is bringing to it and so on and so forth.
*  Sure, that's obvious.
*  When I try to understand something, to try to find something non-obvious, I can't find
*  it.
*  Maybe that's my defect, like maybe I'm lacking a gene or something.
*  But anyway, when I read it, that's what happens.
*  I should also say that there are a lot of things in the world I don't understand.
*  So for example, if I pick up the latest issue of the physical review and I read one of the
*  articles in it or some set theory journal, I'm not going to understand it either.
*  But there's a radical difference between these cases.
*  In the case of the physical review, first of all, I know that if I made the effort,
*  I could get to understand it.
*  And I know what course to undertake to get closer and closer to understanding it.
*  I've done it in cases which I happen to be interested in.
*  Furthermore, I know that I can go to my friend in the physics department and say, look, this
*  looks like total gibberish to me.
*  Explain it to me at my level of ignorance and stupidity so that I'll be able to understand
*  it.
*  And he can do that.
*  On the other hand, when I try this with a page of Derrida, nobody can explain to me
*  what it means.
*  And I don't know what process to go through to get it to be other than just words spinning
*  around on the page.
*  So maybe it's some new variety of human intellectual achievement that goes beyond quantum physics
*  and set theory and all these other things.
*  But anyhow, it does look qualitatively different to me.
*  As I say, maybe that's my defect.
*  But that's why I can't answer the questions.
