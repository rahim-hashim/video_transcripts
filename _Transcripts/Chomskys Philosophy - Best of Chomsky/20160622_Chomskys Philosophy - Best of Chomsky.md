# Noam Chomsky on Karl Marx
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [June 22, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFqyJYrRHrA)
*  Marx himself was a complex figure, the early Marx. So you read the philosophical
*  manuscripts and so on. This is coming straight out of the French and
*  German Romanticism. So the kinds of ideas you find expressed in Humboldt and in
*  the more libertarian side of Rousseau, Rousseau himself was very split. But if you
*  take the libertarian as part of Rousseau, the second discourse on inequality and
*  Humboldt and so on, all of this was, that's the background in which Marx grew
*  up. And if you read the philosophical and manuscripts of the early period,
*  they're immersed in this. So his theory of alienation comes out of this. Work,
*  coerced labor, is alienating and counter to human nature precisely for these
*  reasons, for the Humboldtian reasons. When you get to the later Marx, you know,
*  it's not, it's sort of like a scholarly debate about whether he changed his mind
*  or just started talking about other things. But anyway, you don't find it any
*  longer. And by that time, Marxism does become exactly as you say, very
*  detrimental to this. So you get this idea which you do find in Marx, but he
*  couldn't have believed it, that human nature is just a historical product and
*  people are just malleable. They're made what their culture turns them into. You
*  get this even in people like Gramsci, who was one of the more libertarian Marxists.
*  But this idea that humans are simply formed by the environment and they are
*  nothing but clay, you know, passive clay in the hands of their molders. That's an
*  idea which is very attractive to radical intellectuals because they think they're
*  going to be the molders, of course, and that leads right to the Leninist version
*  of Marxism. And it does become a kind of orthodoxy. And the earlier views are
*  either forgotten or marginalized, although they're certainly there in Marx
*  and they certainly are in the tradition that he came from.
*  There's a lot to be learned from Marx. What, well, for example, what he wrote
*  about the Russian peasant society, which is not known, and that was pretty
*  interesting. But his analysis of the basic character of kind of an abstract
*  form of capitalism, which is his main work, that's pretty enlightening, I think.
*  It doesn't describe actual societies. It's quite abstract, as he insisted.
*  But there are ideas there that can be applied, could be applied then, still can
*  be applied very effectively to the nature of capitalist society. For example,
*  the things like the environmental crisis, which Marx and Engels wrote about in
*  their terms. There's plenty there to learn from. He was also a great reporter.
*  His commentary on ongoing events in Europe and India and elsewhere is
*  extremely revealing. He's a very penetrating analyst of social systems.
