# Noam Chomsky - A Transfer of Power
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [June 25, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfzFJpDffLE)
*  To the extent that there is an extension of market principles, there's a decline in democracy.
*  Those two things go hand in hand.
*  When you minimize the state, you don't eliminate decision making, you just transfer it.
*  So it's not being made in the state system, it's being made somewhere else.
*  And where the story is, this is a transfer of power to the people, but that's not even a joke,
*  so we don't have to waste any time on that.
*  It's a transfer of power to the private sector, undoubtedly, but that's not the people.
*  That's the highly concentrated power system within the private sector.
*  So in fact, it's a transfer of power from the state system, where there's whatever degree of participation there may be.
*  A lot in some countries, less in other countries, but some degree of participation,
*  and in principle, a lot of participation, in fact, full participation in principle,
*  there's a transfer from that system to a system of unaccountable private power,
*  where in principle there is no participation.
*  So you and I, in principle, have nothing to say about the decisions of General Electric and Microsoft.
*  That's a matter of law and principle.
*  Unless you happen to own some stock, then you have as much say as the stock you own,
*  which means if you're in the top few percentage of the population, you own most of the stock and you have most of the say.
*  But there isn't even in principle, and these are unaccountable also, you also can't find out what they're doing.
*  Like you can't find, you can't read the, find out the books of General Electric. That's a secret.
*  So these are unaccountable private power.
*  Internally, they're essentially totalitarian.
*  If you take a look at the structure of a corporation, it's about as close to the totalitarian model as anything human beings have devised,
*  you know, with power vested at the top, orders going down stage by stage.
*  If you're a middle level manager, say, you take your orders from above and you hand them down below,
*  as in totalitarian systems, say, Stalinist Russia, there's some interaction, you know, like nothing's totally rigid.
*  And other influences. But it's, as I say, about as close to the totalitarian ideal as humans have constructed and unaccountable.
*  And that's where powers, that's where decisions are transferred.
*  So to the extent that these processes are taking place, yeah, it's an attack on democracy virtually by definition.
