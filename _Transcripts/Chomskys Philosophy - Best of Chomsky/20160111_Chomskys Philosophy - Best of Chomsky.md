# Noam Chomsky - Surveillance, Security and Power I
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [January 11, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dafC1Cv-qo)
*  I think there are two things to bear in mind about that. The first thing is that the phenomenon
*  itself shouldn't be at all surprising. The second is that the scale, at least to me,
*  is kind of surprising. I hadn't really expected that scale. But the phenomenon is normal.
*  And it's again as American as apple pie. You can go back a century, take say the Philippine War
*  early in the 19th century, 20th century. It was a vicious war. The U.S. conquered the Philippines,
*  killed a couple hundred thousand people. It was a major popular nationalist movement.
*  After the military victory, it had to be suppressed and controlled. And a huge pacification
*  campaign was initiated using the highest technology of the day for surveillance,
*  subversion, breaking up groups, building up hostilities, all kinds of things.
*  Very sophisticated. It was very quickly transferred home. It was used by Woodrow Wilson in the
*  Red Scare, the worst repression in American history, and developed further since. It's had
*  a lethal effect on the Philippines. People mourn the typhoon that killed tens of thousands of
*  people. That doesn't happen in functioning societies. It's very striking in the Caribbean.
*  When a tropical storm goes through the Caribbean, in Haiti, one of the major victims of imperial
*  violence, it's vicious. Right next door in Cuba, three people die. Some buildings are knocked over.
*  Same storm. Depends on the society. Well, the Philippines is a society that we created,
*  have maintained. It's the one part of Southeast Asia that hasn't taken part in the so-called
*  Asian miracle. Not one of the Asian tigers. There's a reason for that. A good reason.
*  But these techniques, you can be confident that any state or a commercial enterprise,
*  any system of power, is going to use whatever technology is available to try to control and
*  dominate what amounts to its major enemy, namely the population. That's what power systems are
*  going to do. The scale of what was revealed, I think, was a little surprising. But it actually
*  shouldn't be. And there's more to come. Those of you who read technical journals, like say the MIT
*  technology review, should know what's coming. So for example, just in the tech review recently,
*  there have been articles on things like there and elsewhere on the hardware and computers,
*  which is now being designed, they blame China, but of course that means it's being done 10 times as
*  much here, to put in components in the hardware that will enable the manufacturer to record every
*  keystroke, everything that's happening on your computer. American businesses are worried because
*  if they have Chinese computers, they'll be picking it up at the People's Liberation Army.
*  But they don't point out that the American systems are doubtless much more advanced than doing the
*  same thing. Robotics is a field that's been worked on pretty hard for many years here, too.
*  And one of the goals, quite explicit, nothing secret, is to develop fly-sized drones, tiny robots
*  which can get on the ceiling of your living room and carry out constant surveillance.
*  And drones tend to go from surveillance to lethal capacities very quickly.
*  So we can expect that pretty soon. And these are things that are in development. Any system of power
*  is going to use them. And pretty strikingly, jihadis are going to use them. One of the things
*  we're doing right now is creating perfect technology for terrorist attacks. It's not a secret.
*  Take a look at drone technology. Right by today already, it's claimed that for $300,
*  you can purchase a small drone online. Now that's improving very fast. And for terrorist activities,
*  just perfect. If you want to get a picture of it, there's an article in this month's
*  leading journal of foreign affairs in Britain, the Royal Institute Journal of International
*  Affairs, describing how we are rapidly creating the technology to permit massive terrorist attacks
*  on ourselves. That's also typical. Power systems seek short-term power and domination. They are
*  not concerned with security. It's contrary to academic dogma. You can easily show that.
*  They're interested in power, domination, the welfare of their primary domestic constituencies,
*  which are concentrated wealth. And if there's a disaster in the long term, it's not their business.
*  You can show that. It's obvious with environmental issues. It's the same with nuclear weapons,
*  the same right now with drone technology. So sure, this stuff is going to go on,
*  unless we stop it. You can stop it too. It doesn't have to go on.
