# Noam Chomsky - Clash of Civilizations
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [December 12, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ7QbUPJkiA)
*  Now, let's get back to this clash of civilizations thing.
*  Huntington's, you know, everybody is flailing around
*  for some paradigm, you know, some big thing
*  that you can use to control people.
*  And Huntington's idea was clash of civilizations.
*  So, you know, there's Islam and us
*  and all these other things.
*  And the reason why the world,
*  the idea is the reason why the world is so disorderly
*  is because you've got all, you know, with the Cold War gone,
*  you've got all these ethnic groups killing each other
*  and so on.
*  Well, as usual, it's always a good idea to start
*  by asking about the facts.
*  Whenever you hear anything said very confidently,
*  the first thing that should come to mind is,
*  wait a minute, is that true?
*  You know?
*  So is it true?
*  I mean, is it true that there's more ethnic conflict now
*  than there was 20 years ago?
*  Well, take a look.
*  In most of the big conflicts that are going on
*  around the world are,
*  we're going on right through the Cold War,
*  like Burundi and Rwanda.
*  There were huge massacres going on in the early 70s.
*  Actually, I wrote about them at the time.
*  Nobody was talking about them because it wasn't interesting.
*  But they were there.
*  There are some, in fact, or take say, you know,
*  in fact, just about every one you pick goes way back.
*  Now, there are some that are new.
*  Those within the former Soviet system,
*  including Yugoslavia, you know,
*  within the old so-called communist system, yeah, they're new.
*  So like the war in Chechnya or, you know,
*  Azerbaijan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, you know, Tajikistan,
*  these things are all new.
*  But that's standard.
*  Anytime a tyrannical system breaks down,
*  you have all sorts of conflict internal to it.
*  Just take a look at the breakdown of the European empires.
*  Every single one was like that.
*  Most of them were worse.
*  So first of all, the factual basis is very thin.
*  Now, what about the principle clash of civilizations?
*  Like say, the big bad guy is Islam.
*  Well, there are a few problems with that.
*  Our, the most fundamentalist Islamic state in the world
*  is our big ally, Saudi Arabia.
*  How's that fit?
*  I mean, Saudi Arabia is a real,
*  it's not fundamentalist enough for some of the people in it,
*  but it's pretty extreme.
*  Are we trying to undermine Saudi Arabia?
*  Of course not.
*  And not only oil, you know.
*  In fact, there are clients.
*  That's a family dictatorship that we keep in power
*  because they make sure that the money from oil
*  doesn't go to the people of the region,
*  but goes to London and New York.
*  So they're okay.
*  There's no clash of civilizations there.
*  That's state fundamental.
*  What about individual, you know, like non-state?
*  Well, by far the worst ones are the guys
*  who are tearing Afghanistan to pieces.
*  You find more crazy Islamic fundamentalists around than them.
*  I don't know about them.
*  Where'd they get their power from?
*  Your pocket, you know.
*  They got $6 billion or so, it's claimed,
*  from the United States and Saudi Arabia through the 1980s.
*  Now they're tearing Afghanistan apart,
*  but it's nothing that we did.
*  We're only wonderful people.
*  Where is this clash of civilizations
*  between Islam and the West?
*  I don't see it.
*  I mean, Indonesia is a Islamic state.
*  Do you see us trying to undermine Indonesia?
*  I mean, a lot of rotten things in Indonesia,
*  like for example, wages are about half the level of China,
*  which is not so munificent.
*  Do you see us doing anything about that?
*  I mean, I think this is all farce, you know.
*  I mean, I don't mean to say total farce.
*  Like there must be a new paradigm, you know,
*  something that people can build their careers on
*  and write books about and so on and so forth,
*  which can then be turned into a device
*  of controlling people.
*  That part is true.
*  And maybe this will work,
*  or if it doesn't, you try something else.
*  Part of the legacy of Ronald Reagan,
*  during the Reagan years,
*  the Pakistan was ruled by the most awful
*  of its many horrible dictators, Ziyal Haq.
*  And he had two major policies.
*  One was to carry out radical Islamization of the country
*  with the funding of Saudi Arabia.
*  Saudi Arabia is the center of radical Islam
*  and also the center of funding of jihadism
*  and also the leading ally of the United States and Britain.
*  Traditionally, the US and Britain
*  have been supporting radical Islam throughout the region.
*  And there are good reasons for that.
*  And they continue to.
*  The reasons are to, you can tell it
*  from the internal documents,
*  British and American internal documents.
*  The reason is kind of a rational analysis.
*  The real threat, they say,
*  is the virus of secular nationalism.
*  That's dangerous.
*  Secular nationalism, say, NASA, for example,
*  can lead to the possibility of efforts
*  to try to take the resources of the region
*  and use them for their own populations
*  rather than for the benefit of the West
*  and the super-rich ruling families.
*  So that's a real problem.
*  And the only barrier to secular nationalism,
*  to the virus of secular nationalism, as it's called,
*  is radical Islamism.
*  So the US and Britain as well
*  have been strongly supporting radical Islam
*  for a long time and continue to.
*  It's a little ironic when you hear them
*  complaining about the Muslim Brotherhood,
*  which by comparison is moderate Islam.
*  And that remains true.
*  Saudi Arabia, for example, has given free reign
*  to crush demonstrations.
*  No talk of no-fly zones.
*  There was a day of rage called in Riyadh,
*  but the police presence was so extensive
*  that nobody could even show up.
*  They're too intimidated.
*  Same in Kuwait.
*  These are rich oil states, which have loyal dictators.
*  So therefore they're free to do anything they like.
