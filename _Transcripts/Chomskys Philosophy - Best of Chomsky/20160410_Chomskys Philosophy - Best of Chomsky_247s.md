# Noam Chomsky - Exposing Power to the Sunlight
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [April 10, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGciq1pulaA)
*  I think we should take a lesson from the powerful and the rich.
*  They understand this perfectly well.
*  That's why the population has to be kept in the dark.
*  Actually the professor of the science of government, I love that term, at Harvard, leading policy
*  intellectual, Samuel Huntington, once pointed out that power must remain in the dark, exposed
*  to the sunlight, it begins to evaporate.
*  And he's right.
*  That's what lies behind the kind of things I was talking about, much more about it here.
*  So one thing you can do is to expose power to the sunlight, and it will evaporate.
*  That's why the massive secrecy has to be maintained.
*  But that's not enough.
*  So the main power to the sunlight has to be a preliminary to the only thing that has ever worked in history,
*  mass popular organization.
*  And that has achieved results.
*  It has plenty of results.
*  Right now the Troika is trying to dismantle and destroy Europe's great post-war achievement,
*  the social democratic welfare state.
*  And they're pretty frank about it.
*  Mario Draghi, head of the central bank, said a couple of years ago that the social contract is dead.
*  It can't be maintained.
*  Why?
*  Not for economic reasons, just because they have the power to dismantle and destroy it.
*  Well, that doesn't have to happen.
*  The power is actually in the hands of people like you, but it's got to be exercised.
*  And that requires organization and action.
*  As an individual, you can do very little.
*  But when you get together, you can do almost anything.
*  And that's been demonstrated over and over again through history.
*  I mean, you mentioned Occupy, which is interesting and important.
*  I mean, if I had been asked myself, say, should people, should Occupy Zuccotti Park in New York,
*  my judgment would have been, it's pointless.
*  I was completely wrong.
*  It was very successful, remarkably successful.
*  Within days, weeks, there were hundreds of Occupy movements around the country, others in Europe.
*  I actually spoke at an Occupy event in Sydney, Australia.
*  They were all over the place.
*  It lit a spark, which had a real impact, and it changed a lot of things.
*  It changed the discourse, put inequality on the agenda for the first time,
*  and now phrases like 1%, 99%, just a common coin.
*  But remember that Occupy was a tactic.
*  Tactics, it wasn't a movement.
*  It's a tactic that has, every tactic has diminishing returns.
*  You can't keep doing it over and over.
*  And this one in particular couldn't be continued.
*  You cannot occupy a central square, say, in New York or Boston over the winter.
*  It's just impossible.
*  You're sitting under five feet of snow, you know, but then the population won't accept it after a time.
*  So it has to turn into a movement, and to some extent it has.
*  But I think that's the answer to your question.
*  There's no magic tricks.
*  That's the one that's worked all through history.
*  It's made real achievements.
*  There's always regression.
*  Power systems don't say, thank you, we're going to give you the power.
*  They try to maintain themselves.
*  And that's class struggle.
*  It goes on through history, and it will continue.
