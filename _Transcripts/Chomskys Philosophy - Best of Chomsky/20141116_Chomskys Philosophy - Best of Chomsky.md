# Noam Chomsky on Austerity
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [November 16, 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ROExrJDbNg)
*  The consequences of the austerity agenda are pretty obvious.
*  They're in Europe where they're being imposed more strictly.
*  They're devastating the societies.
*  These are rich societies.
*  They're increasing debt as anticipated.
*  They're creating a huge number of unemployed.
*  In the United States, which is in this case more progressive than Europe,
*  they're being applied but less rigorously and they're having a milder version of the same effects.
*  It's not because people want it.
*  So like in the United States, for example, there's plenty of polls.
*  The general population considers the main problem to be unemployment, not deficit.
*  And they're right.
*  In fact, the deficit is probably a good idea right now.
*  It's a stimulus to the economy and it's a way to create more jobs.
*  Even the IMF is coming around to accept this.
*  So who wants austerity?
*  Well, bankers, rich people, the people who run the world.
*  They want austerity.
*  One reason is, you know, they're concerned, they're lenders.
*  So they're concerned that maybe somewhere down the road, invisible now, there might be inflation,
*  which is bad for people who lend and good for people who borrow.
*  So they don't want to take that chance.
*  And the other is that the austerity programs have the nice effect of dismantling the hated welfare state.
*  And that's bipartisan in the United States.
*  Obama's talking about it too.
*  You got to go after the poor.
*  In fact, like take my getting here today.
*  Okay, I flew.
*  Well, there's one part, this sequestration, which is about the deficit, not unemployment,
*  the big problem, it's got a kind of a nuanced character to it.
*  It leaves out rich people.
*  So one of the things that's excluded from the by congressional decision from the sequester is
*  air flying, flying, you got to have enough flight controllers so that rich people don't
*  have to wait a little bit when the plane comes.
*  On the other hand, poor people who let's say his kids are being thrown at head start and
*  can't get Medicaid.
*  Well, you know, minor problem.
*  So it's adjusted the sequester for and you know who flies, it's not the general population,
*  it's privileged people overwhelmingly.
*  And that's typical.
*  That's the way the country works.
*  And it's the way the public sees things.
*  So this recent studies came out by good political scientists, Ben Page and Larry Bartels,
*  which they just studied attitudes towards deficit, austerity and jobs ranked by income level.
*  And it's exactly as you predict the very top of the income scale.
*  The problem is deficit.
*  So we have to have austerity.
*  The rest of the population doesn't agree.
*  And we don't have a functioning democracy.
*  We live in a plutocracy.
*  But roughly 70% of the population, lower 70%, their views have no influence on policy.
*  They're disenfranchised.
*  And you get more influence as you go up the scale at the very top.
*  That means, you know, tenth of 1%, you know, basically go what you want.
*  Well, what they want is they don't care if kids don't have schools or, you know,
*  don't get Medicaid or don't have Head Start.
*  They want to make profit.
*  And they want to get rid of this annoying welfare state.
*  And it's even said, you know, Mario Draghi is the head of the European Central Bank
*  and has been one of the more forthcoming about trying to do something about the crisis.
*  He had an interview with the Wall Street Journal in which he told the journal that
*  he said the European social contract is dead.
*  Social contract means, you know, the welfare state,
*  one of Europe's great contributions to civilization in the past years.
*  They can now kind of dismantle it.
*  He didn't say he wanted that.
*  He just said that's what's happening.
*  And yeah, that's what's happening.
