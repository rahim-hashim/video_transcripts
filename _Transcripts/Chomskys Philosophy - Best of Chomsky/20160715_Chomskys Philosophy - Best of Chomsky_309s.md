# Noam Chomsky - Thought Without Language
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [July 15, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YXXGHwmogU)
*  Language often falls short for many of us.
*  And we sometimes refer to foreign language
*  to try to explain something.
*  Why is it that my thinking process or my experiential
*  process cannot be articulated with language?
*  Where is that disconnect?
*  Well, each language, first of all, I think altogether,
*  I think all of us know that language does not give us
*  the full capacity, maybe anywhere near the capacity,
*  to express what we're thinking, feeling, hoping for,
*  you know, whatever.
*  There's an awful lot of thought that goes on that just
*  doesn't come out the mouth and probably can't.
*  I mean, when you introspect, you can see this.
*  So for example, here's a topic that hasn't been studied,
*  but should.
*  People are talking to themselves all the time.
*  You can't prevent yourself from talking to yourself.
*  Actually, I don't know if that's true of signers.
*  Do signers sign to themselves all the time?
*  All the time, yeah.
*  OK.
*  But you've seen it.
*  You've seen it.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, you just can't prevent yourself from doing it.
*  It takes a tremendous act of will.
*  Now, if you pay attention, at least when I pay attention,
*  to what I think I'm doing, it is externalized language,
*  like I can tell whether two words rhyme.
*  But I think it's fragments.
*  I mean, at least what I think I'm doing
*  is sort of fragments come to mind, you know,
*  a word, another word.
*  And all of a sudden, I know exactly what the thought is.
*  And I can express it.
*  Well, if that's true, that means that the thinking is going on.
*  The bits of externalized language
*  are kind of spurring you to express it.
*  And then you can express whatever it is you're thinking.
*  But even with all of that, there's a lot of stuff
*  you just can't express.
*  That's why we, you know, people write poems.
*  And that's why we have literature and art and music
*  and all sorts of other things.
*  And that does something, but not enough.
*  As for looking at other languages,
*  there are sometimes concepts that do have a,
*  kind of like the most just, you know, the right word.
*  It happens like that.
*  Happens to be in another language.
*  It doesn't happen to be an expression of English.
*  And there are things like that, you know,
*  Schadenfreude, you know, angst and stuff like that.
*  So there are cases where some other language
*  just happens to have the concept that you're looking for.
*  But there are plenty of cases where, at least my feeling is,
*  where no language does.
*  And we just can't begin to exhaust the content of our
*  thoughts, feelings, emotions, and so on.
*  I think everybody knows this from their own experience.
*  It's not studied much.
*  And one of the reasons it's not studied is because of the
*  pervasiveness of certain dogmas, like the kinds I mentioned,
*  that nothing can be going on unless you're conscious of it,
*  or at least you can become conscious of it.
*  That's a very deep-seated conviction in philosophy and psychology.
*  I mean, I've looked, maybe some of you know better,
*  but I can find almost nothing in the history of thought that
*  raised the question that there are unconscious thoughts.
*  And, incidentally, that includes Freud, as far as,
*  and there's a debate about this.
*  But if you, as far as I read Freud, he, I think,
*  when he talks about the unconscious,
*  I don't think he means by it inaccessible to consciousness.
*  In fact, the whole technique of psychoanalysis wouldn't make
*  sense on that assumption.
*  So it's as if it's there somehow, and you can bring it to consciousness.
*  But the idea that there's something, that there's stuff
*  going on that is completely unconscious, that's rarely discussed.
*  I mean, there's some in Jung, there's some in Vico, but not much.
*  And I suspect that this bears on current work that's being done.
*  Like, there was some very interesting work that came out recently.
*  Some of you will remind me, I forgot the name of the experimenter,
*  which was all publicized all over the place.
*  Someone found that before you make a decision, let's say, to lift your hand,
*  there's something going on in the motor cortex that would be connected
*  with lifting your hand.
*  I forget who the guy was who did this.
*  This was interpreted all over the place as being an argument
*  against freedom of will.
*  It isn't that at all.
*  All it's saying is that decisions are unconscious.
*  So you make a decision before it becomes conscious.
*  You already, something's going on.
*  So all the problems remain exactly as they were.
*  But you learn something you should have guessed anyhow,
*  that things are happening that just aren't accessible to consciousness.
*  Why should they be anywhere in the rigidity principle?
