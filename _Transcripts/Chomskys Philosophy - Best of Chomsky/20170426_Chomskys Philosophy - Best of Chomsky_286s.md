# Noam Chomsky - Consciousness of Subordination
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [April 26, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hffHBYWBVC8)
*  We should be cautious about trying to sketch out the nature of a future society in too
*  much detail.
*  It's not that it can't be done.
*  It can be done.
*  It can be done in interesting ways, different ways, and has been done.
*  But I think the real question is to what extent is it important to do it and to what extent
*  is it important to just try an experiment and chip away at existing structures and so
*  on.
*  Actually, another problem which I think must be faced is that at any particular point in
*  human history, people have not understood what is oppression.
*  It's something you learn.
*  I mean, if I go back to my parents and my grandmother, she didn't think she was oppressed
*  by being in a super patriarchal family where the father would walk down the street and
*  not recognize his daughter when she came because you're not supposed to, not because you didn't
*  know who she was, because you don't know your daughter.
*  It didn't feel like oppression.
*  It just felt like the way life works.
*  What psychic effects it had internally, that's a complicated question.
*  As anyone involved in any kind of activism knows, say the women's movement, one of the
*  first tasks is to get people to understand that they're living under conditions of oppression
*  and domination.
*  It isn't obvious.
*  And who knows what forms of oppression and domination we're just accepting without even
*  noticing them.
*  And at some further stage of self-enlightenment and communal understanding, we'll recognize
*  those are things we have to deal with and we can't plan for them if we don't know about
*  them.
*  Linked to that, then, Emma Goldman, as she grew older and feared for the fact that it
*  may not be an immediate revolution, became very influenced by, I think, Gustav Landauer,
*  who talked about that the state isn't just out there, it's inside us, that we have to
*  become ourselves as free as we can be in capitalism.
*  That in fact, she was always worried that there may be a chance that people won't be
*  ready for revolution and that there is a way of developing the politics of the personal.
*  So maybe more people could be ready to experience that life that's possible.
*  That's quite true.
*  I mean, people, in fact, there are, you know, the people who understand this the best are
*  who are carrying out the control and domination in the more free societies like the United
*  States and England, where popular struggles have won a lot of freedom over the years and
*  the state has limited capacity to coerce.
*  It is very striking that it's precisely in those societies that elite groups, the business
*  world, the state managers and so on, recognized early on that they are going to have to develop
*  massive methods of control of attitude and opinion because you can't control people by
*  force anymore and therefore you have to modify their consciousness so they don't perceive
*  that they are living under conditions of alienation, oppression, subordination and
*  so on.
*  In fact, that's what, I mean, you know, probably a couple trillion dollars a year spent on
*  this in the United States, very self-consciously.
*  I mean, from the framing of television advertisements for two-year-olds to what you taught in graduate
*  school economics programs.
*  It's designed to create a kind of a consciousness of subordination and it's also intended specifically
*  and pretty consciously to suppress normal human emotions.
*  So normal human emotions are sympathy and solidarity, I mean, not just for people, I
*  mean, for stranded dolphins, you know.
*  It's just a normal reaction of people.
*  If you go back to, say, the classical political economists, people like Adam Smith, this was
*  just taking the brand, it was the core of human nature and society's got to deal with
*  this.
*  Well, you know, one of the main concentrations of advertising and education is to drive that
*  out of your mind.
