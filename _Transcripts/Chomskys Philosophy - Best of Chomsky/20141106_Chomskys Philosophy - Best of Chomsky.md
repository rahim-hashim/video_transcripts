# Noam Chomsky - Animal Rights/Talent
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [November 06, 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDcVz4daPQE)
*  I am perturbed by two questions of moral philosophy. The first one is concerning Peter Singer.
*  Is he right on animal rights? And my second question is on inequities at birth. We can't
*  redistribute IQ, height, good looks, talent. We can redistribute wealth and income. Does
*  this have any moral significance at all? Thank you.
*  Out of curiosity, do you kill insects like mosquitoes when they are bothering you? Or
*  do you think that when mosquitoes are carrying malaria we ought to develop means to kill
*  them off? Question. Okay, that's part of the answer. Sure, animals should have rights.
*  But none of us believes that animals, including Peter Singer, that animals should have the
*  rights of human beings. And there are good reasons for that. Rights don't exist in a
*  vacuum if you're talking about moral philosophy. Rights are associated with responsibilities.
*  We don't attribute any responsibilities at all to other animals, do we? We don't say
*  that a lion has to be sent to the gas chamber if it kills a gazelle, let's say. They don't
*  have responsibilities. And that, of course, in moral philosophy, now just abstract discussion,
*  relates to the question of what their rights are. And they should have rights. So for example,
*  it's a step forward in our general kind of moral development that animals are not subjected
*  to torture in the way they were just a few years ago. So in Britain and the United States,
*  they're now constraints on the torture, what we call experiment, torture of at least animals
*  that are closer to us, like primates, than there were 30 or 40 years ago. So yes, we're
*  developing some sort of conception of rights, but I don't think anyone thinks that animals have
*  the rights and responsibilities of human beings. Okay, then we can enter into the details. What
*  was the second question? Oh yeah, about IQ? Not about general gifts that we are born with.
*  Okay, I mean, like, you know, somebody asked me before to sign a picture and told me that
*  she had only once before asked someone to sign a picture, some tennis champion. Okay,
*  well, I'm never going to be a tennis champion. So good. I'm not sorry that he has those talents,
*  which I don't have. I mean, I'm not sorry that people can play the violin in ways I can't dream
*  of or, and so on. I think that's great. Otherwise it'd be extremely boring world. So yes, people
*  have all sorts of qualities and capacities. I think you mentioned IQ. That's one of the least
*  significant of them. I mean, whatever it is, it's some very marginal phenomena. Okay, anyone
*  on that side? But there are real ones and I think it's great. Sure, there should be a very complex
*  world in which people can do different things and we can admire and enjoy what they do.
