# Noam Chomsky - Libertarianism
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [July 15, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbouhVto1MY)
*  Libertarian conceptions basically come out of classical liberalism, 17th, 18th century
*  classical liberalism.
*  And the core principles of classical liberalism were opposition to illegitimate authority.
*  People should be free from constraints and controls by authoritarian structures which
*  have no inherent legitimacy.
*  Basically one or another form of tyranny or domination.
*  So in the early days they were concerned with feudalism, with tyrannical states and so on.
*  By the late 19th century on through the 20th century, some of the major authoritarian
*  illegitimate structures are the corporate system, the private tyrannies.
*  Liberation is basically a tyranny dominated from the top, take orders from above, given
*  down below, at the bottom you can rent yourself.
*  It doesn't even tend to have anything like popular democratic control.
*  The so-called libertarian movement in the United States, which incidentally people I
*  often have friends who agree with them on that.
*  But their policies, whatever their goals may be, their policies tend to drive people
*  under the control of the worst possible form of tyranny, unaccountable private tyranny.
*  And that's the opposite of libertarianism.
*  There's one crucial difference between American libertarianism and traditional libertarianism.
*  Traditionally libertarianism was opposed to any form of dominance in hierarchy.
*  One of the slogans was no God, no master, meaning no ecclesiastical dominance, no masters
*  in industry and personal life and families anywhere else.
*  American libertarianism is quite different.
*  It's perfectly happy to support masters.
*  In fact, it extols them.
*  It's in favor of it.
*  It wants no interference with the domination and control of people in the workforce, let's say.
*  That's very counter to traditional libertarianism, either in Europe or, for that matter, in the United States.
*  If you go back to the 19th century, early days of the Industrial Revolution, there were
*  mass popular movements which had their own journals.
*  You could read what they said and so on.
*  They were just spontaneous.
*  They were opposed to the way in which the industrial system was forcing them to turn into tools of production
*  under someone else's control and destroying their independence as free people, also destroying their culture.
*  Their slogan was those who work in the military should own them.
*  That was taken for granted.
*  In fact, what they called wage slavery, wage labor, they regarded as not very different from chattel slavery.
*  That was such a popular position in the United States in the 19th century that it was a slogan of the Republican Party.
*  Wage labor is tolerable because it's temporary, but people should control their own industrial fate.
*  This is, as Americans, apple pie and quite different from what's called libertarianism today.
*  These are important things to bear in mind.
