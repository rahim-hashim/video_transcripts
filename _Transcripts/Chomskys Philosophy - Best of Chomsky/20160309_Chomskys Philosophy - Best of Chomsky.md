# Noam Chomsky - Language, Morality, and Human Nature
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [March 09, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXwdlzvkwRA)
*  People are interested in linguistics for all sorts of reasons, but my own interest for
*  since the beginning for 50 years has been
*  as a way of exploring some aspects of human
*  higher mental faculties and ultimately of human nature
*  which should show up in every domain not just in language happens to be one of the few areas where you can study
*  very core human capacities unique and core human capacities in a
*  very intense way and
*  achieve some
*  Non results that go beyond superficial understanding in most areas. It's very hard to do it, but this is one area in which you can
*  and
*  At the core of this capacity for language. It's been recognized for centuries
*  Is a kind of what was sometimes called a creative aspect
*  the free ability to do it you and I are doing to
*  Express their thoughts without limit within constraints, but without limit in
*  Novel ways and so on that somehow a fundamental part of human nature
*  Core of Cartesian philosophy was this ability for example well similar questions arise in every aspect of
*  Human capacity and again, it's traditional so David Hume
*  250 years ago pointed out that the foundation of morals
*  Must be what we nowadays called generative grammar
*  He didn't call it that but it must be some set of principles that we're capable of applying in novel situations
*  Again without limit and he pointed out these principles have to be part of our nature
*  Because there's no way to acquire them from experience
*  in theory you can learn something about these aspects of human nature and that
*  moving over to the
*  Domain of human affairs including politics, but personal life or anything else
*  Anyone who may takes any stand on anything I say if you're in favor of
*  keeping things the way they are or some minor reform or
*  Revolution or whatever it may be
*  I mean if you're serious about it if you're acting as a
*  Kind of a moral agent you think what you do should meet certain minimal moral standards
*  You're taking that position because you think it's it's good for people. It's going to somehow
*  Conform it's going to bring out and
*  Amplify and offer possibilities for their fundamental nature to express itself well at that point
*  There's a theoretical connection, but it's pretty abstract
*  Because when you deal with anything as complex as human beings you're always on the surface
*  In fact we can't answer questions like this about insects
*  We a long time if ever before
*  One can have anything like scientific understanding of any questions like these
