# Noam Chomsky - Early Life and Influences
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [October 10, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwRT02AxoJ0)
*  My father was, they were both first-generation immigrants. My father came when he was about
*  17, he came in 1913 from the Ukraine. He came essentially to escape the Tsar's draft, which
*  was almost a death sentence for Jewish boys. They lived in a village which was later wiped
*  out by the Nazis, nothing left. And he, when he came to the United States, didn't know
*  any English. He worked in a sweatshop in Baltimore, managed to get to learn the language, got
*  some education, finally went to Johns Hopkins, got a degree, ended up a pretty important
*  Hebrew scholar, did a lot of work on medieval Hebrew grammar. In fact, when I was a child,
*  I was reading the draft of his dissertation on David Kimchey, a 13th century medieval
*  grammarian. And he went on to be an educator, kind of a Deweyite educator, and ran, taught in
*  Hebrew college and then the graduate university of Jewish studies in Philadelphia, Dropsy College,
*  that's my father. My mother was also an immigrant. She came when she was a baby, about a year old,
*  and she came from what's now Belarus. Her family was in New York. Both families were
*  extreme super-orthodox. I mean, I remember my mother telling me that when she was with
*  her friends in the streets of New York, a young teenager, if she saw her father coming towards
*  them, they would cross the street because she didn't want to be embarrassed in front of her
*  friends by having her father pass by and act as if he didn't recognize her, mere girl. She was
*  very smart, independent, but she couldn't go to college. That's only for boys, so her younger
*  brother was allowed to go to college, but she could only go to normal school. She became a teacher,
*  an educator, also a Hebrew educator, wrote books. Actually, the two of us even wrote a play together
*  once in Hebrew, but she became a pretty influential educator in the Hebrew, I wouldn't say ghetto isn't
*  exactly the right word, but there was, where we, they lived in Philadelphia where I grew up,
*  there was a segment of the Jewish community, mostly first-generation immigrants who were
*  deeply engaged in revival of Hebrew, revival of modernization of Jewish culture. They wanted
*  to split from the diaspora tradition of Eastern Europe. And split from Yiddish? Yeah, both my
*  parents, their native language was Yiddish, but they wouldn't let us hear a word, so all I learned
*  of Yiddish was what everybody learns from Woody Allen or a secret language of your parents. You
*  drop the Yiddish word into your public performances though, don't you? Occasionally. So who influenced
*  you the most politically, mum or dad? Politically, really neither. I mean, they were, this is the
*  30s, so they were fairly conventional New Deal Democrats. I mean, I can remember listening to
*  Roosevelt's fireside chats on Friday evening, I think Friday evening, there was a kind of a mood
*  of calm settling over the family, you know, everything's going to be okay. But the influences
*  on me politically, to the extent they came from the family, came from different part of the family.
*  My mother's relatives were all in New York. New York's a short train ride from Philadelphia,
*  by the time I got old enough to travel myself, about 11 or 12, I'd take the train to New York
*  all the time, stay with a couple of my relatives. And they were working class mostly, most of them
*  unemployed at the time. And there was a pretty lively, there was a very lively working class
*  culture in the 1930s, sort of forgotten. But my uncle, one uncle, who was maybe the biggest
*  influence on my life at that age, actually never went past fourth grade. And others had some
*  education, but not much. Your uncle was a Trotskyite, wasn't he? He had been through every
*  sect that there was and had rejected them all. But so he wasn't, he was an ex-Trotskyite, but an
*  ex everything else as well. You were never seduced by the Communist Party in the Soviet Union,
*  William. At the time I was about 12 years old. I was not only anti-Stalinist, but anti-Leninist
*  from the left. And I was being led towards the anarchist movements and towards the left Marxists.
*  There was a major component of the Marx tradition, which was very critical of Bolshevism from the
*  left. There was another one from the right, the Menchewiks. But there was an important one on the
*  left, people like Anton Panacuk, who was one of the leading intellectuals of the social democracy,
*  but a left critic of Bolshevism and others. And those are the people I read. And they were not too
*  far from the components of the anarchist movement. They were sort of close to the anarcho-syndicalists,
*  who I was also interested in. And I became very much interested in the Spanish Revolution right
*  around 1940. Well, that was one of your, the impulse to write pretty much your first column
*  or your first article when you were 10. I don't know if it was the first one, but it was an early
*  one. I was the editor of the fourth grade newspaper, probably the only reader, except maybe for my
*  mother. I don't know. But I did write an article, which I sort of half remember, right after the
*  fall of Barcelona. So that would have been about February 1939. It wasn't specifically about the
*  Spanish Civil War. It was about the rise of, the spread of fascism in Europe, which seemed, as a
*  child, it seemed very frightening and ominous. I mean, you know, I listened to Hitler's speeches on
*  the radio. I didn't understand anything, but you could pick up the mood and the threat and sort of
*  knew some of the things that were happening. And the article was about the fall of Austria,
*  then Czechoslovakia, and now Spain. It looked as, at the time, it looked as if fascism was unstoppable,
*  it was going to spread over the world. It was frightening in itself, but it also had a, it tied
*  in with personal experiences, which incidentally my parents never even knew about. Those days,
*  you didn't talk to your parents about personal things. Not that these boys didn't. It's not done.
*  But we lived in a neighborhood where we were the only Jewish family. And the neighborhood was
*  pretty pro-fascist. Partly it was Irish Catholic, and they just hated the British, and partly it
*  was German. They were pro-Nazi. But as a boy in the streets, you get to run into these things.
*  And I grew up with just a visceral fear of Catholics. I knew when the kids came out of
*  the Catholic school down the street, they were going to be raving anti-Semites. And maybe later
*  in the afternoon, they'd calm down, play ball or something. But it's just part of experience was
*  fear of violently anti-Semitic, mostly Catholic kids coming from this Jesuit school.
*  Well, with this momentum, with this background, why didn't you study politics when you went to
*  university? Why did you suddenly opt for linguistics? I didn't study politics because
*  I really didn't believe in what was being taught. I thought I had better insight from other sources.
*  And I, in retrospect, think that was probably a wise decision. Actually, I got into linguistics
*  through political contacts. It's just a personal story. I don't know if it's of any general
*  interest. Well, I'd love to hear it. I went to a Deweyite experimental school. As I said,
*  my father was very much interested in Dewey's educational theories and practiced them. It was
*  run by Temple University Education Department, which happened to be a progressive education
*  department. It was a terrific school. I was there from infancy, really, about 18 months old, since
*  my parents worked until high school, so until 12. And it was a very exciting experience.
*  There was no, you weren't graded. There were no ranking. Actually, I didn't know I was a good
*  student until I got into high school. I knew I had skipped a grade, but okay, it just meant I was the
*  smallest kid in the class. Nobody paid any attention to it. And it did, the teachers kind of
*  inspired the creative work, often cooperative. You worked with other people or you just pursued
*  your own interests. It was a curriculum. You followed it. And I can remember the school very
*  well. Then I got into the academic high school. There's one academic high school in the city,
*  actually two, one for boys, one for girls. My wife went, future wife went to the girls one.
*  And it was kind of like a black hole. I don't remember a thing. Everything was graded.
*  Had to pass exams. Everything was ranked. It was extremely boring. I was looking forward to going
*  to college, the local college. Of course, there's no thought of going anywhere else. You live at home,
*  you work, you go to college. And I looked, I was 16 when I got into college and the
*  catalog looked very exciting. I was going to take courses in Greek, this, that, all kind of
*  exciting stuff. When I started to take the courses, I discovered it's high school. It's just boring,
*  routine. And I was ready to drop out after about a year. I didn't see any point going on.
*  And I happened to run into, through political contact, through left, what's now would be called
*  anti-Zionist. Then it was Zionist, left Zionist, anti-state radical activism. I ran into
*  a professor at the- This is Zellig Harris.
*  Zellig Harris, who was very much involved in these things. In fact, was at the center of
*  many of these movements and had a big influence on a lot of young Jewish intellectuals at the period.
*  He didn't write much, so nobody knows about it. He was very influential and kind of a
*  charismatic person. I got to know him and he, in retrospect, I think he was trying to convince me
*  to get back into college. He didn't say anything, but he just suggested that I start taking some of
*  his graduate courses. So I took them and- Isn't life serendipitous?
*  Strange. Absolutely arbitrary in a way.
*  The whole thing for me is totally so. I don't even have professional qualifications,
*  which is why I'm teaching at MIT. They didn't care, but I had no professional qualifications
*  in any field. Through Harris' influence, I started taking graduate- He directed me to faculty members
*  at the university who were pretty exciting people, but in different fields. One was in mathematics,
*  another in philosophy, and I ended up with a strange hodgepodge of-
*  Well, you did pretty well because you finished up as institutional professor
*  and professor emeritus of linguistic and philosophy at MIT, which isn't too bad for
*  a sort of an autodidact. It was serendipitous, as you say. It's mostly accidental. When I got out of-
*  I did go for four years at Harvard Graduate Work Society Fellows, kind of a graduate
*  sub-institution at Harvard for select students, and that was very free also. It was kind of like
*  elementary school again. When I was finished with that, I had no profession, and I had no
*  particular job prospects. I had friends at MIT, and they just suggested that I get a job in the
*  electronics lab. I can't tell a radio from a tape recorder to this day if something goes wrong with
*  my computer. I have to check with my grandchildren. I had an interview with the head of the
*  research lab electronics. The person became pretty well known, Jerry Wiesner. He became
*  Kennedy's science advisor shortly after. We had an interview. He was talking about what I was
*  interested in. He thought it was interesting. He suggested that I work in a project that they had
*  there on machine translation, and I told him I thought it was a silly project and I wasn't
*  going to work on it. The way to solve it was just brute force. There was nothing else you could do,
*  which turned out to be correct years later. But he thought that was a pretty good answer. He said,
*  okay, why don't you just work on what you're interested in? It kind of went on from there.
*  But it was luck. Otherwise, I would never have ended up in the academic world.
*  It's interesting that even if you had never made a public utterance on matters political,
*  that you were going to be a trailblazer because I vividly recall your great contribution,
*  your great theoretical contribution to the notion of language, that it is innate and not learnt.
*  You argued, discovered the role of hormones in the emergence of human language in much the same
*  way as hormones play such a part in the emergence of puberty. In a sense, that's correct. There was
*  a kind of a general atmosphere in Cambridge mass, which was all over the place, but in Cambridge,
*  it was kind of the peak. In philosophy, social sciences, psychology, linguistics,
*  practically all fields, it was called behavioral science. There was a belief,
*  there was an interesting period that in American life altogether, it was an interesting period.
*  It's worth remembering that before the Second World War, the United States was far and away
*  the richest country in the world, but it really wasn't a major player in world affairs. Britain
*  was the dominant power. Intellectually, it was kind of a backwater. If you wanted to study physics or
*  philosophy or math, you went to Germany or England. If you wanted to be a writer, you went to Paris.
*  The United States was like Central Isle. You wanted to get out if you wanted to do anything,
*  so much so that after the Second World War, when I was teaching at MIT,
*  we were still teaching French and German to the graduate students because as a holdover from the
*  pre-war period, they had to know them because that's where the work was. The Second World War
*  changed all that dramatically. Power shifted to the United States. It became the major
*  technological center, intellectual center. A lot of European emigres came. They fled
*  fascism. Europe was devastated. There was a kind of a Rome-Greece attitude towards Europe.
*  Their personal timing was perfect.
*  Your personal timing was perfect.
*  Luck had it, but it was more than that. There was a sense in the United States in the 50s,
*  if you read back the literature then, that we can discard all of that old-fashioned stuff.
*  That was all old European stuff. We're going to do it the right way. We're Americans. We'll
*  do everything from scratch. It had an objective basis. The United States at that time was
*  you know by far the it had literally half the world's wealth and incredible security.
*  It was in a position to dominate the world and planners knew it. There were careful plans laid
*  for running the world, but in the intellectual spheres and it was kind of at its peak in places
*  like Cambridge, Harvard, MIT and so on, there was a sense that we can start everything all over.
*  And there were a lot of new discoveries. In the early 1950s, there was discovery of DNA.
*  Okay, we've somehow... In the 1930s, there was and it included a major American scientist,
*  Linus Pauling. It became possible to unify chemistry and physics with the new quantum theory.
*  And that was a step forward. And during the war, a lot of technological development. After the war
*  came in the late 40s information theory, which looked like could be a unifying concept for the
*  human sciences. And then came radical behaviorism, Skinner's work, the 40s that looked like kind of
*  the answer to human behavior. A couple of years later came Crick and Watson's discovery of DNA.
*  It looked as if somehow biology was going to be integrated into chemistry, which already somehow
*  had a link to physics. And the concept of unified science, you know, we can unify all of science and
*  march on, was very dominant. It's still just beyond their reach, isn't it? It would seem forever.
*  There's a lot more modesty now and properly. In the human sciences, including linguistics,
*  there was a sense that everything was basically solved, you know, with just kind of
*  few touches here and there. But the basic ideas are understood. The most influential philosopher
*  of the period happened to be at Harvard, W. V. Quine, one of the very influential philosophers.
*  His view was that, as he put it, language is just essentially an arbitrary collection of
*  conditioned responses. It's a fabric of sentences connected to one another and to stimuli by
*  conditioned response and skierian lines. And that was virtually dogma. That, together with
*  information theory, you know, the computers were just coming along. It looked as if it would be
*  possible to automate analytic techniques. That's where the machine translation interest came from.
*  There were a couple of us, actually three grad students, who didn't believe a word of it,
*  at Harvard in the early 50s. And we tried to work out our own views. One of them died some years
*  ago. He was the founder of modern biology of language and others, my office mate still,
*  after 60 years at MIT. He's retired also. But we thought, first of all, that with regard to language,
*  that the core problems were just being ignored and not even studied. I mean, the core, the most
*  elementary property of language, when you think about it, and it was kind of understood in the
*  17th and 18th century, is that the core is a capacity which all humans share and no other
*  organism has to act creatively with language to produce an unbounded number of expressions
*  which have very specific meaning and very specific sound, not determined by stimuli, either external
*  or internal, appropriate to situations, not caused by them, intelligible to others who recognize that
*  they could have expressed the same thought the same way that had occurred to them before,
*  and it can go on without bounds. It's a kind of an elementary aspect of human nature, and a very
*  distinctive one. If you go back to say Descartes, that was kind of the core of Cartesian philosophy,
*  and it spread and found its way into all sorts of directions, like classical liberalism,
*  and much enlightenment thought. A lot of it's been forgotten since, but it was quite real.
*  Then it was forgotten in the 19th century, then the 20th century became much, became turned into
*  what I just described, kind of behavioral science analysis of data and so on, but it was missing all
*  of these points. And then the three of you come along, and? Well, the three of us, you know, just
*  a couple of other friends, you know, it was mainly the three of us, thought first of all that this
*  ought to be the core problem for the study of language. And the other thing we thought was that
*  language should not be divorced from biology, that the capacity for language is a biological
*  capacity, much like say the visual system or the immune system and so on, just some subsystem of the
*  cognitive faculties, which should be studied, can be studied on its own, but also integrated with
*  others, that later came to be called biolinguistics. And pursuing those two directions, a new approach
*  to language and cognitive science sort of began to develop with an interaction with this around the
*  same time. It's still a very conflicted, it's not that everyone accepts it by any means.
*  I'm aware of that. You are under constant attack in that area of your life as you are,
*  as you are politically. It's a contested area, but I think it, I don't really think there's much,
*  shouldn't be much controversy about it, but out of that came, and then MIT just became the center of
*  it. We were all at MIT and one of us, Eric Lenneberg, went off to medical school and
*  worked on biology of language. And Mars Halley is, as I said, still my office mate after all
*  these years. And we developed a department and students came and so on and so forth,
*  spread all over the world. And you were able to demonstrate, quite convincingly, that the capacity
*  to learn language was at its greatest when the human being is pretty young.
*  It was kind of known intuitively, but as the topic became studied much more intensively, actually,
*  some of the best works done by a couple of scientists who are right here now, Stephen Crane
*  and Ross Thornton. By now there's intensive study of acquisition of language and yet,
*  like other biological capacities, it appears to have what's called a critical period.
*  It functions almost reflexively at a certain stage of life. Later stages, it
*  gets damn side harder, doesn't it? It has to be done differently. There are individual differences,
*  but it's generally true.
