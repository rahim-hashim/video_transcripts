# Noam Chomsky - Innate Language
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [October 06, 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyaDTxGC-wI)
*  My own studies in language and human cognition demonstrate to me at least what remarkable
*  creativity ordinary people have.
*  The very fact that people talk to one another is a reflection, just in a normal way, I don't
*  mean anything particularly fancy, reflects deep-seated features of human creativity which
*  in fact separate human beings from any other biological system we know.
*  Noam Chomsky, theorist of language and political activist, has had an extraordinary career.
*  I can think of none like it in recent American history and few anywhere at any time.
*  He has literally transformed the subject of linguistics.
*  At the same time he's become one of the most consistent critics of power politics in all
*  its protean guises.
*  Scholar and propagandist, his two careers apparently reinforce each other.
*  In 1957 he published his Syntactic Structures which began what has frequently been called
*  the Chomskyian Revolution in Linguistics.
*  Like a latter-day Copernicus, Chomsky proposed a radically new way of looking at the theory
*  of grammar.
*  Chomsky worked out the formal rules of the universal grammar which generated the specific
*  rules of actual or natural languages.
*  The general approach I'm taking seems to me rather simple-minded and unsatisficated but
*  nevertheless correct.
*  Later he came to argue that such systems are innate features of human beings.
*  They belong to the characteristics of the species and have been in effect programmed
*  into the genetic equipment of the mind like the machine language in a computer.
*  One needn't be interested in this question.
*  Of course I am interested in it.
*  And the interesting question from this point of view would be what is the nature of the
*  initial state?
*  That is, what is human nature in this respect?
*  That in turn explains the...
*  Astonishing...
*  Let me try that next time.
*  Facility?
*  Facility.
*  Facility.
*  Facility.
*  That in turn explains the astonishing facility that children have in learning the rules of
*  natural language, no matter how complicated.
*  The language is created incredibly quickly from what are imperfect and often degenerate
*  samples.
*  Complicated.
*  Complicated.
*  It's a complicated word.
*  Do you know what complicated means?
*  It means it's complicated.
*  If in fact our minds were a blank slate and experience wrote on them, we would be very
*  impoverished creatures indeed.
*  So the obvious hypothesis is that our language is the result of the unfolding of a genetically
*  determined program.
*  Well, plainly there are different languages.
*  In fact, the apparent variation of languages is quite superficial.
*  It's certain, as certain as anything else, is that humans are not genetically programmed
*  to learn one or another language.
*  So you bring up a Japanese baby in Boston, it'll speak Boston English, and you bring
*  up my child in Japan, it'll speak Japanese.
*  And that means that from that it simply follows by logic that the basic structure of the languages
*  must be essentially the same.
*  Our task as scientists is to try to determine exactly what those fundamental principles
*  are that cause the knowledge of language to unfold in the manner in which it does under
*  particular circumstances.
*  And incidentally, I think there is no doubt the same must be true of other aspects of
*  human intelligence and systems of understanding and interpretation and moral and aesthetic
*  judgment and so on.
