# Noam Chomsky - Normal Imperial Practice
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [November 16, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ7gPgk_NTs)
*  A few weeks ago, the US military intentionally bombed a hospital in Kunis, Afghanistan.
*  I mean, the US government felt it enough to just apologize.
*  And there's people leaping to the defense of the establishment here, saying there must have been a good reason.
*  Either they did it on accident, even though we know that they didn't, or there was Taliban hiding in there,
*  and so it justified obviously this human shield logic, just like Israel does.
*  I mean, how does this specific example illustrate how American exceptionalism functions?
*  Well, we have to be careful about the term American exceptionalism.
*  For one thing, it's not at all exceptional.
*  Every imperial power has behaved the same way, sometimes worse.
*  So it's just normal imperial practice.
*  It's called exceptionalism, but nothing about that.
*  Of course, it's supposed to be exceptional in that we have the highest ideals.
*  So maybe we make mistakes, but it's always with the highest ideals.
*  That's American exceptionalism.
*  Except that, too, is true of just about every imperial power.
*  So when the British were destroying the world, they were always doing it with the absolutely highest ideals,
*  the leading figures, leading intellectuals, people like John Stuart Mill,
*  estimable people were describing England as an angelic country beyond anything that anyone's ever imagined.
*  People can't understand how marvelous we are and so on.
*  The French were the same. It's hard to find an exception.
*  So there's no exceptionalism.
*  In the case of the Kunduz Hospital, apparently, I don't think all the details have come out,
*  but it seems that they were trying to kill some people they regarded as Taliban leaders or activists.
*  And they happened to be in the hospital, so they killed everybody.
*  And there is a lot of criticism of killing the others.
*  What about killing the person they were targeting?
*  I mean, what right do we have to kill somebody in some other country who we don't like?
*  I mean, I don't like them either, you know, don't like the Taliban at all.
*  But does that mean we have a right to go kill them?
*  I mean, do they have a right to go kill us if they don't like us?
*  That's not questioned at all.
*  What's questioned is and criticized is attacking a hospital and killing the staff and killing the patients.
*  And, you know, that's not the first time.
*  So, for example, when the US, one of the lauded achievements of the US Army in Iraq is the conquest of Fallujah in November 2004.
*  Take a look at it.
*  Just take a look at the New York Times, the days of the attack on Fallujah.
*  The first day of the attack, there's a picture on the front page.
*  You can practically visualize it, which is a picture of the general hospital in Fallujah.
*  Marines attacked the general hospital, threw the patients off their beds, put them on the floor, put shackles around them, threw the doctors on the floor.
*  Attacking a hospital is a gross violation of international law.
*  But they were asked and they were asked, why did you attack it?
*  They said because it was a propaganda agency for the rebels.
*  How was it a propaganda agency?
*  It was releasing casualty figures.
*  That was OK.
*  That's an achievement.
*  But even beyond that, what were the Marines doing in Fallujah?
*  I mean, are there Iranian Marines in Cambridge?
*  What are US Marines doing in Iraq?
*  The invasion of Iraq is the worst crime of this century.
*  It's had horrible effects, but it's now spawned sectarian conflicts that are tearing the region apart.
*  But suppose it had worked.
*  Suppose it had pacified Iraq and there was no disasters.
*  It's still a major crime.
*  Why do we have the right to invade another country?
*  And in fact, if you look back, there's another crime which is never discussed.
*  In the 1990s, the sanctions on Iraq were so severe that they virtually destroyed the society.
*  In fact, the sanctions were administered by the United Nations.
*  And the international diplomats who administered the sanctions were respected international diplomats.
*  Dennis Halliday, Hans-Francois Bonnick.
*  They both resigned in protest on the grounds that the sanctions were genocidal.
*  Their turn, not mine.
*  They said the sanctions are genocidal.
*  They're destroying the society.
*  They're strengthening the dictator.
*  They're forcing the population to rely on him for survival.
*  And probably they saved him from being overthrown from within, as happened to one after another, a dictator of the same sort.
*  That was the 1990s.
*  That's considered no problem.
*  That was liberal Democrats.
*  By the time that Bush and Blair decided to invade Iraq, the society was half-devastated.
*  So you hit a very fragile system with a sledgehammer, you're going to have horrible results.
*  But the very idea of invading is criminal.
*  And try to find someone who describes it as a crime.
*  Right.
*  Obama is praised because he describes it as a mistake.
*  Does he describe it as a crime?
*  Does anyone?
*  Except way out at the fringes.
*  It was the dumb war, right?
*  Dumb war. We shouldn't do dumb things. We should do smart things.
*  It's like German generals after Stalingrad, who said it's really stupid to have a two-front war.
*  We should have destroyed England first.
*  Well, I always think it's interesting that people use the rationale that we didn't find WMDs
*  as if that would have been a rationale to invade and occupy a country, finding weapons of mass destruction.
*  I mean, it's insane.
*  Completely insane.
*  If they're concerned about weapons of mass destruction, there are ways to proceed.
*  The U.N. inspectors are doing a fine job.
*  Actually, pretty much the same similar questions arise in the case of the Iran nuclear deal.
*  So Iran, according to the United States, poses a grave threat to the world.
*  That's pretty much an American and Israeli obsession.
*  Most of the world doesn't see it that way.
*  But let's say it's a threat. Suppose Iran poses a threat.
*  Are there simple ways of dealing with this?
*  In fact, there are.
*  And in fact, very popular ones.
*  The best way to deal with it would be to work towards instituting a nuclear weapons-free zone in the region.
*  That's supported by almost the entire world.
*  It's strongly supported by Iran.
*  In fact, they're one of the leading advocates of it.
*  Yeah, when you're not even acknowledging that Israel has them, then how can you...
*  That's the problem.
*  The U.S. won't permit it because it does not want Israeli nuclear weapons to be open to inspection.
*  So therefore, we block the obvious way to deal with whatever problem there is.
*  And it is supported by virtually the entire world.
*  It comes up every five years at the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference.
*  And in fact, the continuation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty is actually contingent on doing this.
*  That was agreed 20 years ago.
*  That's the most important arms control treaty there is.
*  If that treaty collapses, we're gone.
*  Everybody will have nuclear weapons and be using them.
*  But the U.S. is so committed to protecting Israel's nuclear weapons that it's willing to endanger the Non-Proliferation Treaty
*  and prevent the obvious means from keeping nuclear weapons away from Iran in case they have any interest in developing them.
*  Do you see a word of discussion of this outside of the arms control literature and the high-right articles,
*  but way out of the fringes?
*  Nothing that could possibly make the mainstream.
