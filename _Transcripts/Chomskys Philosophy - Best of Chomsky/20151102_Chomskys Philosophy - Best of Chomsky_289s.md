# Noam Chomsky vs. William Buckley - Disinterested Relations
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [November 02, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vViS1biOFXc)
*  Mr. Chomsky, we're talking there about American terror, and I think you make a very accurate
*  observation that we are responsible for what we do, but hardly responsible for what other
*  people do, except in so far as we are in a position to influence them.
*  For instance, if there is a mass starvation in a biafra, even though we did not cause
*  it, there is a sense in which we are responsible if we don't do something to attempt to alleviate
*  it.
*  And in the same token, if we are prepared to agree that it is not always easy to taxonomize
*  military action into that which is terroristic and that which is purely military operation,
*  we are left with doubts, for instance, about the bombing of Germany in 1942, 43, 44.
*  You might contend that this was terroristic and unnecessary, and you might be right, although
*  you're not a military expert, neither am I.
*  But I do judge.
*  Yeah, but I do judge that even if we all agree that what we did in Dresden was inexcusable,
*  as a moral question, it's got to be understood in the context of what was it that brought
*  us to Dresden in the first instance.
*  And what brought us to South Vietnam in the first instance, in my judgment, was clearly
*  an uninterested, or I should say disinterested, concern for the stability and possibilities
*  of a region of the world.
*  At what period do you feel that we had this disinterested relationship?
*  Right now.
*  No, at what period did we have it?
*  Did it begin, let's say, 1951, for example, when the State Department bulletin points
*  out that we must help the French reconquer their former colony and we must eradicate
*  all Vietnamese resistance down to its last roots in order to reestablish French power?
*  To increase my vulnerability, I wish we had helped the French.
*  We did.
*  But not sufficiently.
*  Well, but it was hardly disinterested when we attempted, with tremendous support, in
*  fact, to reinstate French imperialism in South Vietnam.
*  It was disinterested in this sense, and I think this is an important distinction for
*  you to touch on in your book.
*  It's a disinterested act if my attempt to help, or your attempt to help, a particular
*  nation is in order to spare you the possibility of a great ordeal in the future which will
*  harm you, your family, your children, your public.
*  In that sense, Nazi Germany was also disinterested.
*  In fact, Nazi Germany was conquering Eastern Europe only in order to advance the values
*  of the Christian spiritual civilization and to restore the Slavs to their rightful home
*  and so on and so forth.
*  Totally disinterested.
*  Look, I follow you.
*  I follow you.
*  But if you want me to pursue that digression, I will.
*  But let's suspend it for a moment.
*  I'm distinguishing that kind of disinterestedness between the kind of...
*  But that's not a kind of disinterestedness.
*  You see, that's something which includes as a special case every case of military aggression
*  and colonialism in history.
*  It's all disinterested in your sense.
*  Well, let me simply rest my case by saying that there is an observable distinction by
*  intelligent men between a country that reaches out and interferes with the affairs of another
*  country because it has reason to believe that a failure to do so will result in universal
*  misery and that country which reaches out interferes with another country because it
*  wants to establish Coca-Cola plants and chase national banks and whatever and exploit it.
*  Now, that is observable.
*  It's a conceptual...
*  Well, let's distinguish between a conceptual distinction and a factual distinction.
*  It is a conceptual distinction, but in actual fact, the history of colonialism shows that
*  these two motivations coincide.
*  That is practically every...
*  I mean, there are exceptions.
*  You know, probably the Belgians and the Congor are an exception.
*  But by and large, the major imperialist ventures have been in the economic... in the material
*  interest or in the perceived material interest.
*  I'm not interested in the mathematics.
*  Let me finish.
*  You have already conceded that it's not merely a conceptual difference.
*  I say it is a conceptual...
*  There are exceptions.
*  There are a few exceptions.
*  All right.
*  Okay.
*  Let's talk about the exceptions then.
*  Well, no, but the exceptions are at the different...
*  No, wait a minute.
*  The exceptions...
*  I mentioned, for example, the Belgians and the Congo.
*  There, they didn't even pretend to have a civilizing mission.
*  There was pure material self-interest.
*  These are the exceptions.
*  There are, as far as I know, no exceptions on the other side.
*  There are...
*  I mean, maybe I've left out a case of history, but as I see the history of colonialism, the
*  great mass of cases are cases where a powerful country was working in its perceived material
*  self-interest and was covering what it was doing to itself and to the world with very
*  pleasant phrases about preserving Christian values or helping the poor benighted natives
*  or one thing or another.
