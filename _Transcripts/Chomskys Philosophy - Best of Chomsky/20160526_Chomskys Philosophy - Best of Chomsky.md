# Noam Chomsky - Human Nature II
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [May 26, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D1jlC9Y_go)
*  Is there such a thing as human nature?
*  Or are the groups or the people who deny the possibility of such a thing, which includes
*  the great Manny Marxist, correct in denying that there is any such thing as human nature?
*  Well, either there is such a thing as human nature, or humans or angels from another planet
*  or another universe.
*  I mean, any organism that exists in the organic world has a nature.
*  That's what distinguishes it from other organisms.
*  So we're different from insects, we're different from apes, and so on and so forth.
*  And that can either be because we're like other organisms and we have some kind of a
*  nature, or it's because maybe God implanted us in the world or something like that.
*  Those are the two options.
*  Now, you're absolutely right about Marxists.
*  People call themselves Marxists.
*  In fact, even well-known Marxists like Gramsci say that there's no nature, human nature is
*  just history.
*  If you can find a couple of phrases like that in Marx, they can't have meant what they said.
*  What they probably meant was human nature can take many different, have many different
*  exemplifications depending on circumstances, which is of course true.
*  His name is true of insects.
*  But this has become a kind of a slogan.
*  It's considered that if you, on the left, or what's called the left, that if you deny
*  that there's any human nature, you're in favor of change.
*  If you say there is a human nature, you've got to be reactionary because you're saying
*  people have to be rotten and have slaves and so on.
*  There's nothing like that.
*  In fact, if you take a look at Marx, who they pay filth to, he was a dedicated believer
*  in human nature.
*  In fact, he took most of his ideas right out of the Enlightenment and the Romantic period
*  where he lived.
*  Then he carried them over.
*  That's his concept of alienation, for example.
*  Somehow, your fundamental nature is a need for creative work under your own control.
*  If it's dominated by others, you get alienated labor.
*  The whole story comes out of that.
*  It's based on a conception of human nature.
*  Is there any evidence for it?
*  Let's take the real study.
*  Let's assume we're not angels.
*  We're organisms.
*  Therefore, there is human nature.
*  Then we try to discover what it is.
*  Well, we do it the way we discover what being nature is.
*  It's much harder.
*  We're much more complicated organisms.
*  Unlike other organisms, we can't do direct experiments.
*  If you want to study the parts of human nature that have to do with the issues that matter
*  in human affairs, you can't do anything much in the way of comparative evidence because
*  humans are just different.
*  There isn't much in the way of comparative evidence.
*  Some but pretty thin.
*  What there is is at an evolutionary distance of 12 or 15 million years, that's a long time,
*  other animals have changed and we've changed.
*  You just don't get much.
*  There's some comparative evidence but not much.
*  In fact, experimental evidence, yes, there's some in some areas.
*  Like take, say, language where I work.
*  There's quite a lot of evidence there.
*  It's a unique human property.
*  There's nothing remotely like it in the animal world as far as we know.
*  But you can learn a lot about it because it's kind of isolated and you can separate it from
*  other things.
*  Actually, many of the questions you'd like to ask about language are beyond experiment,
*  the traditional questions.
*  For example, how you and I are doing what we're now doing.
*  How are we able to produce freely new expressions that have maybe new ideas that have never
*  been expressed.
*  You say it, I understand it and so on and so forth.
*  What's sometimes called the creative aspect of language use, which is a big topic in the
*  tradition.
*  Descartes, Rousseau, Humboldt, others.
*  But we can't study that.
*  We can study the mechanisms that are into it, but not much about the...
*  As soon as you get the choice and decision and so on, you're kind of at sea.
*  But there are a lot of topics you can study.
*  There are many that are beyond what we know how to study, but there's got to be a nature.
*  Otherwise we're kind of like, either we're angels or kind of like amoebas.
*  Anything that happens to us just shapes us and we become some shapeless form of it.
*  Otherwise a baby could grow up to be a penguin.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  I mean, like there's a huge debate about whether there's an innate language faculty.
*  The answer to that is so trivial that you could have to wonder who's asking the question.
*  I mean, like if say my granddaughter and her pet, a chimp or songbird or whatever, have
*  exactly the same data, how come my granddaughter picks out of the data something that's language
*  related reflexively of course, and then again reflexively ends up doing what you and I are
*  doing, whereas the other animal is going to take the first step.
*  Well, it's either a miracle or she's got a language faculty.
*  There's no other option, but there's a huge debate about that, even among people called
*  scientists.
*  People are extremely rational about themselves for some reason, but yes, there has to be
*  a human nature if there wasn't, you know, it's stuff that's inconceivable and we can
*  try to find out what it is.
*  Well, you know, on issues that really matter to us, the sciences don't tell us very much.
*  I'll tell you a little.
*  So for example, why are people say altruistic?
*  Why do you help others?
*  Okay, there's some evidence from biology.
*  Most of it just sort of gives some basis for what you know anyway.
*  So people tend to be more caring for their children than for their cousins, let's say.
*  Okay, you can give a story about kin selection, you know, the genes that get proliferated
*  and so on.
*  It tells you something.
*  I mean, it doesn't tell you why people on Cape Cod go into icy waters and storms to
*  try to rescue stranded dolphins.
*  No kin relation, but they do it, you know.
*  And it doesn't tell you why they spend huge effort in doing that, but they don't care
*  about a kid starving across the street.
*  They don't tell you where to take care of your stepchildren, you know, where you know
*  their stepchildren.
*  I mean, so yeah, it tells you something.
*  And there are some, there's one category, reciprocal altruism, worked on by Robert Trivers,
*  a very good biologist, which actually has some interesting results.
*  You help somebody else, they help you, you know, so on.
*  Most things you just have to rely on what we call intuition, you know, meaning introspection,
*  experience, you know, evidence of history, whatever they may be.
*  And you can get some not vacuous speculations about what human beings are like.
*  What's the utility of the view that there is no human nature that causes it to be widespread,
*  particularly on the left?
*  The utility is that you can convince yourself if you're sufficiently irrational that that
*  means we can introduce changes.
*  Incidentally, these views are extremely popular among a segment of the left, the Leninist
*  segment.
*  They may deny it.
*  But these views are useful for people who want to be managers.
*  If there's no human nature, then if I control people, there's no moral barrier to it.
*  Because if there's no human nature anyway, I can determine what they should be.
*  And of course, I'm completely benevolent because there's no human nature or other people there
*  is for me.
*  So I'm benevolent and I know what's right.
*  And therefore, I can kind of help these amoebas to turn into good things instead of bad things.
*  It's a very convenient doctrine for the managerial quest.
*  There are people who will respond to the idea of justice, equity, fairness, people controlling
*  their own lives.
*  And they'll say, oh, yeah, it sounds nice.
*  But human nature precludes it.
*  Human nature is such that, and I'm talking about caring people who will just say, yeah,
*  of course I'd like to live in a better world like that.
*  But it's like asking a tree to fly.
*  It's not possible because there is a human nature.
*  And human nature is such that it precludes the possibility of that kind of situation
*  and yields instead what we see all around us and what we've seen through history.
*  How would you try to talk to, to counter, to address that kind of view, which is very
*  widespread?
*  Well, two ways.
*  First, the way you try to evaluate any factual statement.
*  You made a factual claim.
*  Back it up.
*  Do you have scientific basis for it?
*  Do you have evidence for it?
*  They're going to say, my evidence is all over.
*  I have a history of, well, that's what they're going to say.
*  I have a history of suffering and conflict and denial and benevolence and dedication
*  to improving things.
*  Yeah, history tells you all kinds of things.
*  Doesn't tell you what you want.
*  The same history can tell you the opposite if you want.
*  So you're picking out of history certain features which happen to have an interesting consequence.
*  They prevent you from doing anything.
*  They're very self-serving.
*  I mean, if nothing can be changed, then it's fine if you just want to be Ayn Rand or something.
*  But you have no evidence for it.
*  Because if you take a look at history, you just as well find the opposite.
*  You can show in history that Kropotkin was right in saying that mutual aid is a factor
*  in evolution.
*  It's as good as the evidence to the contrary.
*  So you take the range of history and experience and so on.
*  You can pick out something that will justify you in just looking out for number one.
*  Or you can take something that would justify you in devoting yourself to the welfare of
*  others.
*  It's your choice.
*  You can't claim any argument from history.
*  In fact, if you really take arguments from history seriously, we could argue about how
*  seriously you should do it.
*  But there is something noticeable.
*  There is a tendency throughout history towards more and more commitment to justice, equity,
*  and freedom.
*  And you see it pretty clearly.
*  We even see it in our own lifetimes.
*  Take say women's rights, rights of minorities, concern over future generations, the environmentalist
*  movement.
*  It was very limited 40 or 50 years ago.
*  Now it's quite broad.
*  If you go back further, say the right to vote, right to associate, right of freedom of speech.
*  By and large, there has been a, there is regression, a lot of horrible things, but
*  one pretty noticeable tendency in history is towards more freedom and justice and equity.
*  But the interesting thing, actually one of the interesting things is when you, when people
*  engage in antisocial behavior, they have to, and routinely do, act as though that's not
*  what they're doing.
*  They cover it with a rationalization.
*  Well, why would you need to do that?
*  If antisocial behavior was actually wired in and part of us, we wouldn't alibi it.
*  We would just say that's what we're doing.
*  I mean, a wolf wouldn't say I'm eating the sheep because I'm trying to help the sheep.
*  It would just say I'm eating the sheep because I'm hungry.
*  And the same thing goes for human.
*  No, nobody does that.
*  Henry Kissinger probably would say it if on the Cambodia bombing.
*  But you know, if, yeah, that's a good argument.
*  Why do you bother to rationalize?
